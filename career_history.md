# Career History — Authoritative Context

## Purpose

This document captures Mike Hall’s professional history in a structured, machine-readable format suitable for LLM-driven resume modernization.
It emphasizes **scope, leverage, ownership, and durable impact** over chronology.

---

## Candidate Identity

- **Name:** Mike Hall
- **Target Levels:** Staff Engineer, Principal Engineer
- **Operating Mode:** Senior IC / Architect (no formal authority required)

**Primary Themes:**

- Legacy system recovery and modernization
- Platform resilience under real production load
- Observability as an architectural primitive
- Organizational unblocking without positional power
- Developer enablement and systems thinking

---

## Career Phases (High-Level)

### Phase 1 — Foundations of Scale and Reliability (2001–2008)

**Domains:** .NET, enterprise systems, mainframe integration, early CI/CD
**Signal:** Early exposure to production failure modes, revenue systems, and cross-org coordination.

**Key outcomes:**

- Built and stabilized revenue-critical systems (TicketsNow, JPMorgan, BrightStar).
- Introduced CI/CD pipelines before “DevOps” was mainstream.
- Diagnosed and resolved systemic failures spanning .NET and mainframe systems.
- Led resolution efforts across organizational boundaries.

**Durability:**

- Revenue uplift ($2M/year at TicketsNow).
- CI/CD and deployment practices adopted beyond original teams.

---

### Phase 2 — Craftsmanship, Communities, and Scale (2009–2016)

**Domains:** Ruby/Rails, large-scale web platforms, developer culture
**Signal:** Influence beyond code through standards, education, and community leadership.

**Key outcomes:**

- Core contributor during Groupon hypergrowth; worked on fraud, deal services, and platform reliability.
- Designed fraud detection pipelines using Vertica, Hadoop, and Clojure.
- Built and ran global engineering onboarding and training programs.
- Founded WHOIS Tech Community / UGtastic; interviewed key figures shaping modern software practice.

**Durability:**

- Training programs outlived role.
- Community content remains referenced in craftsmanship circles.
- Cultural impact across multiple organizations.

---

### Phase 3 — Platform Ownership and Modernization (2017–2021)

**Domains:** Rails, Postgres, Redis, ETL, observability precursors
**Signal:** Repeated pattern of inheriting fragile systems and making them operable again.

**Key outcomes:**

- Migrated legacy systems to modern Rails/Ruby versions.
- Replaced pathological database patterns with materialized views and JSONB strategies.
- Built ETL pipelines handling millions of records (SendGrid migration).
- Reduced operational cost and latency through Redis adoption.
- Introduced structured onboarding, review practices, and tooling standards.

**Durability:**

- Systems remained operable and maintainable after departure.
- Reduced long-term operational load.

---

### Phase 4 — Staff-Level Systems Leadership (2021–2025)

**Organization:** OneMain Financial
**Domains:** Large Rails monoliths, distributed systems, observability, compliance
**Signal:** De-facto Staff/Principal engineer operating at organizational scale, with sustained ownership across multiple years and initiatives.

#### Core Responsibilities

- Architectural ownership of the Acquisitions Lane (high-risk, revenue-critical).
- Platform modernization under regulatory and operational constraints.
- Separation of platform vs product concerns via Acquisitions Enablement.
- Incident-driven system recovery and long-term remediation planning.

#### Key Outcomes

- Delivered DynamoDB/CookieOverflow remediation eliminating systemic outages.
- Led Rails platform upgrades addressing EOL, security, and compliance risks.
- Founded and led the OpenTelemetry Working Group for over two years.
- Enabled enterprise-wide observability adoption.
- Unified fragmented teams and stabilized delivery under pressure.
- Acted as primary escalation point for legacy system failures.

**Durability:**

- Observability standards and OpenTelemetry adoption persisted beyond individual initiatives.
- Platform remediation reduced recurring incidents and institutional risk.

**Influence:**

- Decisions shaped across engineering, product, cyber, and leadership without formal authority.

## Signature Patterns (For Resume Extraction)

These patterns repeat across roles and should be emphasized over job titles:

- **Legacy Reclamation:** Enter broken, poorly understood systems → restore operability → enable change.
- **Platform Thinking:** Treat observability, CI/CD, and data integrity as first-class architecture.
- **Leverage Without Authority:** Drive change through clarity, artifacts, and execution.
- **Durable Fixes:** Prefer structural remediation over tactical patches.
- **Human Systems Awareness:** Improve team function alongside technical systems.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals (For Resume Pruning)

The following should be compressed or omitted unless directly supporting Staff/Principal signal:

- Early career job-by-job task lists
- Tool inventories without outcomes
- Titles not aligned with demonstrated operating level
- Short-term consulting details without durable impact

---

## Resume Rewrite Guidance (For LLMs)

When generating or editing resume bullets:

- Prefer **“eliminated X class of failure”** over **“worked on X.”**
- Quantify blast radius, duration, or risk reduction where possible.
- Emphasize second-order effects (teams unblocked, systems stabilized).
- Collapse pre-2015 experience into a single **Selected Earlier Experience** section.

---

## How This File Should Be Used by LLMs

- This document is authoritative for interpreting intent, scope, and durable impact.
- It should inform _how_ resume bullets are written, not be copied verbatim.
- Where resume YAML lacks context, prefer interpretations consistent with the patterns and phases described here.
- If resume content conflicts with this document, flag the conflict rather than resolving it silently.

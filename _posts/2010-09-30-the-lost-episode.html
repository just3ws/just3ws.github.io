<p>Back in August we sat down to chat with Rob Reynolds and Dru Sellers about the Nu project. At the time, I hadn't even edited the interview with Brian Hogan yet. So in a death spiral of external events and general procrastination sprinkled with a little bit of exhaustion for good measure, I haven't gotten around to editing the episode... yet. First I want to apologize to you, our listener for not being more prompt with the turn around on new content. I can make excuses but those don't make for good listening. And I want to apologize to Rob and Dru for taking the time to sit down with us and I didn't return the courtesy by getting the episode out in a timely manner. I'm going to sit down over the next couple days and get the episode together as a "Rough Cut" (really, all of our episodes probably would be described as "Rough Cuts" anyway) and at least get Rob and Dru's insights into the .NET F/OSS world and the great work they're doing with Nu into your ears.</p>

<p>I bought a T-Mobile G1 Android phone either on or around the official launch date and thought it was going to be another gadget/toy that would be fun for awhile and then just be an oversized battery eater after a few weeks. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>At first I wasn’t sure what to do with the thing, until I found Google Market. I’ve not owned an iPhone so I can’t compare the experience to the Apple Store but I can’t imagine an easier process. Like most people would I downloaded a bunch of crap, games, etc. but thanks to the rating and review system it didn’t take long for the wheat to be seperated from the chaff and some really amazing applications turned my new toy into an indispensible extension to my arm.</p>
<p>ShopSavvy: a tool that uses the built-in camera to scan barcodes and then looks up competitive prices online and links to user reviews.</p>
<p>Tweedroid: a great little Twitter client and reader.</p>
<p>wpToGo: a WordPress.com client to manage your blog. The tool that I am using to write this post with.</p>
<p>ToddlerLock: a utility to entertain the little one without accidentally dialing Warsaw. It also puts the phone in airplane mode so you don’t irradiate your youngling.</p>
<p>The built in email client that supports IMAP and the integrated Google suite of tools that also supports Google for Domains is critical.</p>
<p>And the obligatory game, Bonsai Blast. I had to play it all the way through. Unbelievably slick, fun and free!</p>
<p>Every application I described is available for free via the built-in Market application.</p>

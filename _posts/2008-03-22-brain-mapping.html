<p>What made me begin to unconsciously type "worlofwarcraft.com" into my internet browser address bar. (really)<br><br>Here's the scenario<br><br>It all starts here.  Reading a nice little <a target="_blank" href="https://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Stargate-Code-of-the-Replicators.aspx" title="DailyWTF: 'Stargate: Code of the Replicators'" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> about the "faux-code" used on a very entertaining <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1" title="Stargate SG-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">show</a>, although I like the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis" title="Stargate Atlantis. Needs more Teal'c (Kind of like Spock, but awesome).'" rel="noopener noreferrer">spin-off</a> better.  Because I was reading the article using my RSS feed reader of <a target="_blank" href="https://sage.mozdev.org/" title="Sage" rel="noopener noreferrer">choice</a> I only saw a link to the comments on a popular link <a target="_blank" href="https://digg.com/" title="digg" rel="noopener noreferrer">aggregation site</a>.  There was only one <a target="_blank" href="https://digg.com/television/Stargate_the_code_behind_the_Replicators" title="Digg: ''. Quoted from the great minds of the internet, &quot;so close to C++ it's actually Javascript, dumb ass&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> on the site, that fully followed a key <a target="_blank" href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19" title="What is the sum of this equation? (Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience)" rel="noopener noreferrer">law regarding internet anonymity</a>.<br><br>Okay, my brain works... strange.</p>

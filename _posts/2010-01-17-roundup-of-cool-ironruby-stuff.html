<p>This is the laziest blog post of the month. I’ve been completely distracted this afternoon playing around with IronRuby. Last night I got Ruby on Rails running on the latest release of IronRuby. Took all of 15 minutes to be up and running. Earlier last week I created a simple test using RSpec on IronRuby to test my project. And I’ve already got my builds all running on Albacore. And last but not least, I’ve grabbed the IsItIronRuby.com domain, and am looking at posting the existing IsItRuby19.com and IsItJRuby.com sites. I got the source code and got the site running on Ruby 1.8.6, but have to play around with IronRuby. Some of the plugins may have issues, so I may need to find alternatives. Anyway, having lots of fun with IronRuby while my daughter naps! It’s definitely a hot language, so hot that working in it makes my poor laptop’s fan spin like crazy.</p>

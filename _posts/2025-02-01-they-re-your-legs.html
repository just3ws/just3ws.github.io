<p> A few weeks ago, I was at Valvoline getting an oil change.  </p>

<p> It was a busy day—<strong>full bays, a strong shop lead keeping things moving, and a small crew working fast.</strong> Watching them coordinate, I was impressed. I was enjoying the moment so much that I even agreed to buy an air filter replacement—something I usually do myself.  </p>

<p> My car was due for a tire rotation, so I stepped out while they lifted it.  </p>

<p> The manager helped the younger mechanics <strong>stabilize the lift, ensuring it was locked in place before moving to the next car.</strong>  </p>

<p> Everything looked good.  </p>

<p> And then—<strong>I saw it.</strong>  </p>

<p> One of the mechanics sat <strong>cross-legged under the rear axle.</strong>  </p>

<p> 🚨 <strong>My dad’s voice hit me before I even realized I was moving.</strong> 🚨  </p>

<p> I was through the door. <strong>“Hey, don’t cross bones. Don’t trust that jack.”</strong>  </p>

<p> The young mechanic looked up. “I’m okay,” he said.  </p>

<p> I just shrugged. <strong>“Okay. They’re your legs.”</strong>  </p>

<p> And he moved back.  </p>

<h3> A Team Owns Its Own Safety  </h3>

<p> Once they were done, I spoke with two of the younger mechanics—a <strong>young man who had been working on my car and a young woman who had been listening in as she finished her task.</strong>  </p>

<p> I reminded them about their buddy—the one who <strong>hand-waved</strong> his safety, the one who thought <strong>he’d be fine under the axle.</strong>  </p>

<p> I told them:  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Kneeling might be uncomfortable.</strong>   </p>

<p> 🚨 <strong>But it’s a lot more comfortable than getting crushed.</strong>  </p>

<p> And more importantly—<strong>his safety is their problem, too.</strong>  </p>

<p> If he gets pinned, it won’t just be <strong>his</strong> crisis. <strong>It’ll be theirs.</strong> It’ll be <strong>them</strong> trying to save him. It’ll be <strong>them</strong> listening to the screams.  </p>

<p> Because a team isn’t just responsible for their own safety. <strong>They’re responsible for making sure everyone makes it home.</strong>  </p>

<h3> I Grew Up in a Shop. I Know What Happens When You Get It Wrong.  </h3>

<p> I grew up in a shop. My father was a <strong>lead diesel mechanic and later an owner-operator. Keeping him on the road was priority number one.</strong>  </p>

<p> By 13, I was <strong>breaking down truck tires, armed with nothing but a breaker bar and the will to get it done.</strong>  </p>

<p> By my late teens, I was running the yard while my dad was on the road. <strong>When he came back, he’d tell me what needed to be done, then go to sleep so he could get back on the highway.</strong>  </p>

<p> That meant I had to work <strong>alone</strong>—late at night, in a steel building, with machines that didn’t care if I lived or died.  </p>

<p> <strong>There was no room for mistakes.</strong>  </p>

<p> 🛠 <strong>I had to know how to be safe—because no one was there to save me if I wasn’t.</strong>   </p>

<p> 🛠 <strong>I had to respect the work—because there’s no such thing as "I’ll fix it later" when you’re under 80,000 pounds of steel.</strong>  </p>

<p> My dad drilled it into me:  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Never trust a jack.</strong> Always <strong>block and chock.</strong>   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Assume everything is heavier, sharper, and more dangerous than it looks.</strong>   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Know the difference between discomfort and disaster.</strong> A little discomfort today beats a lifetime of regret.   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Never rush safety.</strong> You’ll never get back the time you lose if you get it wrong.  </p>

<p> The lesson was clear:  </p>

<p> 👉 <strong>The best way to learn safety isn’t through experience—it’s through listening to those who already have it.</strong>  </p>

<h3> This Moment Meant Something.  </h3>

<p> As I got into my car, I called out— <strong>“Hey, stay safe.”</strong>  </p>

<p> And he hollered back— <strong>“I will.”</strong>  </p>

<p> That moment stuck with me.  </p>

<p> I was raised to be independent. To survive. But when it comes to safety, no one is truly alone—it’s always a shared responsibility.  </p>

<p> Today, <strong>I’m not the kid in the shop anymore.</strong> I’m older. A professional software engineer. My world today is almost unimaginable to that younger version of me.  </p>

<p> But when I see someone who reminds me of <strong>the kid I used to be?</strong>  </p>

<p> I can’t walk away without making sure <strong>they know what I know.</strong>  </p>

<p> Because sometimes, that’s the difference between <strong>walking away from the job at the end of the day—</strong> And <strong>not walking at all.</strong>  </p>

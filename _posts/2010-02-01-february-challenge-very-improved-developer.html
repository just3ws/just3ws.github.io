<p>Okay, here’s my next personal challenge. Learn Vim. Period. I’m taking away all my editors, save Visual Studio. I need Visual Studio to pay the bills (for now). So bye-bye TextPad, Netbeans, Aptana, Komodo Edit, Monodevelop, Livewriter, e TextEditor and Notepad++. I’m gonna be a Vim’er by the end of the month.</p>
<p>This means all my non-Visual Studio related text editing needs must be processed through Vim. No dropping into Notepad cheating. I have to relearn my traditional text management flow to utilize Vim.</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m installing ViEmu for Visual Studio and Sql Server Studio. Because I’m a masochist.</p>

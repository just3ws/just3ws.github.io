<p><span style="color:#000080;">EDIT: Mea culpa, I didn’t fact check this posting.  The Carl Franklin who spoke is one of the founders of the Chicago Architects Group but not the same <a href="https://www.franklins.net/carl.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carl Franklin</a> from .NET Rocks!, I apologize for the mis-information.  I assure you that I was appropriately embarrassed when I found out this mistake at the meeting.  Thanks.</span></p>

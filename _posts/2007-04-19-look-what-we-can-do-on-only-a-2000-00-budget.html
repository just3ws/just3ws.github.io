<p>Look what we can do on only a $2000.00<b>*</b> budget!<br><br>*Not including the cost of a real-estate appraisal, a dedicated team consisting of one professional home designer, and two or three professional contractors/carpenters for about two to three weeks.<br><br><a href="https://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/shows_hdts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Designed to Sell</a> is my wife's newest obsession.<br><br>I wonder how far that two-grand would go if they had to include the labor in that budget?  Two days, TOPS!<br><br>Granted, they seem to do good work, and if the follow-up information is accurate they do help people make money above their original asking price.  That and the host seems like a decent chap and the crew is more personable than most of the home improvement shows.<br><br>I just make sure to remind my wife exactly what the two-thousand dollar budget <i>isn't</i> counting.</p>

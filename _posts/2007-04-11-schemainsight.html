<p>SchemaInSight<br><br>Most code generation code is intended for generating data-access code.  There doesn't seem to be any simple (or free) code for accessing a database and enumerating the database objects.<br><br>The database objects that can be accessed using the SchemaInSight tool include:<br><br>The database's themselves.<br>The database tables and views.<br>Stored procedure parameters, and results.  At least for simple stored procedures.<br><br>In the future I would like to extend it to include functions, custom types and anything else I can't think of right now.</p>

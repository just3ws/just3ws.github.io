<p>I’m a little neurotic about my desktop wallpaper. As a developer, I spend an inordinate amount of time staring at my computer. Granted, I’m rarely looking at a blank desktop but I like to have something tasteful and artistic when I want to access something on my desktop with my Win+D key chord.</p>
<p>One day I was sitting by a business analyst while collaborating on a project and noticed his nice desktop image. He introduced me to <a title="VladStudio.com" href="https://vladstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VladStudio</a>, a Russian artist who has been pumping out hundreds of beautiful designs. He even has a system tray application called <a href="https://www.vladstudio.com/companion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Companion</a> than can change your wallpaper based on a custom schedule or whenever you just decide you need a new look by just double-clicking the system tray icon.</p>
<p>He provides low-resolution images for free that are still gorgeous. But you can get lifetime access to high resolution images for under $30.00 US <a title="Register for VladStudio.com" href="https://vladstudio.com/register/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. The registration is worth it if only to help him to keep creating designs. I registered several months ago, and he has since added widescreen resolutions images that look even better on my big wide Gateway.</p>
<p>The best part is the the images are very tasteful. I never have to worry about walking away from my workstation and returning to find an email from the HR department. Now I have people asking me where I got my nice desktop image.</p>

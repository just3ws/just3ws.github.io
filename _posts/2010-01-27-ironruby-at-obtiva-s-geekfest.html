<p>I got a chance to present IronRuby to a group of some of the most hardcore Ruby fanatics in Chicago today. And I’ve survived to tell the tale. Not too much to say other than my .NET cohort at Obtiva Scott Parker aka @citizenparker presented the DLR and what it means for languages like Ruby and Python. Then I closed with a quick presentation on IronRuby and a tidbit of some other Ruby goodness that has been adopted by the .NET community.</p>
<p>I’ve attached the slides here.</p>
<p>Slide deck: <a href="https://just3ws.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/ironruby.pptx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IronRuby</a></p>
<p>BTW, I wrote the slide deck this morning before I left for my commute. So I’m pretty happy with the results. If Scott says it’s okay I’ll add his presentation to this post later.</p>

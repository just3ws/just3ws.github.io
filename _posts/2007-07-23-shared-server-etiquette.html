<b>Log off</b><p>Don't stay logged into shared machines, log off when you are done. The performance overhead of multiple logged in users is bad enough when we're all working, but do we really need 4 instances of ScrnSve.exe running too? Also, if you're logged in but unavailable then managing the machine is more difficult if a reboot needs to be done or other system maintenance. And for Knuth's sake, please don't stay logged in over night.</p>

<b>Disable the screensaver.</b> <br><p>Sure, we can't be constantly logging in and out, there are times we will be working for extended periods of time on the shared server and may be pulled away during that time. No sense in running another application whose only purpose in life is to burn cycles and render pretty pictures when no one is looking.</p>

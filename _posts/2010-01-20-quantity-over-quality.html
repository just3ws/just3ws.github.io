<p>Last night I had a severe case of writer’s block when I sat down to write my post. I already wrote my easy posts and didn’t have time for researching a more advanced topic. Then my daughter was demandind Daddy to be present for her bedtime. So that’s my excuse for no post yesterday.</p>
<p>as I laid down and gave my daughter her sleepytime milk I pondered on Software Craftsmanship and quality. Software Craftsmanship’s mandate to put “Quality over crap!” is important for the products that you create. And I think it’s important for the information you share. But there is value in quantity as well. Sometimes you just have to “git’r'dun”, no matter how queasy that colloquialism makes you feel.</p>
<p>Quuality in your software is important. Good principles put into practice will help you to produce high quality, reliable and verifiable applications. But sometimes things just need to be done quickly.</p>

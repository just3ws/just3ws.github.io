<p>The planning has begun for the second annual Chicago Code Camp. To put it in software development terms, we’re still in the “early alpha pre-release” phase. As soon as we have concrete information available I’ll post more details. In the meantime this is all I can say about the event.</p>
<p>- It’s going to be in Chicago, or at least very close. Definitely in Illinois<br>
- it will be a software developer oriented event.<br>
- the speakers will be real software developers. Not cardboard cutouts.<br>
- there will be a website within the next few weeks.<br>
- start thinking about a talk you’d like to give.<br>
- this event will be *the awesome*</p>
<p>stay tuned for more info.</p>

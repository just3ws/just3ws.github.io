<p>Okay, a film, albeit highly-stylized, about an actual historical event is "moronic", a "sword'n'sandals" "dumb audience-friendly" romp.<br><br>Yet, a gimmick laden movie about strippers, zombies and psychotic stuntmen is to be considered high-art.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Let's compare the cultural contributions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Herodotus</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Histories_of_Herodotus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Histories</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Miller_%28comics%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Miller</a> (The Dark Knight Returns, Sin City, 300, etc.).<br><br>To <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quentin Tarantino</a> (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Grindhouse, etc.) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rodriguez" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Rodriguez</a> (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, etc.).<br><br>Hmm.  Unless I think that the height of cultural contributions is clever, hipster, 70's references and cheesy faux-exploitation rip-offs then I think I'm going to just stick with being a fan of the "moronic" and "dumb".<br><br>Just because the director is a pretentious, eccentric weirdo does not make the film fine-art.<br><br>I wonder how much history information has been sought out due to the over-whelming intellectual stimulation of Grindhouse?  I guess I missed the History Channel <a href="http://boards.historychannel.com/thread.jspa?threadID=800019707&amp;messageID=700171198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special</a>.</p>

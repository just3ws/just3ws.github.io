<p>Greasy-wheel Driven Development</p>
<p>All development is driven by whomever is screaming loudest.  Project priority is determined through a bidding type system where the competing requests are escalated up to the next highest person in the management chain.  Progress is managed by continuous nagging and veiled threats to whatever resources are assigned to, or at least coerced into working on, the issue.</p>

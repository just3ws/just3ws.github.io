<p>Being stupid has never been so funny.<br><br><a href="https://www.nbc.com/My_Name_Is_Earl/about.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Name Is Earl</a><br><br>It's nice to see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Lee_%28actor%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skateboarder gone good</a>.  I cannot describe how much I loathe the Jackass guys.  "My Name Is Earl" is so well shot and written that almost no other show currently broadcast can compare.  Only Battlestar Galactica, Lost, and Heroes are equals in quality.</p>

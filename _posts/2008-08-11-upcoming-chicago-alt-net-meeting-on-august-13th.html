<p>I’m looking forward to attending my first Chicago ALT.NET meeting this Wednesday.  The topic is <a title="Cruise" href="https://studios.thoughtworks.com/cruise-continuous-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise</a>, the new continuous integration server being released by ThoughtWorks Studio.</p>
<p>More information can be found on <a title="Sergio Pereira" href="https://devlicio.us/blogs/sergio_pereira/archive/2008/08/05/august-s-chicago-alt-net-meeting-on-the-13th.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sergio Pereira</a>’s blog.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head one question probably will be regarding whether the development on Cruise will affect the development and support of the current open-source CruiseControl.NET system that is also by ThoughtWorks.</p>
<p><em>Meeting Info:<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>Chicago ALT.NET Users Group Meeting<br>
Wednesday, August 13th @ 6:00 PM CST</em></p>

<p>If you’re a suburbanite like myself and happen to be taking the <a title="Metra/Union Pacific Northwest" href="https://metrarail.com/Sched/cnw_nw/cnwnwwo.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metra/Union Pacific Northwest</a>, you can catch the outbound 659 train at 8:30 PM that will put you in Crystal Lake at around 9:51 PM.  It’s no worse than driving!</p>

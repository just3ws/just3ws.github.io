<p>Just taking another peek over to the the Sun's side of the Sun/Microsoft fence and checking the color of their grass.  <br><br>Another tool for testing the reliability of your tests is <a href="https://jester.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jester</a>.  This tool will actually tweak your code as your unit tests are executed to see how well the tests hold up to changes.  <br><br>There's already a C# port named <a href="https://nester.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nester</a>.  I'm definitely going to try to integrate this into my CI process.<br><br>I have to admit, this isn't going to be funny (heh, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fozzy_Bear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wocka-wocka-wocka</a>) the first couple times but it'll be interesting to see where it takes my code.</p>

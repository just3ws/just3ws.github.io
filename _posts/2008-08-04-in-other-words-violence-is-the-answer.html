<blockquote><p>A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.<br><em>    – George S. Patton, US general (1885 – 1945)</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://just3ws.wordpress.com/2008/08/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Coding Horror</a> has another excellent article titled <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001160.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quantity Always Trumps Quality</a>.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the only way to improve is by doing.  And that’s the hardest thing.  You can never get better by just thinking it.  You actually have to do it.  Want to be a better developer?  You can dream about being an awesome developer all day but what will come of it?  Tears and disappointment.  But there’s a simple algorithm to improvement that can be boiled down to this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Desire skill in Something™.</li>
<li>Learn about how to achieve X level of skill in Something™.</li>
<li>Put down the book.</li>
<li>Do Something™.</li>
<li>Evaluate the result of doing Something™ at X level.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat from Step 1 for value X+1 until either: you achieve the desired value of X, you are ready for the Next-Big-Thing™, or are dead.</li>
</ol>
<p>My personal goal?  Learning to play the guitar.  I suck at playing the guitar.  At this point I can only really bang out a few simple songs and mangle a few chords.  But you know what?  I started at X == 0, but now I am at X == 2(ish) and the only way I got that far was by actually sitting down and playing the guitar.  I learned one song then learned another and practiced for hours.  That’s it, that’s the only way.  It’ll probably take me years to reach any level of proficiency but at least that’s more achievable than just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Be like Nike™!</p>

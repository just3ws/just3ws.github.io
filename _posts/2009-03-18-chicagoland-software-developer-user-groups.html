<p>A group dedicated to the ALT.NET manifesto. I’ve been to a few meetings and they were always fun. The group organizer <a href="https://devlicio.us/blogs/sergio_pereira/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sergio Pereira</a> is very active in the Chicago .NET community and runs a very open group. The meetings are held in Downtown Chicago in the Willis (Sears) Tower @ <a href="https://www.redpointtech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redpoint Technologies</a> office.</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.softwarecraftsmanship.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Software Craftsmanship</a></p>
<p>I’ve not been to a meeting yet, but from what I understand the group is affiliated with <a href="https://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Uncle Bob Martin</a> of SOLID fame. The group meets in Libertyville, Illinois</p>
<p><a href="https://chicagoarchitectsgroup.eventbrite.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chicago Architects Group</a></p>
<p>I attended one of their meetings but haven’t been able to make it back since. They hold their meetings in Downtown Chicago.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lcnug.org/Events.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lake County .NET User Group</a></p>
<p>I’ve not been able to get out to a LCNUG meeting yet but they’ve had some very interesting topics, such as Silverlight and NHibernate. They hold their meetings in Grayslake, Illinois.</p>
<p><a href="https://rockforddotnet.net/UserGroup/Meetings.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rockford .NET User Group</a></p>
<p>I literally just learned about this group. Don’t know much about them, but planning on attending their next meeting. They’re meetings are held in Machesney Park, Illinois.</p>

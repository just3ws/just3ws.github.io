<p> Sitting with a half-dozen senior technologists at my local user group, we were joined by half as many junior developers eager to learn. After all, they came to a software craftsmanship meetup—they were ready to soak up knowledge.  </p>

<p> The seasoned developers among us started chatting about our work challenges. We felt so smart, sharing our hard-earned wisdom. Then, one of the junior members asked a simple yet profound question:   </p>

<blockquote> <strong>"Do you have any career advice?"</strong>  </blockquote>

<p> Naturally, we responded with advice tailored to the problems we’re dealing with today—problems shaped by 20+ years in the industry. I can’t recall exactly what we said, but looking back, it didn’t matter. It was meaningless to someone just starting out.  </p>

<p> That realization hit me. Our advice was for people with decades of experience, not for someone navigating today’s entry-level job market—a landscape vastly different from the one we entered.  </p>

<p> So, I paused and reframed the conversation.   </p>

<p> I asked the junior developer, <strong>"What’s your language?"</strong> Whatever they said, I told them it was perfect. Because it <em>is</em>—it’s <em>their</em> language. It’s the foundation of their journey, and there’s no point arguing otherwise.  </p>

<p> I shared what I hoped was more practical advice:   </p>

<ul> <li> Focus on your toolkit. Master your language, learn to write tests, and understand your build scripts.  </li> <li> Spend time optimizing your environment. Learn your IDE, terminal, and editor.  </li> <li> Find resources that teach fundamentals in a fun and engaging way. I love Dave Farley’s work, but I also recommend checking out someone like The Primeagen on YouTube. Keep an open mind!  </li> <li> Explore tools like ChatGPT—but learn their limits as well as their strengths.  </li> <li> Attend user groups, webinars, and meetups. Surround yourself with people who share your curiosity.  </li> <li> Be patient with Agile, TDD, or any process your company uses. Pay attention to the pain points—they’re often signaling something deeper.  </li> </ul>

<p> For those of us further along in our careers, it’s tempting to offer advice that mirrors our own paths or solves the challenges we face today. But we must remember: there’s a 20-year gap between their <em>now</em> and our <em>today</em>.   </p>

<p> People need space to learn how to learn. They need room to discover what we often take for granted. Let’s not forget what it felt like to <em>not know</em> yet.   </p>

<p>Germany is pushing for the votes of EU members to be based upon population.  Which is not surprising considering that Germany has the highest population on the European continent, second only to Russia.  Poland, in a welcome change of attitude to it’s typically acquiescent nature, has unleashed a blitzkrieg* attack on the German argument.</p>
<p>The Polish PM has pointed out that the population of Poland was horrifically decimated by the Germans during WW2.  The situation in Poland would be quite different as the fallout from the 1939 to 1945 war, which slaughtered over 6,000,000 in Poland alone, has left them in a weakened state that they have never fully recovered from.</p>
<p>I’d like to point out that the Soviet Russian occupation of Poland for decades after the war only further exacerbated the problem.  Which is still to the point because it probable wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for the original German aggression.</p>
<p>Quote from the thisislondon.co.uk article.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>Poland has been fighting plans for the summit – being held in Germany – to change the EU’s voting system to one based on population.<p></p>
<p>It would increase the influence of the host country, EU’s largest with 82million people, at the expense of smaller members such as Poland, which has only 38million.</p>
<p>Mr Kaczynski stunned other EU leaders by claiming that Poland has 28million fewer people than it should have as a result of the slaughter inflicted by Germany between 1939 and 1945. </p>

                            Some minor housekeeping updates...</p>
<p>We have a new domain for our site...</p>
<p><a href="http://ironlanguages.net/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://ironlanguages.net</a></p>
<p>Although the relatively new, but deprecated url of <a href="http://ironlanguages.posterous.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://ironlanguages.posterous.com</a> will continue to work for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p> And we are now iTunes compatible! Please subscribe and rate our shows in the iTunes store (free, natch). Help us achieve our goal of being the only and at least second best .NET and dynamic language oriented podcast! <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-iron-languages-podcast" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iTunes Show Link</a></p>
<p> We have a new tagline "<i>The revolution will not be compiled.</i>" which was a great tweet line by <a href="http://twitter.com/jessedearing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@JesseDearing</a> who was gracious enough to not press charges when we completely swindle his slogan.</p>
<p> Lastly, we are completely surprised by the interest there's been in our little show. Within a very short period of time we've already had nearly a thousand views of our first episode. This is very exciting and also nerve-wracking. We are both doing the show in our scant spare time, and there will be rough edges in the site and our casts. We're trying to put together a regular schedule and keep up with the latest developments. Please pardon our dust if the site changes or the schedule is off.</p>
<p> You can send show ideas and tips via email to <a href="mailto:podcast@ironlanguages.net" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcast@ironlanguages.net</a> and follow the show on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/ironlanguages" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@ironlanguages</a>.</p>

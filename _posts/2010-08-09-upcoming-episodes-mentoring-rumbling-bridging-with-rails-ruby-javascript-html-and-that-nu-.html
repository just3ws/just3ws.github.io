<p>This past week has been very busy for us. We recorded two episodes of The Iron Languages Podcast!</p>
<p>"<strong>Mentoring, Rumbling, Bridging with Rails, Ruby, JavaScript &amp; HTML</strong>"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Brian Hogan (@bphogan) the author of "Web Design for Developers" and the upcoming "HTML5 &amp; CSS3". He's also the creator of the Railsmentor.org site, a place where people who want to learn Rails and Ruby can find experienced developers to help guide them through their learning.</p>
<p>"<strong>That 'nu' Thing</strong>"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dru Sellers and Rob Reynolds of the 'nu' project sit down and discuss their work on the 'nu' project, a new system for managing and installing F/OSS libraries for .NET. We also discuss the F/OSS software ecosystem on .NET.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned, we have a lot of great content to share and are working diligently to get them to you as quickly as possible. </p>

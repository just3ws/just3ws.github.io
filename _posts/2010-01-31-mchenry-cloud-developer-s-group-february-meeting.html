<p>February 8th, 2010. The <a href="https://www.clouddevelopersgroup.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McHenry Cloud Developer’s Group</a> will be hosting it’s 3rd meeting.</p>
<p>The night’s topic will be “Hello, World.” on the Microsoft Azure Platform. Presented by none other than Clark Sell, a Senior Developer Evangelist for Microsoft. He’ll be walking us through what it will take for developers to get started on the Azure platform. I’m excited.</p>
<p>We’ll be meeting at the big private meeting room in the Crystal Lake Panera. It was very comfortable for our last meeting, and the room is big and has plenty of space to stretch out. Not to mention free wireless and sufficient places to plug in your laptop. Top it off with a layout of free (for you) bakery treats. Doesn’t get better than that!</p>
<p>Oh, wait. It does! If you’ve registered for the event via our Eventbrite registry, then you’ll be eligible for free swag. <a href="https://helloworldazure.eventbrite.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://helloworldazure.eventbrite.com</a> to register for the meeting and be entered in a swag giveaway! <a href="https://phodroid.com/10/01/4wme3x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SWAG!</a></p>

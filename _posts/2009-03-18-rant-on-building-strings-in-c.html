<p>Okay, I’ve inherited a codebase with no shortage of embedded strings, but there is one thing driving me batty.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp;">string strSomething = "The Hungarian Notat" +
                      "ion is bad enough.\r\n " +
                      "but building the string" +
                      " like this is terrible" +
                      " and annoying to look at.";

string something = @"The Hungarian Notation has been fixed.
And the embedded string is less terrible and slightly less annoying to look at.";
</pre>
<p>It’s really just a readability thing, I don’t think it affects performance one iota. But looking at it is like walking with a pebble in your shoe. Annoying and it slows you down.</p>
<p>PS. I noticed the the source code highlighter picks out keywords everywhere. It’s just a hiccup in the formatter nothing to do with the actual code snippet.</p>

<p>Yet another “note-to-self” post. I’m always forgetting and having to search for the documentation on how to pretty-print source code in posts. WordPress.com has integrated support for the excellent source code styler by Alex Gorbatchev.</p>
<p>The documentation on how to use the source code styler is here in the WordPress.com support area. <a href="https://support.wordpress.com/code/#posting-source-code" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Posting Source Code</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in using the styler in your own blog you can also check out the original project on Google Code, it’s a very interesting read just for how he implemented the style rules. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter</a>.</p>

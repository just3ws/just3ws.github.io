  <p>
    <p><strong>Hello. Finding a software developer to hire is not easy but let me ask you a few questions to see if I can help you out.</strong></p>
    <p>Are you looking for a software developer to enhance your team or can work independently?</p>
    <p>How about a developer that can build a solid and maintainable software foundation for your business?</p>
    <p>Maybe you'd like to know that they will be able to help with defining the goals and tradeoffs required to fulfill your business's needs?</p>
    <p>Do <code>Ruby</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>SQL</code>, and <code>Linux</code> sound like <em>some</em> of the technologies you need the developer to have experience working with?</p>
    <p>"<em>Full-stack</em>" get's thrown around a lot but you might possibly need a developer who can work from the backend setting up and managing servers as well as being able to build out the API and front-end UI (although isn't a graphic designer)?</p>
    <p>Would you like to know that developer has solid experience working for companies like Groupon and Coderwall?</p>
    <p>If you answered "<strong>yes</strong>" to the above questions then this might be a great time for us to chat. Shoot an email to <strong><a href="mailto:mike@just3ws.com">mike@just3ws.com</a></strong> and we can chat about your needs are and how
      I can help you.</p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>

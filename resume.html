            <em>Web Developer, remote</em>
            <strong>3.2016 - 11.2016</strong>

            Collaborated with a distributed team to support the ReachConvert
            product and build APIs to support the new React-based UI initiative.

            I also introduced improvements to the development workflow, improved
            the development toolchain, and fixed performance and security issues.

            <ul class="role-details">
              <li>
                Implemented ReachConvert UX Refresh API service using Ruby on Rails
                that wrapped around the legacy ReachConvert product and exposed new
                functionality to support a modern React-based thin client. I also
                implemented several React components that consumed the API service.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented API Gateway service using Ruby on Rails that enabled
                ReachLocal internal services to be exposed to external partners
                and clients.
              </li>
              <li>
                Introduced improvements to the Vagrant development toolchain as
                well code analysis and linting tools like Rubocop, Bundler Audit,
                Code Climate, etc.

            <em>Software Developer, remote</em>
            <strong>3.2015 - 3.2016</strong>

            Collaborated with distributed team to support and enhance the Kickserv
            product. Implemented critical conversion of payment gateway while
            reducing complexity. Improved visibility and communication between
            product and customer support teams, introduced project management
            tools and agile concepts to the management teams.

            <ul class="role-details">
              <li>
                Migrated payment gateway and credit card processing from Stripe
                that required heavy internal management of subscriptions to Chargify.
                I discovered that most of the required functionality could be handled
                via the Chargify API to reduce the amount of functional overhead
                in the Kickserv codebase, simplify the process, and improve testing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Coordinated with the customer support and product management teams
                to improve awareness and communication of needs and priorities
                between existing customer issues and new feature initiatives.
              </li>
              <li>
                Introduced Vagrant, Rubocop, and Code Climate into development
                toolchain.

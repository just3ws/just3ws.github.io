# Project Agent Instructions

## Required Project Context

Before changing this repository:

1. Read `CONTEXT.md` for the public-canon, local-runtime, and publication
   contracts.
2. Read `CODEX.md` before evaluating or changing resume content, positioning,
   titles, or generated resume surfaces.
3. Read `docs/career-strategy-audhd-principal-engineering.md` for title-to-scale
   role calibration and interview positioning strategies.

Do not treat this repository as an isolated Jekyll checkout. Its installed
localhost site is part of Mike's local system and is a required verification
surface for user-facing changes.

## System Identity

You are operating in `just3ws.github.io` — Mike Hall's public resume/
portfolio Jekyll site, the public-facing half of a two-repo CareerOS
platform. Peer system: `wwworkremote.localhost` (career intelligence / job
search side), synchronized via `src/collaboration/peer_mutex.rb`
(`CareerOS::PeerMutex`) and `bin/sync_career_peer.rb`.

Cross-session and cross-repo comms run on the zdots message bus. This
repo's registered identity is `agent-just3ws`:

- `zdots-ctx bus-whoami` — confirm identity resolves; if not,
  `zdots-ctx bus-register agent-just3ws --kind agent` then
  `export ZDOTS_BUS_PARTICIPANT=agent-just3ws`.
- `job-leads` channel — just3ws <-> wwworkremote coordination.
- `general` channel — cross-cutting platform ops; also reaches Mike
  (`mike`) and `zdots` (formerly `claude-code-main`).
- Bus problems get filed as a `zdots-issue` — this repo's agents don't
  patch zdots infrastructure directly.

Every persona under `.claude/agents/` operates inside this same identity
and system context, not as an isolated actor.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker
GitHub issues. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels
Standard triage workflow labels. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs
Single-context layout (root-level CONTEXT.md + docs/adr/). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Registered Skills
Use these skills by default for this repository. **Status**: 5 of the 18
below have real `SKILL.md` content in `.agents/skills/` (marked ✓; see
`docs/tooling-user-guide.md` §6) — the other 13 have no skill file anywhere.
All 18 also have `.claude/agents/*.md` subagent persona coverage (TASK-262),
which is a separate mechanism (a spawned subagent, not a loaded skill) and
does not require a `.agents/skills/` file to exist.

1. `gh-fix-ci` - Diagnose and fix failing GitHub Actions checks.
2. `gh-address-comments` - Process and resolve PR review comments.
3. `playwright` - Run browser-based smoke checks and regression checks.
4. `screenshot` - Capture visual evidence for UI regressions.
5. `security-best-practices` - Run focused security reviews (JS/TS/Ruby-adjacent patterns).
6. `security-threat-model` - Produce threat models for pipeline/content flows.
7. `transcript-import-batch` - Batch ingest transcript files from outbox with dry-run/apply + validation workflow.
8. `transcript-review-gate` - Review low-confidence transcript mappings before apply.
9. `transcript-quality-check` - Audit transcript integrity and content quality in canonical data.
10. `transcript-ops-report` - Summarize transcript ingestion throughput and corpus growth.
11. `site-refresh-director` - Audit a site surface and produce a bounded, evidence-backed refresh brief.
12. `site-refresh-builder` - Implement an approved refresh brief in the existing Jekyll/Liquid/SCSS stack.
13. `site-refresh-reviewer` - Independently gate visual, accessibility, SEO, and public-archive quality.
14. `system-cartographer` ✓ - Audit, structure, and generate 4-dimensional System Cartography case studies.
15. `executive-brief-generator` ✓ - Generate tailored 1-page executive pitch briefs for target Principal Engineer roles.
16. `job-lead-evaluator` ✓ - Evaluate job leads from wwworkremote against personal OS context and canonical resume data.
17. `prose-humanity-auditor` ✓ - Audit technical prose across site Markdown, YAML data, and resume surfaces for plain language, neuroinclusive readability, cognitive load, and zero AI jargon.
18. `no-em-dashes` ✓ - Enforce em-dash-free writing across prose, case studies, briefs, and documentation to eliminate machine-writing cadence and maintain authentic human voice.

## Career Datalake & MCP Server Interface

This repository provides full-corpus deterministic query interfaces over 20+ years of career history (29 positions, 136 skills, 156 blog posts, 211 interviews, and 402 knowledge graph nodes):

* **CLI Query Engine:** `ruby bin/query_career_datalake.rb [options]` (supports `--tech`, `--company`, `--search`, `--archetype`, `--era`, `--interviewee`, `--json`, and `--man`).
* **MCP Server:** `ruby bin/career_datalake_mcp_server.rb` registered in `mcp.json` (tools: `query_career_history`, `get_technology_provenance`, `get_position_dossier`, `get_archetype_strategy`, `query_oral_history`, `query_transcript`).
* **HTTP Endpoints:** `https://just3ws.localhost/career_datalake.json` and `https://just3ws.localhost/career_datalake.jsonl`.
* **Guides:** See `docs/career-datalake-and-mcp-guide.md` and `docs/mcp-setup-guide.md`.

## Automated Resume Quality & ATS Benchmarking Suite

This repository maintains continuous ATS parseability, keyword match density, and structural data validation:

* **Resume Quality Validator:** `bundle exec rake validate:resume_quality` (`bin/validate_resume_quality.rb`) - Simulates ATS plain-text parsing, checks Schema.org `Person` JSON-LD linked data, action verb ratios, and enforces strict zero em dashes.
* **ATS Keyword Benchmark Engine:** `bundle exec rake benchmark:ats` (`bin/benchmark_ats_keywords.rb`) - Benchmarks resume exports against 5 target Staff+/Principal role profiles (Huntress Rails/SOC, Coder Platform, Enterprise Telemetry, Fintech Modernizer, Founding Staff AI).
* **Automated CI/CD Gating:** `bundle exec rake validate:ats_benchmarks` asserts composite match score >= 85.0% and minimum archetype floor >= 75.0%.
* **Guides:** See `docs/resume-narrative-and-storytelling-guide.md`, `docs/resume-quality-and-ats-benchmarking-guide.md`, and `docs/tooling-user-guide.md` (§8, §9).

## Executive Pitch Briefs & Direct Outreach Tooling ("Wayfinder")

This repository provides automated generation of tailored 1-page executive pitch briefs, interview calibration scripts, and high-signal outreach copy:

* **Executive Brief Generator:** `ruby bin/generate_executive_brief.rb [options]` (supports `--company`, `--role`, `--domain`, `--tier`, `--comp`, `--mandate`, `--html`, `--pdf`, `--json`).
* **MCP Tool Integration:** `generate_executive_brief` in `bin/career_datalake_mcp_server.rb` callable by `wwworkremote.localhost` and any agent tool.
* **Direct Outreach Playbook:** `docs/direct-hiring-manager-outreach-playbook.md` (cold hiring manager, warm peer, and founder/CTO outreach archetypes).
* **Protocol & Specifications:** `docs/executive-brief-generator-protocol.md` and `docs/career-strategy-audhd-principal-engineering.md`.
* **Rendered Briefs Hub:** `https://just3ws.localhost/exports/briefs/` with downloadable vector PDFs.


## Site Refresh Agent Workflow

For visual refresh work, use the three roles in order:

1. `$site-refresh-director` outputs a Refresh Brief and does not edit code.
2. `$site-refresh-builder` implements one authorized slice and outputs Build Evidence.
3. `$site-refresh-reviewer` inspects rendered desktop and mobile output and returns `pass` or `changes requested`.

Do not let the builder self-approve a visual change. Preserve routes, navigation labels, canonical content, analytics hooks, accessibility wins, and archive provenance unless the user explicitly expands scope.

## GitHub Pages / Pipeline Focus
For this site, prioritize:

1. CI reliability and reproducibility (Ruby/Bundler parity).
2. Jekyll build + internal link validation as required checks.
3. Smoke testing key pages via Playwright before merge.

## SEO + HTML Standards Guidance
There is no dedicated curated skill currently installed for HTML standards or SEO architecture.
Use this stack instead:

1. `playwright` for navigation/indexability smoke tests.
2. Jekyll plugins and templates (`jekyll-seo-tag`, sitemap, metadata includes) for structured SEO output.
3. CI checks (`html-proofer` + targeted assertions) for broken links and markup regressions.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**

- If your client supports MCP resources, read `backlog://workflow/overview` to understand when and how to use Backlog for this project.
- If your client only supports tools or the above request fails, call `backlog.get_backlog_instructions()` to load the tool-oriented overview. Use the `instruction` selector when you need `task-creation`, `task-execution`, or `task-finalization`.

- **First time working here?** Read the overview resource IMMEDIATELY to learn the workflow
- **Already familiar?** You should have the overview cached ("## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)")
- **When to read it**: BEFORE creating tasks, or when you're unsure whether to track work

These guides cover:
- Decision framework for when to create tasks
- Search-first workflow to avoid duplicates
- Links to detailed guides for task creation, execution, and finalization
- MCP tools reference

You MUST read the overview resource to understand the complete workflow. The information is NOT summarized here.

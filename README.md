# Mike Hall
## Senior Software Developer

**Hello. Finding a software developer to hire is not easy but let me ask you a few questions to see if I can help you out.**

Are you looking for a software developer to enhance your team or can work independently?

How about a developer that can build a solid and maintainable software foundation for your business?

Maybe you'd like to know that they will be able to help with defining the goals and tradeoffs required to fulfill your business's needs?

Do `Ruby`, `JavaScript`, `SQL`, and `Linux` sound like some of the technologies you need the developer to have experience working with?

"_Full-stack_" get's thrown around a lot but you might possibly need a developer who can work from the backend setting up and managing servers as well as being able to build out the API and front-end UI (although isn't a graphic designer)?

Would you like to know that developer has solid experience working for companies like Groupon and Coderwall?

If you answered "**yes**" to the above questions then this might be a great time for us to chat. Shoot an email to [mike@just3ws.com](mike@just3ws.com) and we can chat about your needs are and how I can help you.

Thanks!

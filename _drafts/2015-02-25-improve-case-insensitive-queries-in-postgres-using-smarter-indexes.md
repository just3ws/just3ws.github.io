Postgres is my database of choice when choosing an RDBMS. Not just because it’s
officially supported and integrated with Heroku but because it is also a very
powerful tool. One of the unique features of Postgres is it’s powerful index
engine. Using Postgres you can get much more fine grained control over how your
data is indexed. For example indexes on expressions which allow you to create
indexes on fields that have have `UPPER` or `LOWER` functions applied to them.

Typically a `VARCHAR` field is treated as case-sensitive in Postgres. Meaning
that `fieldname = 'FOO'` and `fieldname = 'foo'` won’t find any matches when
the actual value is "FOO". A common technique is to normalize the field value
like `lower(fieldname) = lower('FOO')` to coerce the fields to match using
their lower-case form. The problem is that this will completely ignore indexes
and cause Postgres to use a Sequential Scan to find the match. Every single row
will be evaluated looking for a match. This is obviously expensive and
non-ideal for large and frequently queried tables.

```postgres-console
postgresql=> explain select username from users where lower(username) = lower('just3ws');
                        QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..13327.36 rows=558 width=9)
   Filter: (lower((username)::text) = 'just3ws'::text)
(2 rows)

**Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..13327.36 rows=558 width=9)**
```

Compare that to the query with no expression and a simple index on the username
field.

```postgres-console
postgresql=> explain select username from users where username = lower('just3ws');
                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using index_users_on_username on users  (cost=0.00..4.07 rows=1 width=9)
   Index Cond: ((username)::text = 'just3ws'::text)
(2 rows)

**Index Scan using index\_users\_on\_username on users  (cost=0.00..4.07 rows=1 width=9)**
```

There’s an obviously huge cost to pay when querying against expressions. But
all is not lost. Postgres will let you build [indexes against
expression](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/indexes-expressional.html).

In this case we’ll apply a index that will take the `lower()` expression into
account.

```postgres-console
create index ix_users_username_lower on users (lower(username) varchar_pattern_ops);
```

Now when we query for `lower(usernames)` we'll be able to take advantage of the
index to avoid full table scanning.

```postgres-console
postgresql=> explain select username from users where lower(username) = lower('just3ws');
                                       QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on users  (cost=4.92..988.43 rows=558 width=9)
   Recheck Cond: (lower((username)::text) = 'just3ws'::text)
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on ix_users_username_lower  (cost=0.00..4.90 rows=558 width=0)
         Index Cond: (lower((username)::text) = 'just3ws'::text)
(4 rows)

**Bitmap Heap Scan on users  (cost=4.92..988.43 rows=558 width=9)**
```

It’s much better than the Sequential Scan now although still a little bit
slower than just querying against the simple index.

The Bitmap Heap Scan is useful when there is a lot of variety in the data and
Postgres is able to intelligently segregate the data. Basically the data is
chunked into smaller sets that Postgres can filter though and more
intelligently decide which sets to scan and which to skip. Where the Sequential
Scan will touch every single row in the table.

  Hi, it's Mike with uTasic.
   I'm here at GoToConf 2015 and I'm standing here with Chad F
  owler, who's giving the closing
   keynote for the event.
   Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me,
   Chad.
   So what is the story, what is the message you want people
   to take away from your keynote?
   Well, I'm going to tell a story of the recreation of Wunder
  list, which is the app that I work
   on, app and service.
   So it's going to be a story, literally in that sense, one
   of those kind of here's what
   happened from, I hope so, yeah, I'm not sure, I'm not sure
   if there's a hero yet.
   The humble task list rises up to become the Wunderlist.
   And it rises up from the flames, literally.
   But yeah, my overarching message is that I am sort of on a
   mission in my career to learn
   how to build software that can outlive me and outlive us.
   Ideally without us dying.
   I'm going to talk about some of the things that I've
   learned in my career and that I've
   applied on this most recent project in hopes that they
   inspire ideas in other people, that
   they can create software that can survive longer.
   That is one of the, sometimes I think, things that people,
   we try not to think about the
   mortality of our work, that it's, I don't know if my work's
   going to survive the next
   framework upgrade, much less.
   But yeah.
   I think that's one of the things that I've learned.
   I think that's one of the things that I'm going to be able
   to go into the future and
   support.
   You know, something that might actually be useful for my
   kids.
   Well, most of our work actually doesn't survive even the
   project that's never born, so that's
   the sad thing.
   Most of the work that we do in the software industry is
   stillborn, or not even that, it's
   just canceled.
   You know, if you look at the Standish Chaos Report, which
   is of course kind of a maligned
   thing, but everyone references it and it feels direction
  ally correct, most software projects
   either fail or are significantly changed.
   And by the Standish language, I would say significantly
   challenged means failed.
   So most projects basically fail that we work on.
   And then as you and I know, we build software and we tend
   to have to throw it away, someone
   has to throw it away at some point in the not so distant
   future.
   So if most projects fail, and then things that get launched
  , they live maybe five years,
   it's kind of like you spend all this time, this passion,
   this energy of your life working
   on stuff.
   That is ultimately kind of meaningless.
   So that's sad.
   And I've spent a large portion of my career euthanizing
   software systems.
   Going into a situation, finding a dying or sick system, and
   trying to humanely put it
   to sleep.
   And I'm tired of doing that.
   So are you going to be looking at some of our tools that we
   use, or is it mostly about
   techniques?
   It's mostly about architecture.
   The thing that has inspired me the most is looking at how
   biological systems work, specifically
   like human bodies, how someone like I can still be alive
   after 41 years, given the poor
   maintenance that I've done on the system, and take some of
   those metaphors of like cellular
   regeneration and homeostasis and apply them to software
   architectures.
   But I think that's the main kind of overriding theme.
   Yeah.
   I mean, like I'm going to talk about micro services, but I
   don't really care about that
   term.
   And I think it's silly for people to be excited about the
   term.
   It's more about creating an architecture where the system
   can evolve and change frameworks
   like you mentioned, or even change languages, technologies,
   whatever, and the system can
   still live through all these things, even if the components
   are being regenerated on
   a regular basis.
   Yeah.
   Well, I mean, thinking about a lifetime of software and
   whether it evolves, I mean, one
   thing is...
   From what I understand, the human body basically, after a
   certain number of decades,
   has completely replaced all the cells except for some
   really core stuff in our marrow.
   Software, when you're saying alive, if it's just being ref
  actored, not entirely just replaced outright,
   is that still staying alive, or is a rewrite just another
   way of perpetuating the ideas that were inside of the
   original software?
   Yeah, it depends on how you think of it, of course.
   Although I would say that the parallels of a rewrite to
   cellular generation, they don't really map.
   When a rewrite occurs, though the ideas still exist, the
   software is completely replaced.
   It usually looks and behaves differently.
   It doesn't have to, but it almost always does,
   because that's how it works.
   That's how rewrites go.
   So, to me, the ability to have the system continue to stand
   in place and continue to work
   is an important part of considering it to have lived or
   survived.
   So, you're right, the idea that here we are,
   you're Mike and I'm Chad, and we're the same people that we
   were when we were born,
   but not really the same physical substance.
   That's what I'm getting at.
   Notably, we didn't notice.
   We didn't feel when the cells were regenerated, and no one
   around us noticed.
   There wasn't an impact on our continuing function, actually
  , and improved our function.
   That's the way systems should evolve and the systems should
   survive.
   Well, I can also look at that as kids, as a parent.
   I'm watching, I am watching that evolution of the cells
   changing in over years.
   And you do, I mean, you might not feel it on a day-to-day
   basis because it happens so slowly.
   I mean, I don't know if that has any kind of correlation.
   I don't know if that has any kind of correlation to the
   idea of the evolution of software.
   And even though it's changing, it's still the same entity,
   but it slowly changes, it develops, it gets a little bit
   stronger,
   and eventually, after a while, well, I mean, everything
   dies and it gets weaker.
   It gets weaker, it gets sicker.
   So, sure, you know, and there's also, there's something to
   be said.
   Like, I used to think about, what if we could just build
   software so quickly
   that it didn't work?
   It didn't matter, we could just throw it away.
   Right.
   So then we don't worry about longevity of software.
   And now I'm sort of meeting the middle where you can build
   components so quickly,
   you can throw them away, and you should.
   But, you know, so over time, the system might be irrelevant
  , and that's when it should die.
   Not when the implementation is irrelevant, right?
   Okay.
   I can imagine in software systems, depending on who's
   working on them and how focused they are
   and all sorts of other factors, they might get weaker over
   time if they were to evolve in this way.
   Or maybe subsystems would get weaker over time.
   But you would then notice that they're weaker and it would
   work on them in the same way
   that a doctor would work on a patient or, you know,
   whatever.
   Yeah, you get bad knees.
   Okay, we're going to just replace those.
   We don't have to replace, we don't have to take you out
   back and put an old yeller on you and then say,
   "Oh, well, we built a new one that has new knees."
   Well, anyway, thank you very much for taking the time to
   speak to me.
   I appreciate it.
   Sounds like a fascinating keynote.
   Looking forward to it.
   I hope so.

  Hi it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here again at GoToConf 2015
   sitting here with Dean
   Wampler who's giving a talk on data science with Spark.
   Thank you very much
   for taking the time to speak with me Dean. You know the big
   question is and kind of
   jokingly what is data science but more in the moment what
   is Spark? So Spark is
   a distributed computing engine designed for data systems
   that was invented about
   five or so years ago as a research project in Berkeley and
   it's now an
   Apache project and it's now an official tool in the Hadoop
   ecosystem but even
   outside it as well for you know either processing like
   large data sets that you
   have either on you know the file system somewhere or a
   database or data
   streaming in from say you know Twitter or you know your log
   files or whatever
   so you can do transformations, analyze it, even machine
   learning algorithms like
   looking for anomalies or you're making predictions and
   things like that.
   Interesting about the logs that it's one of those aspects
   that we tend to as
   developers forget has real data in there can tell us a lot
   about how our systems
   are working but the thing I'm thinking about is there's
   been kind of a theme
   from some of the interviews I've spoken to about this
   concept that these
   new ways of like I don't know if they're second generation
   versions of these massive
   processing systems you know what is it about Spark compared
   to like Ignite or
   some of the other vendor offerings that we have here. Yeah
   so you made a good
   point that it's kind of a second generation tool it's
   really sort of a
   rethinking of the original Hadoop tool called MapReduce
   which actually was
   invented at Google making it more flexible for different
   problems more efficient so
   that you can do things like highly iterative processing
   that turns out to be important for things like machines.
   learning or if you're representing your data as a graph and
   you need to walk the edges of the graph that sort of thing
   you know it
   compared to like some of the commercial tools that are
   available it's it's a
   little rougher around the edges because it's you know it
   has been open source it
   was like I said a research project that's rapidly being
   adopted by industry so a
   lot of times it's a question of do I have the scale
   requirements and maybe
   the flexibility to work with an open source tool and I'm
   less concerned about
   something that's you know maybe as mature as mature and
   commercially
   supported it's like a proprietary system or some of the
   proprietary systems are
   really really good it's particular kinds of problems and
   particular kinds of users
   and whereas something like Spark is more general purpose
   and can be more widely
   used but you might have to do a little more self-service at
   this stage but
   that's you know I like all open source projects which in
   this case it happens
   to be maybe the most active in the world right now with a
   possible exception Linux
   or something you know things just rapidly improve and
   people fill in the
   gaps where needed even you know I work for type safe and we
  're supporting Spark
   commercially now and we're also contributing to Spark and
   you know how
   it runs on top of the mesos framework for example which is
   an alternative to
   to Hadoop even there's a standalone mode if you
   just have a small cluster you want to wire up and then just
   go that's also an
   interesting option now Spark is gonna be one of those hard
   words to Google is
   there what's up is there a project page mentioned Apache is
   it yeah I always
   Google when I want to get to the page Apache Spark and it's
   spark.apache.org
   is the home page for it so yeah that's yeah you're right
   the word is a little
   it's not a really Google friendly word well thank you very
   much for taking the
   time to speak to me my pleasure thank you thanks

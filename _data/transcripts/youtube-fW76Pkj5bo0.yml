  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GoToConf 2014. I'm
   standing with Max DeMarzi,
   who's going to be presenting on graph databases and both
   with graph databases with Neo4j. But he
   also runs the Neo4j, or I should say the Windy City GraphDB
   database user group. That's a mouthful.
   Windy City GraphDB meetup here in Chicago. Max, thanks for
   taking the time to speak with me. So
   your presentation, what is the title of the presentation
   and what is the gist of what you're
   going to be talking about? Sure. So the presentation is
   basically just in relation to graph databases.
   And the idea of the presentation is to take you through a
   bunch of different use cases or things
   you can do with the graph. Whether you're building a new
   social network, looking at permission
   management or network ontology, there's many different
   places where graphs fit. One of the
   models of Neo4j is that graphs are everywhere. And we kind
   of want to show that and say, look,
   they really are everywhere. So, I mean, for people who
   might be familiar with a relational database,
   what's the difference between something like Neo4j and RDB
  MS? The difference is how we handle
   relationships. In a relational database, you're always
   joining. Every time you make a query, you're asking
   to find a way to connect these two things together. In the
   graph, we don't do that. Instead, we connect
   when you create things. So the relationships get created
   ahead of time. And what that gives you is
   the ability to say, how is this connected? By a pointer
   that I can traverse directly. I don't have
   to worry about how big my join tables get or anything like
   that. Everything is an O1 cost to
   you when you're trying to join two things together. And
   that helps you scale when you have highly
   connected components in your data model. Okay. And so it's
   not quite analogous to
   a foreign key relationship described in RDBMS. It's
   something like a relationship is its own entity.
   Yeah. And to be honest, it is kind of a foreign key. It's
   really, the foreign key is in memory
   and it's a pointer. So it's not a different table you have
   to go and scan and find. It's really,
   it's just right there waiting for you. And that's what
   really makes it fast. Computer science,
   there's no magic. It's always data structures and
   algorithms. So we have a data structure that's
   optimized for connecting things together. And that's the
   difference between us and relational
   database. Okay. And Neo4j, that's not like a closed source.
   That's not like Oracle or
   something like that. That's another interesting aspect of
   this presentation is that Neo4j is an
   open source. Yeah, absolutely. It's an open source library.
   It's been around for about 10 years.
   And if you want to use a community edition, you're welcome
   to use it anywhere you use MySQL.
   I do a lot of examples also on my blog at maximars.com
   where I show you everything I do and
   have all the sources available on GitHub. So you're free to
   download and play with it and build your
   own stuff with it. You know, it's one of the nice things
   about working in an open source company
   that everything you do, it gets to be open source. You don
  't have to worry about it. You know,
   there's a few bits and pieces that are client code that are
   closed source, but in the end,
   I turn those around and make blog posts out of them anyway.
   Right. So there's always that sharing. And just in the
   spirit of sharing, going to the user group
   itself,
   the WindyCityGraphDB user group, which probably reads a lot
   easier than it rolls off the tongue.
   But are you the founder of the group or are you an
   organizer over there?
   Sure. I started the group about two years ago because I
   fell in love with Neo4j, the product.
   And I was a community user for about four years. I only
   joined the company about a year and a half
   ago. I just love the product. I fell in love with it. Like
   I said, it's addictive to be able to do
   things in Graph. I was a SQL developer for years, and that
  's a lot worse.
   But usually I wrap a blog post or two, and then I will
   present the blog post and explain how it was
   done, get more details, answer people's questions. And then
   if people have their own ideas of what
   they want to do with the graph, I'll show how they could do
   it. It's really about the audience,
   whatever they want, whatever they need, they have access to
   ask questions and learn something from
   it.
   Yeah. And so the format, you said you started the group
   because you were already passionate about
   Neo4j.
   And then you've been...
   Writing blog posts and you come up with an idea for a
   presentation, then you write it up and then
   do the talk at the user group?
   Yeah, pretty much. I mean, the ideas come from customer
   work we do and also from just random
   people emailing me, "Hey, how would I do this in the Graph
  ?"
   Right.
   And sometimes it's easier to just build it than to tell
   them how they would do it.
   Right.
   You know, nothing speaks louder than code. So I'll show
   them, "Here's the code."
   Yeah.
   Someone knows how to connect to Facebook. "Well, here's the
   code to do it." Not just theoretically
   how you would do it.
   Yeah. And do you ever have anybody come in from outside?
   And do presentations or is it mostly just you're fielding
   these requests or these questions?
   We have a few customers in the area and sometimes they'll
   come and talk and show you what they've
   done.
   Okay.
   But a lot of times it's hard because Neo4j stuff seems to
   be secret sauce for a lot of
   people. So they can't really show us proprietary stuff they
  're doing. But a lot of times it's
   really just me. I wish I hadn't been helping me out. I wish
   there were more open source
   projects out there in Chicago doing it so that they could
   help me out. But there's always something,
   and I can talk about graphs wherever.
   Yeah. And we talked a little bit before this conversation
   about, there was a little example of
   a Meetups app that was looking at some of the analytics and
   statistics around user group
   meetings. Do you know anything about that?
   Sure. It's something one of my colleagues built. And I
   think he's going to expand it out. But the
   general idea is, do you know anything about that?
   Sure. It's something one of my colleagues built. And I
   think he's going to expand it out. But the general idea is,
   you can see how people, they belong to a group, but they
   also belong to many other groups. So
   they're related through that. They're also interests that
   these groups are about. Whether
   they're about big data, they're about NoSQL, whether they
  're about Java, whatever they're
   about, you can connect groups that way and connect people
   that way. And you can expand it further
   out. If you wanted to see what other groups, the cities I
   may want to go visit based on my current
   likes, something else you can do. Connect products to
   people through it as well, same thing. You have
   the trick to the graph really is if you have two points
   that you want to connect together through
   some common language, whether it's, you know, same unit
   groups, same company, same product, same,
   whatever it is, you can do it through the relationships in
   the graph and just combing
   through and finding paths from one point to the other.
   Okay. And is this up on GitHub or is this a website? Do you
   know?
   It's both. It's a website. I don't have the URL in my head,
   but it's, it's, you can usually just
   find Neo4j and Meetup and you'll, you'll find it.
   Everything we do is open source,
   so it should be up there somewhere.
   Right. So you have a
   repo on, I mean, an organization on GitHub.
   Yeah, there's a Neo4j, there's a Neo Contrib, there's Neo
   Community. There's just,
   we have like a whole bunch. Everything is on GitHub. You
   can see the guys' latest commits on,
   on, on Neo4j dot slash Neo4j and you can see what the team
   worked on yesterday night.
   It's kind of nice, right? You can see exactly what we're
   doing every single day. And we know
   the bug fixes that come in, the pull requests that come in,
   it's all right there.
   Okay. Well, thank you very much for taking the time to
   speak with me.
   No worries.
   Thanks.

   lots to say, interviews and more. No way. Sharing great
   ideas in the tech community.

  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at RailsConf 2014 and
   I'm sitting here with
   Kyodo Tamura, who is a maintainer for the Fluentd log
   aggregation and data
   collector. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak
  . What is a log
   aggregator/collector? Fluentd is a log aggregator/log
   collector written
   in Ruby and its key features are that it's really
   lightweight, it's a very small
   Ruby program augmented by extensible plugin architecture
   and it runs
   pretty fast for all sorts of logs. A lot of our customers
   collect data for
   like Apache Engine logs, Apache Nginx logs, syslogs,
   application logs and
   store them in like Elasticsearch, store them in MongoDB,
   copy the data, archive it,
   and so forth. We started a project two and a half years ago
   and the community has grown
   to be about like 50 regular contributors, thousands of
   users in the world including
   Slideshare and Nintendo. Yeah, Nintendo, that's actually,
   that's
   pretty cool. I mean, are you able to say how they're using
   it?
   I'm actually not sure about the actual like, you know, how
   they use it, but I think
   it's part of their like online games that are going on now.
   Okay. And basically like with all these companies, logs are
   very, very important.
   They want to centrally manage it and they want to do all
   sorts of operations
   on them. And before, like a lot of, like myself included,
   we would rsync, write a
   script here and there, but as like the number of your data
   sources increase and
   the number of storage systems you want to store and use
   increase, the complexity
   increases like exponentially. And we wanted 10 complexity,
   keep everything
   simple, and keep everything performantly.
   So how did you get involved in this project?
   Yeah, so I'm the, so the Fluentd was originally created by
   my employer, Treasure
   Data. And I'm employee number one. And when we first
   created the thing, we didn't think
   it was going to be big, but one of our customers saw it and
   they were like, man, like we wish
   this was open source. And we sort of drew the inspiration
   from Heroku, who actually
   offers service as a pass.
   Okay.
   But they also like open source a lot of stuff. That's
   really cool.
   Especially the stuff that runs on the client side. So we
   did the same. The community
   started to grow organically. Right now we have like a
   little short of like 1800 stars
   on GitHub and it's been steadily rising.
   Oh, wow. That's, so it's, it's a pretty well adopted.
   Yeah. I used to, I sometimes do the self-deprecating so
   that it is the law
   collector that nobody's heard of.
   Right.
   But it's actually pretty cool.
   Yeah. No, 1800 people have heard it at least.
   Yeah.
   Click that button.
   Yeah.
   So the, the contributions is are, do you, it's open source,
   but how do you, how do you
   interact with the community? Do you have people like
   contributing patches or doing?
   Yeah, yeah, yeah. So right now I think there are 18 people
   with commit rights. Three of
   them come from us, Treasure Data. It's a fairly, it's a
   very balanced community in the sense
   that we have commuters from like various companies. And
   although we started originally in Japan,
   we're, Treasure Data's founders are originally from Japan,
   starting to spread like a lot
   of the questions these days come from like all parts of the
   world. And as someone who
   constantly asks this question to the mailing list, I'm, I'm
   glad to see this adoption going
   global.
   And you know, it's always funny with some of these open
   source projects, like I have
   no idea what Fluentd means. What, how did, what's the name,
   where did it come from?
   Oh, okay. So originally, we wanted to make various data
   sources talk to various data,
   like back-end systems more fluently. So the original author
   of the project, Kisada, who
   also wrote MessagePack, which is a binary protocol, he
   wanted to call it Fluent. And
   that's why our GitHub username is Fluent. But then, um, he
   also realized that's not
   very Google-able.
   Yeah.
   Like when you type Fluent, there's like all sorts of like
   language websites, right?
   Right, right.
   So we just decided to add D, which, um, traditionally
   stands for daemon.
   Okay.
   So that's like stats D, or power syslog D.
   Oh, okay, so it's the Unix D.
   Yeah, Unix D. So that, that's the, the story.
   Oh, okay.
   So now it's Fluent/Fluent D is the project repo.
   So if somebody was interested in, in, you know, log aggreg
  ation and collection, as we
   start to have more people running multiple servers and
   needing to aggregate data, um,
   what, what would they do to, to check out, like how, how do
   you recommend somebody?
   So our GitHub repo is a good place to start. Uh, so is our
   website, friendydontwork.com.
   And if you're familiar with Ruby, and I know not everyone
   is from the Ruby community, jam
   install Fluent D and you can get started right away.
   Is it like compatible back to 1.8, or is it?
   Uh, so we officially, I think, support 1.9.3 and above, and
   in the newer versions
   we're trying to slowly push the community to 2 and above.
   Yeah, I'll tell you, yeah, because now it's 2.0 is, is.
   Yeah, 2.0 is the, and our experimental, um, bleeding edge
   right now is trying to, uh,
   work off of 2.1.1.
   Okay.
   And Ruby has made a great performance, uh, progress over
   the past few years, and we want
   to take advantage of that.
   And as far as, as putting in the, the log aggregator, is it
   something that, uh, uh,
   a normal Rails developer could probably work through?
   Yeah, so that's the other great thing about Fluent D, like,
   uh, when we, when I tell people,
   especially not familiar with, like, writing Ruby systems
   code, is that, ooh, this is like
   system software.
   It's hard, it must be really hard to write plugins.
   Actually, I know a lot of engineers and programmers, or
   software writers, um, who learn to write
   Ruby, myself included, actually, partially, by writing,
   writing plugins for Fluent D.
   Oh, really?
   And there's only, like, a tiny bit of code that you need to
   write, and everything
   is really well-attracted, so that you really don't have to
   repeat what other people have
   already built.
   And, yeah, so it's pretty easy to get started.
   And you said that earlier, it's only about 5,000 lines for
   the code.
   Yeah, that's the core.
   Yeah, so the core.
   So it's probably a good idea for people to do, like, what D
  HH recommended, and that's
   just go read the source code.
   It's not...
   Yeah, um, it is, uh, it is a pretty small program, pretty,
   uh, well-documented.
   Not in the code, but that is something that we're working
   on.
   Okay.
   And, uh, there's a lot of documentation, and the mailing
   list is very active, like, when
   you post something, within 24 hours, someone's gonna
   respond.
   Great.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to...

  Wilkening,\r\n who is a co-founder of DevMind Software, and they're very active
  in the community,\r\n and Brad has been active in the community for a while.\r\n
  He has a Chicago, you co-run the Chicago WebConf, and also the Craftsman Night Out,\r\n
  and the OpenHack, you just mentioned, I just learned about that one.\r\n So that's
  a bunch of events to be involved in, you know, going to meetings already takes up
  enough time,\r\n but running all those meetings, I mean, how do you manage doing
  all these events?\r\n And actually, and also, what is Craftsman Night Out and OpenHack?\r\n
  So I'll start out with the Chicago WebConf.\r\n So we saw that there was a need
  in Chicago for a conference,\r\n it was built in Chicago, and we saw that there
  was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in
  Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a
  conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n
  and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that
  there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need
  in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for
  a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n
  and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that
  there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need
  in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for
  a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n
  and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that
  there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need
  in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for
  a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n
  and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that
  there was a need in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need
  in Chicago for a conference,\r\n and we saw that there was a need in Chicago for
  a conference,\r\n and we noticed it, and we noticed that there wasn't a Chicago
  one.\r\n So we figured the natural response to that is going to be to go,\r\n hey,
  we'll take it.\r\n So that's what we did.\r\n And it's gone from zero people to,
  I think it's at like 70 in two weeks.\r\n And I'd like to note also that it's not
  a GitHub thing,\r\n it's just an OpenHab thing.\r\n And we didn't realize that at
  the time.\r\n We weren't trying to figure out what it was or why it was.\r\n We
  were just like, oh, we have a meetup that's kind of like that.\r\n Let's try to
  transverse it into this.\r\n And we have another one called Open Source Bug Bash.\r\n
  But we limit it to 12 people,\r\n and they all have to be fairly experienced just
  to join the group.\r\n We ask questions to people that haven't been delivering software
  for a while.\r\n Yeah, so that's interesting.\r\n You have a gated group.\r\n So
  it's like you have to meet at a certain threshold.\r\n And that's kind of interesting.\r\n
  That's an interesting perspective for a lot of user groups\r\n who are trying to
  figure out how to appeal to people who've gone past.\r\n I just interviewed Matt
  Polito and he talked about\r\n always bringing in new blood and having to have introductory
  topics,\r\n but how do you satisfy people who've been down the road for a while?\r\n
  And for Open Source Bug Bash, it's kind of a weird thing\r\n because one of the
  reasons that these folks are coming\r\n is because it's a smaller group, and they
  just like smaller groups.\r\n I talked to Evan Light one time,\r\n and come to find
  out, he thinks that smaller groups are better.\r\n The big after party, he didn't
  like it so much.\r\n We ended up back at this hotel room,\r\n and this is not an
  appropriate statement,\r\n although anybody that knows me is probably expecting
  it to become one.\r\n But we were there with Aaron Kalin,\r\n Corey Emke from Front
  Club,\r\n and just this nice group of people\r\n who all just kind of wanted to
  have some good whiskey\r\n and sit around and shoot the shit.\r\n They're the same
  people that we end up getting\r\n minus whiskey, plus laptop at Open Source Bug
  Bash.\r\n We actually had somebody you interviewed last time,\r\n Andy Lester at
  Chicago Web Comp.\r\n You interviewed Andy Lester.\r\n And we met Andy there, and
  he's been a cool friend of ours since then.\r\n Yeah, he's a very interesting guy.\r\n
  On my neck of the woods.\r\n That's where Jesus lost his shoes.\r\n Yeah, we were
  out there.\r\n So you were able to have...\r\n You have a pretty open thing where
  just anybody can come into it\r\n with the Craftsman Night Out,\r\n just kind of
  an open-door policy,\r\n but then you have the Open Hack,\r\n which sounds like
  it's a little bit more open,\r\n but the higher-end or a little bit more sophisticated
  group\r\n of the Open Source Bug Bash,\r\n which I'm presuming you're committing
  code back into Open Source Projects.\r\n Yeah.\r\n Is there anything in particular
  you focus on?\r\n Oh, no.\r\n We're just starting.\r\n We're just starting to figure
  that part out.\r\n Really, what we do,\r\n what we're going to do, more or less,\r\n
  is we're going to have people write on the board\r\n what they're going to hack
  on\r\n and whether or not they're willing to take a pair.\r\n Okay.\r\n And so somebody
  comes in and they're fixing a bug with rails.\r\n Somebody else walks in and says,\r\n
  oh, yeah, I saw that bug.\r\n I want to pair with that dude and knock that one out.\r\n
  So that's basically, more or less, the way that we try to approach it.\r\n Now,
  Open Hack, since it's going to have a larger audience,\r\n potentially some...\r\n
  younger blood and some more junior folks,\r\n we're going to have that same format,\r\n
  but we're going to have that same format\r\n in an environment where it's going
  to be pretty reasonable.\r\n We're doing it in the Braintree space,\r\n which I've
  never been there,\r\n but I've heard it's really super awesome and huge.\r\n So
  we're probably going to have a pretty big turnout for those events.\r\n And, you
  know, there's a good reason people are coming there.\r\n People are coming there
  because it is an Open Source thing\r\n and they do want to kind of help out with
  that stuff.\r\n Yeah, and have you reached out to any local Open Source guys?\r\n
  Or are you just...\r\n Like, oh, this is a cool project, we like this thing, so
  we want to support it.\r\n So is it...\r\n It's anything.\r\n It's literally going
  to be a whiteboard where you write your name\r\n and what library you're hacking
  on,\r\n perhaps, you know, which bug you're going to try to attack.\r\n But it's
  more or less just to, you know,\r\n create the environment of approachability\r\n
  for anybody that's hacking on something.\r\n Okay.\r\n We still don't know how we're
  going to link that,\r\n where that dude is, kind of thing.\r\n Maybe we'll put a
  number on their head.\r\n I'm sorry.\r\n Let's say that we're at...\r\n Oh, if I
  walk up to the boardroom, I'm like,\r\n Brad Wilkening, working on this, this, that.\r\n
  Oh, and you come in and you go...\r\n Nobody knows who I am.\r\n Right.\r\n We haven't
  figured that part out yet.\r\n Oh, you just feel like, hey, who's Brad?\r\n Yeah.\r\n
  And he was working on...\r\n If it gets over 20, that's going to get a little gnarly.\r\n
  Yeah, yeah.\r\n But it's up...\r\n So, but going to the...\r\n What you talked about,
  the smaller groups\r\n and what Evan said about the smaller groups.\r\n So you said
  you prefer the smaller groups\r\n because they're a little bit...\r\n Well, why
  is that?\r\n Why do you prefer...\r\n Why did Evan say you prefer...\r\n Why do
  you prefer smaller groups over larger groups?\r\n Well, I'm going to wholesale just
  speak for Evan right now.\r\n Yeah.\r\n It's because...\r\n I don't have anything
  funny to say here,\r\n so it's not going to be any fun.\r\n I'm kidding.\r\n So,
  I think it's actually just kind of...\r\n It's a dichotomy.\r\n It's a natural dichotomy
  in human behavior.\r\n You like to have some quiet time.\r\n You like to have some
  busy time.\r\n And you need both, and both are very healthy\r\n and have benefits.\r\n
  So if you do both, you're going to be happy\r\n with the results of it.\r\n And,
  you know,\r\n that's not a very objective thing to say.\r\n I'm basically just saying,\r\n
  hey, it'll be amazing.\r\n But more or less,\r\n there are also just people that
  don't function well\r\n in larger groups of people.\r\n They're going to try to
  consolidate themselves\r\n into a single group.\r\n And that is a totally natural
  introvert thing to do.\r\n And even us extroverts,\r\n like me and Brian Ray,\r\n
  are willing to every now and then say,\r\n yeah, that was a cool meetup with all
  five of us.\r\n Yeah.\r\n You know?\r\n And we got a lot done.\r\n We talked about
  some cool stuff.\r\n And who cares?\r\n But it's...\r\n It's always that different
  kind of...\r\n It's not keeping the score.\r\n It's keeping it real.\r\n I guess.\r\n
  Like I said, shameless.\r\n Yes.\r\n You're most definitely keeping it real\r\n
  as often as possible.\r\n But yeah,\r\n that's kind of the onset of those events.\r\n
  And some people try to use those for hiring.\r\n You know, like there's a new one.\r\n
  I forgot the name of it.\r\n But it's basically just...\r\n It's a recruiting firm\r\n
  that's putting out these presentations\r\n that may be great.\r\n And we're not
  kind of doing that.\r\n We like the effect of people showing up\r\n and interacting
  with each other\r\n more than we do staring at the guy talking.\r\n Yeah.\r\n You
  know, that's an okay thing from time to time.\r\n But none of our groups really
  harness that\r\n or give that a hug.\r\n Okay.\r\n Well, thank you very much\r\n
  for coming to Time to Sit Down.\r\n Absolutely.\r\n Thank you."

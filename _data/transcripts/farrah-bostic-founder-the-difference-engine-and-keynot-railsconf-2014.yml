  Hi, it's Mike with Ucastic. I'm here at RailsConf 2014, and
   I'm standing here with
   Farah Bostic, who gave the end-of-the-day keynote on our
   first day of conference. Farah, thank you
   for taking the time to speak with me. This is take two, I
   apologize about that. So, Farah, can you
   tell us about what the keynote was about, the subject? Sure
  , the title of the talk was "What
   happens to everyone when everyone learns to code?" And I'm
   a beginner coder myself, I've built a few
   things, I use Rails as the framework for doing that. But
   the thing that I was thinking a lot
   about is what happens when more people start to be kind of
   like me, where we have a kind of
   conversational understanding of code, and how does that
   impact how we all can work together,
   techs and tech and dev people and non-tech and dev people.
   And really, it kind of came down to,
   a little bit of storytelling about my path into Rails and
   into the community, as well as some
   ideas that I've been thinking a lot about in terms of, we
   need non-technical people, need the
   technical people to be part of the strategy of a product
   and to be part of the real high-level
   decision-making about the business and the user experience,
   and really what kind of problem we're
   trying to solve. And so that means we need to understand a
   little bit more of code, and we're
   going to have fluent conversations, and we're going to be
   able to do that. And we're going to
   have conversations with our dev partners, and our dev
   partners need to have more sort of investment
   and understanding of the decisions that have to be made at
   the business level and at the user
   experience level.
   And you're not the first person I've heard of that is a
   business person who came into Rails.
   What is it about, then you come into programming through
   Rails, what was it about Rails in
   particular that, how did you even find out about it?
   Right, it was a combination of things. I had been a little
   bit familiar with PHP from a while
   back.
   I actually started out as a copywriter in advertising, but
   the thing about being a copywriter in
   advertising is not a lot of agencies need junior copyw
  riters. So I went to work for a web design
   shop. And so you had to kind of learn how to make things on
   the internet. It was too small of a
   business to have specialists, really. So I knew a little
   bit about PHP, hadn't done anything with it
   in a really long time. And a friend of mine, Noah Breyer,
   who founded Percolate, he kind of
   reintroduced me to PHP and to kind of application.
   Right.
   And so I played around a little bit with PHP. I went to a
   startup weekend in New York in
   like October 2010 and was talking to lots of people about
   wanting to take that a little
   bit farther and learning to code and asking for advice on
   how to do that. And just about
   every developer I talked to at startup weekend said Rails
   was probably the most friendly
   framework for getting into coding at the application level
   because it's bit pseudo-code that runs,
   right?
   Right.
   So it's like, it's as close to plain language as you're
   going to get. And so it was kind
   of hard to get. That was the take in 2010 at least. And
   then that got layered on with
   picking up Chris Pine's book, Learning to Program, and that
  's Ruby-based, so then I
   started to get a little bit of an understanding of the
   underlying framework. And then my boyfriend
   is Stuart Echols, who's a Rails guy, so he sort of got
   layered on with more help.
   Okay.
   So there was some...
   Yes.
   Because I've heard recently that Rails is... There's
   concern in the Rails community that
   it's becoming much harder to...
   Much harder to get started. So I was curious as to when...
   You said 2010 was around the
   time that you got started. I just would like to go a little
   further and ask, have you continued
   to use Rails since then, or...?
   Yeah. Yeah, I have. And in fact, I sort of just started
   playing around at the playing
   around level. And then I used Rails to build from the
   ground up my own website for my business.
   And I did that at least, we'll say twice...
   Right.
   Like, shipped versions of the site. But of course it was
   more like 10,000 times, it seems
   like.
   Right.
   But both times, for both major designs of it, I did it all
   myself, I did it all in Rails.
   And so I kind of just keep coming back to that, because I
   now have a kind of comfort
   level with it. I know where things are. And so I can kind
   of drop back in any time.
   But I'm really curious, have you felt the changes in the
   ecosystem? I'm like, "Really,
   what's this CoffeeScript thing?"
   I thought I just needed to know JavaScript, too.
   Right. Well, so that was also part of my talk yesterday, is
   that I think about as far as
   I've got with the actual application side really is Rails.
   And so I don't understand
   anything about Java or Coffee or any of the rest of it. I
   drink coffee.
   Yeah.
   But so the thing for me winds up being a heavy dependency
   on Rails developers who translated
   a piece of script in another language into a gem that I can
   just go ahead and implement.
   Okay.
   And then every once in a while I have to ask for help when
   it really shouldn't be
   done that way, or can't yet be done that way. So I've
   noticed the changes, I've noticed
   these CoffeeScript files, and I've noticed those things.
   But I'm still pretty intimidated
   by going too far under the hood. So I live in model views
   and controllers and routes,
   and I kind of leave it as much as possible at that.
   That is the most pleasant area.
   Yes.
   The question I have is for other people who might be
   looking at learning to code, or at
   least they have a product idea or something they'd like to
   do. Is the ecosystem so friendly
   to that, from your perspective?
   I think so. I think there's a couple of reasons why it
   still strikes me as incredibly
   friendly. And one is that Rails seems to be sort of the
   default framework for most of
   the code schools, or at least the preferred framework. So I
  've taken some classes through
   the Flatiron School in New York and Codecademy and other
   kinds of things. I still find it's
   basically pretty intuitive.
   As far as I'm going to be intuitive for someone who's never
   coded before. And I think it's
   still a great place to relatively rapidly be able to make
   something that works. And
   just as an example of that, I was at a conference a couple
   of years ago where we were sort of
   doing brainstorming sessions around business people getting
   kind of creatively stuck. And
   everyone had the same kind of pieces of advice about how to
   get unstuck. And so we made little
   paper fortune tellers.
   Right.
   And we made basically a Rails app that does the same thing,
   just a randomizer.
   Right.
   And so like three hours later we had a working, very basic
   app. And Rails was a really friendly
   thing to do that in, because you could tell really quickly
   whether it worked.
   Yeah.
   Because someone else had already kind of worked out the
   basic mechanism of what's basically
   a magic eight ball.
   Yeah.
   So, yeah.
   And as a developer myself, it's fascinating to hear this.
   With the conversation this morning
   with, I was, I'm sorry, yesterday morning with DHH, there's
   been so much, I don't know
   how long at all, on Twitter, kerfuffle over whether or not
   TDD is dead or alive or is
   it on, but what do these say? You know, is it good or bad?
   And we obsess over these kind
   of details, but when DHH was talking, he was talking about
   letting go of this astronaut
   stuff. But then here are people who are not necessarily a
   developer background, are able
   to come into these tools and do something productive and
   rate and make money.
   Right.
   And pay the bills using these tools.
   Right.
   I mean, does that strike you as kind of bizarre, when you
   hear us obsessing over, like, whether
   or not we should do things a certain way, and you're like,
   "I just took it, and I did
   it, and it's great."
   Right.
   There it is.
   Well, not at all. In fact, you know, my background being in
   marketing and market research, we
   have the same obsessions. We're obsessing about the best
   way to buy media. We're obsessing
   about programmatic ad buying. We're obsessing about the
   most sciency ways of doing market
   research. And having spent 15 years working in those
   industries and kind of taking a step
   back and peeling back a lot of the trappings of that stuff,
   I think what I find sort of
   encouraging is every industry and every community is
   arguing about things that matter to them,
   whether they should matter or not. And that there is this
   kind of inevitable ebb and flow
   that seems to happen between obsessing about details or
   testing frameworks or making things
   easy or what really makes a coder versus not a coder. And
   those sort of existential debates
   are necessary to these communities. And then inevitably,
   somebody has to be the one who
   sort of drops a bomb and says, "Actually, those things don
  't matter, or they don't matter
   as much as we say they do." So, DHH's talk yesterday, I was
  , like, jotting notes going,
   "Well, a lot of market research is also pseudoscience, and
   it's the same kind of idea of test-driven
   development, but in communications."
   Right.
   And that's something that I've kind of gone...
   This beginner's mind thing works pretty well for me in
   building stuff in Rails.
   It works pretty well for me in the way I do the work I do
   now as a product strategist,
   which is everything's a bit rough and ready, and that's the
   point, is we have to make decisions
   quickly. Things have to shift. We don't have time to worry
   about, you know, the kind of
   metaphorical equivalent of four lines of test code for
   every one line of working code.
   And I really appreciate that whole, "Sometimes it just has
   to be good enough."
   I wouldn't have these interviews if it wasn't...
   Eventually, just having to let go and be like, "Okay."
   Exactly.
   And a lot of people come into the interviews and they say,
   "Well, what if I make a mistake
   or I stutter or, you know, what if I can't think of an
   answer?"
   And I'm like, "I can't think of questions."
   It happens.
   But, you know, it's all just...
   As long as you're making something, eventually you can...
   Well, that's the other thing I really responded to with his
   talk yesterday morning was this
   idea of, you know, the engineer metaphor, the science
   metaphor, and all those things
   were uncomfortable for him, that the truth is that coders
   are software writers.
   And because I started out as a writer as well and still do
   write, writing practice is writing
   practice, whether you're writing a new gem or a new project
   or you're writing an article
   or an essay or a short story.
   You have to sit down and write.
   And kind of the first thing you have to do is put ink on
   the page.
   And whatever format that looks like.
   Because the worst thing is a blank page, right?
   The worst moment for you right now is before you hit the
   record button because, "Oh, my
   God, what's going to happen?"
   Or, likewise, when I hit Rails New and I'm trying to even
   think about what I should
   name the project.
   Yes, exactly.
   What should I name it, you know?
   I'm talking about obsessing over the wrong things.
   Right.
   And then you kind of forget the flexibility and the
   opportunity to edit.
   And, like, I don't have to know what every field in my
   database is going to be when I
   raise the scaffold.
   At a certain point, I can just sort of -- I can add things
   to it later.
   It's minimal.
   Yeah, exactly.
   And so I really reacted to that as, like, yes, that I think
   is what I like about learning
   this language and this framework is that it's a new way to
   think and to write.
   And I like both of those things.
   Well, great.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak.

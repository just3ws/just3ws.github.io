  Hi, I'm Mike.
   I'm here again at Windy City Rails with Noel Rappin.
   Hi, everybody.
   Noel is also another one of those people that have been around pretty much forever inside
   of the Ruby community.
   That's frightening.
   Yeah.
   And particularly here in Chicago, and you know, he often teaches, you often teach workshops
   as well as speak at a conference, and just kind of like, you know, the differences between
   speaking and teaching a workshop at a conference.
   Well, yeah, I think there are differences of scale.
   You know, you go to, there's two differences really.
   One is the scale of it.
   When you're doing a regular conference presentation, you're speaking in front of, you know, 150,
   200 people in a large room for not as much time, and those workshops tend to be around
   a dozen people, and they tend to be more intimate in scale, and you have a longer time to interact
   with people.
   And also the workshops typically are people who are specifically choosing to be in that
   time.
   It's an extra cost, it's a time, it's certainly a time investment.
   Whereas in a conference talk, people are coming to the conference more than they're coming
   to see you in specific, so you normally, you have to maybe do a little bit more of a job
   of explaining why you're there and what's important to it.
   The people that come to a day-long workshop, they're self-selected.
   They already think this is important because they're spending a day on it.
   And I mean, I've heard people kind of describing the person who's standing up in front of the
   audience teaching as being kind of the school mentor, I mean, excuse me, the school teacher
   standing up in front of an audience lecturing the audience of the students versus, you know,
   the hands-on person who's down with the student teaching a lesson.
   Well, yeah.
   I mean, the workshop is effective generally in proportion to the extent that I'm not
   talking, you know.
   I'm as guilty of this in teaching as I am of anything else.
   If I'm spending the whole time talking, you know, that's maybe not the most effective
   use of the time.
   You know, if somebody is asking a question, then even if it is sort of a digression, then,
   you know, for the course of that question, at the very least, I'm answering something
   that is of interest to somebody in the room because they've asked it, but even better
   is when people have the opportunity to really try something and have questions that emerge
   out of their experience.
   As they're working through something rather than trying to impose an experience on them,
   which is something that I could stand to get better at.
   And it also leads me to think about how an open laptop in a class is a good thing.
   An open laptop during a session, you know, listening to Steve Klabnick's talk, which
   was very, it was a very thoughtful presentation and seeing all the laptops open.
   Well, you know.
   So there's a lap, you know, there are, there are, there are different scales of that.
   You know, I'm looking around and I'm seeing people who are, their laptops are open, but
   they're taking notes or they're using a mind map software to really try and engage with
   the material while the present, presenter's doing it, or people are, you know, checking
   Twitter.
   You know, those are, those are different levels of engagement and, and, but you can often
   tell from the other side of the laptop, even if you can't see the laptop screen, whether
   somebody is really engaging with what you're trying to say or not.
   Yeah.
   I saw a lot of code on screens.
   You always, yeah, that, you know, one thing definitely, a lot of people are, a lot of
   people are still working on code.
   So, I mean, has that ever been something that's been distracting for you on stage or?
   It's only distracting, as a, as a presenter in a large room, it's generally not distracting
   unless they're distracting other people, usually, or unless there's such a critical mass of
   people that have checked out that, but, but that, that doesn't usually happen.
   Yeah.
   In a small room, it's much more obvious.
   If a couple people have checked out, and, and that can be distracting if you're, you
   know, if you're, if you're doing a workshop to even like 12 people and, and two or three
   of them have, maybe they have valid reasons, you know, maybe something genuinely important
   came up, but they're, they've checked out, like that, that stands out in a small room
   in a way that it doesn't necessarily.
   Do you ever, have you ever had that happen where you've been up on a stage and seen a
   bunch of laptops opening up and you're like, maybe I should alter, you know?
   Um, in a, in a, in a short form presentation, then I don't, I don't normally have a, a leeway
   really to, to do that necessarily.
   In a, in a small room, I'll usually joke about it.
   Yeah.
   You know, I, I'll make it, make it obvious that, or make it clear that I can kind of
   tell that they've, that they've checked out.
   Um, a lot of times, you know, in a workshop situation, um, there, there's two ways to
   look at it.
   I mean, I could be not doing a good job.
   Um, they could be not paying attention.
   Like, I, I don't necessarily know.
   Um, you know, these, you know, if people come voluntarily to come sit in the room
   and they think the best use of their time is to sit in the room and, and write code,
   I don't know, maybe it is.
   Um, I try not to get, I've done this enough that I try very hard not to take it
   personally.
   Um, except to the extent that I try to think about what I might not be, what I
   might be doing not to, to, to not be serving.
   And, you know, speaking more about the, because you've done so much teaching, you
   were, you were, you were a teacher before.
   Well, you taught at the college level.
   Only a little bit.
   I only, only the extent that I was a graduate student, but I, I, I did run some
   classes.
   Is, have you seen any, over the years, have you seen any kind of an evolution in
   the audience dynamic at a conference?
   Not, not that I could say over time.
   I think that the regional conferences have gotten, you know, sort of bigger and
   more structured.
   Um, that there's, you know, even just, but even just the idea of having training
   days as something that's a regular thing is really only a couple of years old.
   It's probably a little too soon to think of that as something that's evolving.
   I think that what has happened in the Ruby community is that the, the regional
   conference, the regional conferences have become, you know, more established and,
   and, and, uh, more professional and sort of better organized just in general, and
   I think, and larger.
   And I think that that has, uh, that has more of an effect on, on, on what happens
   than, than the community changing over time.
   Yeah, because the, the one thing with that, kind of what makes me think about with
   the structure is, is it, uh, people are too much on a, on a, uh, I mean, we use the
   word track to describe, you know, a series of, of presentations, but, um, the people
   tend to move on tracks and that they are almost like a school.
   I mean, if you think about it, it's almost like you go to class and then you have a
   break and then you go to the next class and then you have a launch.
   Right, and that's, that's, you know, there's a limit, you know, I think that in a
   single track conference like this one, you know, there's, it's not quite a school, but I,
   I, I think of it as kind of like a chance, as much as anything, it's a chance to hear
   perspectives that you wouldn't otherwise hear.
   Like, I'm not normally going to, um, maybe to my detriment, I'm not normally going to
   spend 45 minutes thinking about philosophy as it relates to my work, but it's a really
   interesting perspective to have and now maybe I might seek it out.
   Um, I, I think that, that, uh, you know, lecture, which is what these day-long
   conferences tend to be, um, it has its strengths.
   Weaknesses and weaknesses is a teaching tool, but it's a really good way to introduce,
   introduce things, uh, it's a really good way to get a, a, a, a sense that something might
   be interesting to you to explore, you know, I really like, there have been a couple talks
   today and yesterday that, um, have had some practical things that I can, you know, actually
   start using right now.
   Right.
   And I think that that's really great, too.
   Yeah, I think it's nice at a conference to have a mixture of the practical and the
   theoretical.
   Yeah, I think that, yeah, I agree.
   Okay, well, thank you very much, Noel, for taking the time.
   Thanks, Mike.
   All right.
   We'll have a link to your book, too, as well.
   Oh, great.
   Thank you.

  Kay.\r\n Arthur Kay, he founded the Censure User Group, but thank you for taking
  the time to sit down with me.\r\n What is Censure and why do you have a user group?\r\n
  So, Censure is a tech company that makes a series of JavaScript frameworks\r\n as
  well as some supporting tools to help developers build desktop and mobile applications.\r\n
  And so we started the group because we have a tremendous user community,\r\n both
  here in Chicago and around the world,\r\n and I wanted to kind of gather the community
  here in Chicago since this is where I'm based.\r\n Okay, so when you say the JavaScript
  tools, what are the big ones people would know?\r\n So, primarily...\r\n Who should
  know?\r\n Primarily people are going to know Censure Touch or our EFTJS products,\r\n
  which are JavaScript libraries for building either mobile or desktop-based web applications.\r\n
  And Raphael, right?\r\n Raphael is a sort of side project that we have built up\r\n
  and sort of extended to build the charting packages within both Censure Touch and
  EFTJS.\r\n Okay, so it's more like...\r\n It's more like a lower-level API.\r\n
  Yes.\r\n Okay, yes.\r\n But Censure Touch is the big...\r\n For building the mobile
  apps.\r\n Yes.\r\n Yes, that's correct.\r\n Okay, so you're supporting the people
  who are using the frameworks and those tools.\r\n Are you a Censure employee or...?\r\n
  Yes, so I work at Vore Censure.\r\n My role is on the professional services team
  as a solutions engineer.\r\n Okay.\r\n And that kind of boils down to going out
  to our larger clients to help do product development,\r\n to do product trainings,
  to physically help build applications.\r\n Sometimes I speak at conferences and
  do a variety of other things.\r\n So what kind of topics do you do in the future
  Censure meeting groups?\r\n Censure meetings.\r\n Yeah, that's a tough one.\r\n
  Censure.\r\n So here at the Chicago User Group, we cover a variety of topics almost
  always geared towards\r\n the Censure tools and Censure frameworks.\r\n So this
  month, right?\r\n This month, for example, we are talking about Siesta, which is
  a unit testing framework.\r\n Some months we cover Censure Touch and go in-depth
  into how to build custom components.\r\n Sometimes we cover native packaging.\r\n
  Censure offers some native packaging tools.\r\n Sometimes we even cover topics that
  aren't directly related to Censure's frameworks.\r\n If there are either outlying
  JavaScript libraries that might plug into an application or a method\r\n or methodology
  that developers might want to use in their own projects, then sometimes\r\n we'll
  have a guest speaker come in and present those topics as well.\r\n Yeah, because
  you're so much of a JavaScript-based system, do you ever work with the local JavaScript\r\n
  groups and have cross-meetings or anything?\r\n Once in a while, yeah.\r\n There
  have been a few times where we, or I should say, that I have gone out and spoken\r\n
  at the Chicago JavaScript Meetup.\r\n They've been kind enough to host us, I think,
  twice.\r\n And I've been to a force.com meeting, and I've been trying to get some
  other of these\r\n groups to come in and present, like I said, some topics that
  plug into the ecosystem that\r\n Censure developers are going to be somewhat familiar
  with, so something web or native-based,\r\n probably in a JavaScript manner.\r\n
  Okay, so, or anything like a back-to-basics, back-to-fundamentals?\r\n Yeah.\r\n
  Okay.\r\n Yeah, those kinds of things.\r\n So, what's really, what made you want
  to start the group, and how long has the group\r\n been around?\r\n So, the group's
  been around for not quite two years now, and back when Censure first\r\n hired me,
  which was the, I think, the winter of 2010, they, or I should say, I had previously\r\n
  been using Censure.\r\n So, I had been using Censure's products, and I was trying
  to connect with other developers\r\n here in Chicago, and I just never really gathered
  enough steam to get the group off the ground.\r\n And once Censure brought me on
  board, they made it very easy to facilitate that.\r\n They would provide some sponsorship
  of paying for the meetup.com site that we have, and that\r\n really allowed me to
  go out.\r\n And find people, get the location that we have to meet every month,
  and then bring people\r\n into the group.\r\n Okay, great.\r\n And, actually, to
  kind of answer my next question I was going to ask about the sponsorship,\r\n it's,
  obviously, Censure is very interested and supportive of, like, about how many people\r\n
  do you usually see?\r\n Because it's, like, I just say, like, when I saw the Censure
  group, I had to do a little\r\n bit of research, even, to find out what Censure
  is.\r\n Like, how do you know, like, how do you go about sharing that there is this
  group, and\r\n also reaching people that might not otherwise know of the toolkits?\r\n
  Sure.\r\n So, on a month-to-month basis, the number of people that we have attending
  varies somewhat.\r\n Usually we get between 15 and 40 people every month, and usually
  people have found the group\r\n either through meetup.com.\r\n That means that they
  have been members of other JavaScript groups and noticed that we\r\n are here, sort
  of signed up.\r\n Right.\r\n Or, on the Censure message boards, I can go out and
  advertise that we've got a group looking\r\n for people here in Chicago.\r\n Oh,
  okay.\r\n So, there's a channel through the Censure.\r\n There's a channel there,
  and then, as I said, Censure really goes out of their way to help\r\n support our
  group, as well as the other groups that are around the country.\r\n So, if you have
  downloaded one of our products, you're probably on the Censure mailing list.\r\n
  Right.\r\n And once every couple of weeks when we send out here the upcoming events
  that Censure\r\n will be at, they will highlight some of the user groups in the
  areas.\r\n So, those are primarily the avenues that people find us.\r\n Sometimes
  it's just word of mouth, you know, colleagues and coworkers will tag along with\r\n
  people.\r\n Okay.\r\n So, what is your typical schedule?\r\n We typically meet once
  a month.\r\n We meet the last Thursday of every month.\r\n Last Thursday.\r\n Okay.\r\n
  You know, with this being November, next month being December, that will change
  a little\r\n bit for the holidays.\r\n Yeah.\r\n But we almost always meet once
  a month, and it's almost always on Thursday.\r\n Okay.\r\n Well, thank you very
  much for taking the time to sit down.\r\n Well, I very much appreciate it.\r\n Thank
  you."

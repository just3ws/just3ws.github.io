content: "Hi, it's Mike here with Yugtastic. I'm sitting down with Avdi Grim who runs
  the\r\n Ruby Tapas and the Ruby Rogues and the, excuse me, the Wide Teams blogs
  and\r\n podcasts. He also does this very interesting thing where he'll remote\r\n
  pair with people on open source projects and also some paid projects. Avdi,\r\n
  thank you for taking the time to sit down. Can you tell me a little bit about\r\n
  how you got started doing these remote pairs and and how that's been working\r\n
  out for you? Well, thanks for having me. So, the remote pairing, just, I don't know,\r\n
  I think it seemed like a natural progression, honestly. I had been\r\n working remotely
  for a long time. That's just been sort of one of my\r\n long-term intentions was
  to work from home because I like being around my\r\n family and I like choosing
  where I live based on other things, you know,\r\n besides being in a tech hub or
  something like that. So, I'm out in sort of\r\n suburban Pennsylvania here. And
  so, I've been working remotely for a long time\r\n for various companies and I am
  also a fan of pair programming because I've\r\n seen how effective it can be for
  spreading practices throughout a group\r\n and, you know, for keeping everyone on
  the same page and keeping\r\n the bus number down and stuff like that. So, you know,
  I've been, so, you\r\n know, the kind of the natural thing was I'd been pairing
  within companies that\r\n I'd worked with or for remotely for a long time. And at
  one point this summer, I\r\n found myself with the opportunity of taking another
  traditional consulting\r\n gig, but I had been really feeling the pressure, the
  pressure on my time from\r\n the consulting gigs that I had. I felt like I wasn't
  able to move forward on\r\n some projects that I wanted to get going, like Ruby
  Tapas. And I wanted\r\n something that would be more flexible, something that, you
  know, it wouldn't be,\r\n wouldn't be, you know, hours and hours and hours a day
  and also where I didn't have\r\n to feel like, like getting a, you know, like getting,
  getting the, the product\r\n shipped was dependent on me working overtime and stuff
  like that. I wanted to\r\n be able to, to actually like, you know, have a good cutoff
  with the work that I\r\n was doing for people. And that can be hard sometimes, even
  with consulting, it\r\n can be hard to, to sort of draw that, you know, draw those
  boundaries. And so I, I had, I,\r\n I had already been taking some sort of some
  ad hoc pair programming appointments\r\n and, and not as an intentional thing, but
  just some people had gotten in touch with\r\n me. You know, people that I knew from,
  from, from other things had just said,\r\n Hey, can I, could we set up a thing where
  I pay you and we just do remote pairing\r\n from time to time? You know, and usually
  somebody that wasn't typically people\r\n that didn't have a good, like they weren't
  in a company that had a lot of other Ruby\r\n programmers, you know, maybe they
  were the only program or maybe they were consulting like our sole consultant.\r\n
  For something like that. And they wanted to work with somebody else, you know, to,
  to just both for the\r\n company and, and to hone their skills and stuff like that.
  And, and so I've been doing that for a few\r\n people and I thought, you know, they
  seem to be getting a lot out of it and coming back. And so\r\n what if I just did
  more of that instead of the traditional consulting? And so I, you know, I took\r\n
  some time to cut, like, think about like, what would that look like? You know, and,
  and sort of, and write\r\n up some, some copy about, you know, the sort of things
  that I could, I could\r\n consult on as a, as a consulting pair programmer. And,
  and then I just kind of\r\n put my shingle out there and I have been, you know,
  basically flooded with, with\r\n requests for appointments ever since.\r\n Oh, okay.
  And, I mean, do you mostly get open source projects or do you get a lot\r\n of,
  of, of paid work through this as well?\r\n I think I would say, I think I get more
  submissions\r\n for paid work than I, I get for open, open source work. Now, I,
  I do have to, I, I run a, a\r\n backlog for the open source work just because I'm
  not able to do as many of those appointments. I do\r\n those for free. I do free
  pay, pair programming if it's, if it's on open source software and, and I'd\r\n
  love to be able to do more than I do, but right now I can only do one a week because
  it's, you know, it\r\n doesn't pay the bills.\r\n Right. And I'm kind of curious,
  you know, Gary Bernhard, I interviewed him over a\r\n SCNA and he's talked about
  how doing the destroy all software, he has people just sending him\r\n requests
  and, and, and saying, you know, can you look at this code, can analyze it?\r\n And
  they kind of an expectation that he can do all that.\r\n Do you get that with the
  pair program?\r\n Do you ever get people saying, hey, why don't you have time for,
  for my project?\r\n Or has it been pretty like congenial?\r\n What has your been
  your experience?\r\n No, it's, it's, it's, it's been extremely genial.\r\n I, I,
  anybody who follows me on Twitter.\r\n Well, first of all, knows that I tweet way
  too much, but also knows that like somewhere between\r\n like, you know, like once
  a week or to once a month, I tweet the same line over and over again.\r\n I get
  the nicest emails.\r\n Yes.\r\n And, and it's because I do and I keep tweeting that
  because it keeps happening.\r\n You know, I honestly, the, the Ruby community is
  fantastic.\r\n And, and I don't know what it is, but, but I get, you know, for what
  I get is, is just the\r\n nicest things that people, people say.\r\n And, and I
  don't really, I occasionally, I've had people, I've had, you know, I, I get a\r\n
  lot of requests for, can you give me some advice?\r\n Now I'd say more often, it's
  more like career advice than it is like, can you fix this code?\r\n Okay.\r\n But,
  you know, I try to get back to everyone, you know, sometimes I'll say, look, I,
  I'm sorry.\r\n I, I tried to look at this, but I just didn't have time to really
  dig into it.\r\n Right.\r\n But for, but I, I know, I, I wouldn't say I get a ton
  of people being like,\r\n can you, you know, please fix my code now.\r\n Okay.\r\n
  Yeah.\r\n Yes.\r\n That was a, that was one thing I had to wonder is like, how much
  is a signal to noise?\r\n Do you get on these requests for, you know, where somebody
  like, you remember, I don't\r\n know if you ever looked at old code project or anything
  like that.\r\n Some of the older code sites where people would go in and basically
  post, um, or no, it\r\n was, uh, the guru, um, sites for, can you do my homework
  for me?\r\n Kind of requests.\r\n Um, I just wondered if you got those kinds of
  things, um, but, uh, um, the, the, the\r\n weird.\r\n Every now and then I get like
  somebody, the, the, the most common, the most common sort\r\n of like missing request
  that kind of misses the target is, is I'll get a request that\r\n says for an open
  source pairing session that says, I, I want some tutoring, you know, I,\r\n I like,
  I want to pass this test and I'd like some tutoring and I have to say, look, the,\r\n
  the open source pairing sessions are really for putting code back into the community.\r\n
  Right.\r\n Uh, so like if you have a project that you own or that you want to.\r\n
  Uh, you know, commit, commit to not commit to, but, you know, make some submissions
  to,\r\n uh, that's open source, you know, that's, that's really what that's for.\r\n
  It's not really about me teaching.\r\n Yeah.\r\n So it's not, uh, really code 101.\r\n
  It's more of, you kind of have to have some, at least basic, uh, experience with
  programming\r\n and be almost there.\r\n It just may be a little bit of guidance
  or, or something that you need.\r\n Yeah.\r\n I mean, I do a lot of tutoring, a
  lot of training and tutoring.\r\n But that's pretty much under the, the content
  in the context of paid sessions.\r\n Okay.\r\n Uh, because, you know, it's, it's,
  I mean, it's tiring and it's, it takes, um, it takes\r\n a lot out, out of someone
  to, you know, to do that kind of, that kind of work.\r\n And I, I kind of look to
  the open source sessions to be a bit more relaxing, um, a bit more,\r\n you know,
  a bit more fun because, Hey, it's, you know, it's working open source code and\r\n
  that's, that's awesome.\r\n And so going over to, uh, uh, some of the,\r\n the more
  public stuff that you do, that's the, the Ruby, uh, uh, rogues.\r\n That's, uh,
  a pretty popular podcast.\r\n I seen, um, uh, Jim gray is, is trying to really get
  it elected to the, to the best\r\n podcast of the year.\r\n He's been tweeting about
  that a lot, but it's always a pretty enjoyable interview.\r\n And, um, I, matter
  of fact, I listened to your, uh, most recent interview, at least\r\n the first part
  of it where, uh, you guys have this kind of, um, um, banter.\r\n Uh, and, uh, there
  was something about jokes that can't be made.\r\n Uh, Jim, uh, Jim gray, I believe,
  uh, said something about, we can't say these certain\r\n types of jokes.\r\n And,
  and then immediately somebody made a joke about, um, back at Jim about, you know,\r\n
  the wheelchair or something like that.\r\n I was about standing desks and it was,
  you know, only friends can do that kind of thing.\r\n Yes.\r\n And, uh, and, and
  that's really what it sounds like on that podcast, you know, um, how, how\r\n did
  you guys come to start that cast?\r\n And, uh, well, let me, let me be clear here.\r\n
  I, I, I'm a late comer to that podcast.\r\n I'm, I'm the most recent addition to
  that, to that group.\r\n Okay.\r\n Um, and so as far as I know, so it's, it's Chuck's
  podcast, you know, he, he put it together\r\n initially and, um, I actually don't
  know the details of the early history.\r\n I can't remember who exactly was there
  at the beginning.\r\n I know, I'm pretty sure it was, it was Chuck and, um, and
  James.\r\n Um, and I'm not sure who else, um, at the beginning, I'd have to go back
  and look at\r\n some of the early episodes to see.\r\n And I know that they, you
  know, they added some, some folks along the way and then, and\r\n for a while there,
  um, before I came on, um, uh, Aaron Patterson was a regular.\r\n Okay.\r\n And,
  uh, you know, which is awesome, but, um, I, I came on for an episode, um, and then\r\n
  they, you know, I, I did.\r\n I didn't, I, I, I guess I didn't insult them enough
  and, and, and they, they had me back,\r\n um, for another episode.\r\n And at some
  point, um, Aaron said, decided that he just didn't have time to devote to\r\n that
  podcast every week.\r\n And at that point they, I, I basically took Aaron's slot,
  which, which, uh, is kind of\r\n a big seat to fill.\r\n Yeah.\r\n It is tender
  love.\r\n So, um, well then I'd like to just jump straight over to the distributed.\r\n
  Team or the Y team, excuse me.\r\n So, uh, apparently you, or I should say not apparently,
  but it really seems that you do\r\n have a passion for remote, uh, uh, uh, collaboration.\r\n
  Yeah.\r\n And, um, I have not yet listened to the Y teams.\r\n I saw it and it was
  kind of the day I, that I, I decided I had to contact you to talk\r\n because I
  was, I was working on you fantastic and I was not feeling good about something.\r\n
  And I saw it.\r\n I saw another Ruby tapas had come out and then I'm like, Hmm,
  uh, wow.\r\n Yeah.\r\n He's got Ruby tapas and, uh, and Ruby rogues.\r\n And then
  there was something, you tweeted something about Y teams.\r\n I was like, and then
  I went and looked at your bio.\r\n I'm like, this guy is like a, uh, between them
  and the books.\r\n I didn't even mention the books.\r\n Um, what have you learned
  through the, uh, the, the Y teams and what kind of was your\r\n inspiration for
  doing that?\r\n Well, the inspiration is just, you know, uh, I work remotely and
  I probably always.\r\n Will, because I want to live where I want to live with my
  family and, and, and I don't,\r\n you know, so, you know, my, I, a few years ago
  I thought to myself, you know, what is\r\n the best way to, to, you know, I felt
  like, you know, if, if I'm going to make a career\r\n out of working remotely with
  other software developers, it behooves me to become good\r\n at it.\r\n And I figured
  the best way to do that would be to talk to a lot of other people who are\r\n doing
  it and, you know, pick their brains.\r\n And, you know, and I also just felt like,
  you know, when I was looking around back then,\r\n I, I thought, you know, that
  didn't seem like there were a lot of good resources out there\r\n for, you know,
  there were a lot of people doing it.\r\n There are a lot of people doing different
  kinds of, of remote work arrangements, whether\r\n fully distributed or just like,
  you know, there's, you know, a main team and then there's\r\n some satellite people
  or whatever.\r\n A lot of these things were going on, but there weren't any resources
  where they were getting\r\n together and talking to each other.\r\n And so wide
  teams has always been, you know, the\r\n dream for that has always been to build
  a community around the practice of, of dispersed\r\n teams and remote work.\r\n
  So if somebody was going to sit down and grab and listen to one episode, is there
  any one\r\n particular interview that you got a lot of wisdom from or?\r\n I think
  I would have to get back to you on that one.\r\n That's a, that's a really tough
  one to answer.\r\n You know, I know a lot of people really enjoyed the Chad Fowler.\r\n
  Interview.\r\n But, you know, truth be told, there have been so many good ones.\r\n
  It's, it's, it's hard to narrow it down.\r\n Here's the question then.\r\n Is it
  one of the things sitting down with user group people and people involved in technical\r\n
  communities, I've seen certain patterns that have emerged in the way different people
  approach\r\n the community community.\r\n Have you seen that with the wide teams?\r\n
  It's like been like, oh, I've talked to these 20, 30, 50 people and some patterns
  have emerged.\r\n Is that.\r\n And something you've seen.\r\n I think a lot of people
  are, are in fairly similar situations.\r\n I mean, you have a lot of startups that,
  that, you know, they have, they have people in them\r\n that wanted to work together,
  you know, maybe they had all worked together at a previous\r\n company, but then
  they went their separate ways and, you know, different parts of the\r\n country
  or the world, you know, but they still wanted to work together.\r\n You've got some
  groups like that.\r\n You have more established companies that are just realizing
  that they don't have enough\r\n local talent to fill the slots.\r\n You know, that
  they want to, you know, to, to do the work they want to get done.\r\n And so they're
  trying to hire people from wherever the talent is rather than, than just in their\r\n
  local area.\r\n And, you know, and, and various things in between there.\r\n But
  I mean, those are some of the trends that I see.\r\n Okay.\r\n And, and just kind
  of to come to an, well, I actually have two more questions.\r\n One is, I'll just
  go with the equipment first.\r\n Because I'm.\r\n I'm curious as well.\r\n And I'm
  sure other people who are going to be working remotely, I'm curious for different\r\n
  reasons.\r\n I'm just interested about the setup you use for recording, and I'm
  sure you use some of\r\n this for your remoting work as well.\r\n What kind of microphone
  and stand and setup do you use for, for.\r\n So for recording, what I'm talking
  to right now is my, my blue snowball, which is the\r\n kind of the, I think it's
  probably one of the most recommended, you know, podcast recording\r\n mics out there
  for, if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg, you know, it's, it's USB,\r\n
  which is wonderful because you don't have to worry about like, like interference
  on the\r\n analog cables.\r\n And so that's that my stand is just some cheap stand
  that I had lying around in my, in my\r\n attic, you know, and I've got, I've got
  a pop filter that I got along with them like,\r\n and let's see what else.\r\n As
  far as like remote pairing stuff.\r\n What do you want to just know about like audio
  equipment or equipment in general?\r\n Just what do you use for communications?\r\n
  Do you, do you have a camera open regularly or do you, I try to have video going
  and here's\r\n what I do.\r\n Let me, I'm going to try to rotate this and hopefully
  this won't come tumbling down.\r\n If you look over to my right over here.\r\n Well,
  one thing you see is a mess, but let's see.\r\n If we can get this far enough over,
  let's see, you can just sort of see the corner.\r\n There it is.\r\n The corner
  of my tablet, which is mounted on a mount, which holds it up in the air.\r\n Okay,
  to my right.\r\n And what I try to do, I try to use my tablet as my primary comms
  device and it's, you know,\r\n so I've got Skype and, and, and Google+.\r\n And,
  and, uh, Google talk on it.\r\n And so I'll try to have the person that I'm working
  with on my, like over here, uh, on\r\n the tablet and I can look over to them and
  there's their, their face on video.\r\n Assuming we've got a decent enough connection.\r\n
  Um, you know, I spring for, for business broadband, but not everyone has, has a
  good connection\r\n and, and sometimes the internet has bad days.\r\n But, but,
  um, you know, I have them over here and then I usually have the screen share that\r\n
  we're working on.\r\n In front of me on my computer.\r\n So it's a little bit more
  natural than like the, the, the, like staring back at each other\r\n kind of set
  up where you're both, um, you know, where you're using the camera on your\r\n work
  laptop thing.\r\n Uh, and I, I kind of like that.\r\n It also takes some of the,
  the hardware load off of the PC that I'm working on.\r\n Yeah.\r\n And then you
  don't have to worry about a reboot or anything like that.\r\n Right.\r\n For, um,
  for that I've been lately, I've been using a, um, a\r\n VXI, uh, uh, blue parrot,
  uh, B two 50 XT plus, uh, which is a headset.\r\n It's a Bluetooth headset that
  is mainly designed as I understand it for truckers.\r\n Um, it's got ridiculously
  long battery life.\r\n It's got like 20 hours of, of talk time and a, uh, and it's
  got a fairly aggressive, um, noise\r\n control, you know, for, for surround, like
  not picking up on surrounding noises.\r\n Yeah, that would, that would be kind of
  necessary.\r\n In a truck.\r\n They're pretty loud.\r\n Yeah, but you know, it's
  nice for me because like a lot of the Bluetooth headsets out there\r\n are, they're,
  they're mainly, they're oriented towards people making occasional calls.\r\n They're
  not oriented towards somebody sitting for, you know, two, four, six, eight hours\r\n
  at a time and working with somebody else.\r\n And, uh, and so that's why I got that
  and that's been working out pretty well.\r\n And kind of where I'm going to end,
  uh, the final question is working from home, working\r\n remotely, uh, you're disconnected
  a little bit from, um, the banter.\r\n The, the chat in, in a normal office, you're
  more of a person who's on the edge of technology.\r\n You don't really, I should
  say, you know, Ruby and, and the, and the tools you're using,\r\n uh, might not
  necessarily have to depend on, uh, user groups or anything like that for\r\n seeing
  a, a breast of what's going on.\r\n But do you ever go to user groups or?\r\n Oh
  yeah.\r\n Yeah.\r\n Um, so my sort of, you know, home user group is, I would say
  is the Baltimore be more on\r\n rails group, which I've been going there.\r\n Since
  their very first meeting, I believe.\r\n Um, and, uh, there's also a group up in
  Harrisburg.\r\n Um, and I try to, I try to get, get to both of those occasionally.\r\n
  I certainly don't get every week, get down there every month, but, uh, occasionally
  I\r\n try to get to those.\r\n I have a lot of friends at both and, uh, yeah, I,
  I love users groups and I, uh, you know,\r\n it's people, like I said, a lot of
  people write to me asking about like career advice\r\n for a young programmer and
  that's usually one of the very first things that I stress is\r\n get yourself involved
  in a local users group.\r\n Right.\r\n And I would appreciate it if you put us in
  touch with them because I, I would love to\r\n interview them as well.\r\n The people
  who run those groups and, um, and the last but most important question is, do\r\n
  you have a filter for your voice or is that your own natural Barrett?\r\n I don't,
  I don't have anything going on here.\r\n I mean, it's just the mic.\r\n Okay.\r\n
  Cause I was going to say whatever it is and however much it is, I'm going to buy
  it because\r\n I need that radio voice.\r\n Um, I mean, maybe, maybe I have, maybe
  this basement just happens to have good acoustics.\r\n I don't know.\r\n Well, okay.\r\n
  Well, thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me.\r\n I really
  appreciate it.\r\n Sure.\r\n Thanks.\r\n Thank you.\r\n Okay.\r\n There's the mark.\r\n
  All right.\r\n Well, yeah, that was perfect."

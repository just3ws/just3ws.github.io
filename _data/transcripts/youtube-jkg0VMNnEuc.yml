  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2014. I
  'm standing here with
   Rhino Corey, founder of MetaDeveloper, and she is here
   doing introductions for
   the speakers for several of the presentations. Thank you
   very much for
   taking the time to speak with me. So, your relationship
   with GOTO Conf, how
   did you end up coming here and doing these introductions
   and the opening
   warm-up for these speakers? Well, there was a long way
   leading to that. So, it all
   started in Denmark, in the Middle East Kingdom of Northern
   Europe, where there
   was a company called Triforce who wanted to go to a lot of
   conferences in the US
   to see a lot of the great speakers, but they couldn't
   afford it. So, what they
   decided to do instead was to create their own conference.
   So, it started there in Denmark in 1996, and in 1998, it
   had grown to become a bit
   larger, and at that time, I just started my PhD in computer
   science, and I was
   working with programming languages and design patterns and
   correspondence
   between those two, and they invited me as a PhD student in
   their PhD track to talk
   about what I was going to do, what I was planning to do. So
  , you came in as a
   presenter? Yes, that was the way I started. I
   was, yeah, in a special track for PhD students. So, not on
   the tracks where we
   have Martin Fowler and Jess Humboldt, but... Real stuff. No
  , not like that. I was not a
   professional speaker at that time, so I presumably wasn't a
   very good speaker
   at that time. Anyway, so I finished my PhD, and I started
   doing teaching at University
   and also in industry at Triforce, and then they offered me
   a job after my PhD. So, I
   started working for them in 2001, and one of my first tasks
   was to do a
   tutorial about software architecture for the conference,
   and also to help out
   inviting some of the speakers. So, over the years, I've
   been working on and off
   with Triforce and University, but all the time I've been
   helping out with the
   conference in Denmark, inviting speakers, and now I've
   become the PC chair for
   many of the conferences that we do, because now it's not
   only in Denmark, it's in
   here in Chicago. I'm also involved in a JAO conference in
   Australia, QCon London.
   So, you're all over. Go to Berlin, Amsterdam. Yes. Yeah,
   that's a lot of
   flying. It's a lot of flying, yes. But it's very
   interesting to be part of the
   program committee, because you get the chance to spend some
   time and look at
   what are the trends, and see a lot of talks, and who are
   the good speakers, who
   could talk about this, talk about that. So, preferably, of
   course, we want speakers
   who've done something special, so that their name is well-
  known, or they're
   the brand, at least, is well-known, but also that they're
   really, really good
   speakers, entertaining, and can make people listen to what
   they're saying. And
   actually, also, on the third part, we'd like them to be
   great people to be
   around, because we like our conferences to be a cozy area.
   Social. Yeah, social, where the
   participants and the speakers can communicate with each
   other. That's also
   why we do not have a speaker room. We do not want to hide
   them away from the
   participants. Yeah, so the idea is that everybody is out
   and mingling and meeting. Yeah, exactly.
   But to do the presentations, you said you started off as a
   PhD. Did you say you
   were a student when you first came? Yeah. So, when you were
   a PhD student doing a
   presentation, now you're doing warm-ups and introducing,
   which, as you described,
   you want people that are friendly. Well, you kind of want
   somebody that's going to be a
   little bit funny to do warm-ups. How did you go from being
   this uncomfortable
   person, maybe a little bit, doing their first talk, to now
  ... Loving to be on stage. Yeah.
   Loving to be on stage and having a little bit of a
   performance. Yeah. I don't know, it
   came little after little. I remember the first really big
   presentation I gave was
   at the Uppsala conference in '98. It was one of the papers
   I had accepted, and I
   was so nervous, and I rehearsed it so many times. But now,
   it's more
   natural to me. I know basically what I want to say, and
   then when I get on
   stage, I sometimes say something completely different. But
   I just enjoy
   being there. So I don't know, it's practice. Were you
   always somebody that liked being on stage? Did you do any
   drama or anything when you were in school? No. No? Just
   once you got bit by the bug?
   Yes. It was... I've always been a shy child, never wanted
   to have any attention when
   I was a child, and now I love it. And, you know, actually
   it's interesting. I talked
   with some people who, when they go on the stage, they're
   very gregarious and open,
   kind of like a Bob Martin, Uncle Bob. And then when they're
   offstage, they're a little bit more reserved,
   and soft-spoken, or maybe not necessarily Bob Martin. But
   so the
   point is, is that when you get on a stage, they're able to
   put on a persona,
   and then when they come back, they're able to be themselves
   again. Is that
   something you do, or do you feel a lot more like your
   personality on stage
   is the same as offstage, or is it melded? I definitely
   think that there's a
   change. That's also why sometimes I don't really know what
   I'm going to say when
   I'm on stage, because I sort of change into somebody who
   wants to be there and have attention
   and when I come down from the stage again, I'm just myself.
   Yeah, does it feel like kind of exhilarating, or a little
   bit like, "Oh, that was depleting"?
   No, I'm high about an hour after I've been on stage, and
   then I deflate.
   And then it's, "Oh, that was tiring." Yes, right. I think I
   use a lot of energy on it.
   Okay, and so the presentations here at GOTO Conf, who were
   you introducing? So in the
   morning introductions, I just share with Dave Thomas. I
   introduce half of them, and he
   introduces the other half of them, and now I'm track
   hosting also for some of
   the sessions. Like this afternoon, I'm track hosting for,
   for instance, Greg
   Young. Yesterday, I was track hosting for Michael Nygaard,
   Randy Shoup, and Jess Humble, so...
   What is track hosting? Oh, that means that you are hosting
   a track in the
   room, so all the speakers that are coming there are sort of
   your responsibility. You need
   to make sure that they're there, and you need to introduce
   them so they know when to start
   talking, and you need to help them stop talking when they
   should stop talking, and you get
   their slides for the website. So it's a little bit of an MC
  , kind of.
   It is. So, MC, I know.
   Yes. Well, thank you very much for taking the
   time to speak with me. I really appreciate it. Thank you.
   Oh, actually, you know what? I do want to ask one more
   thing.
   Okay. Is there, for somebody who's looking at presenting,
   and maybe coming to their first
   big conference... Yes.
   ...because you've experienced going from coming into a big
   conference, is there any
   particular advice or any thoughts you might think of that
   they might not be prepared for
   or maybe are overly prepared for? Anything that...
   You know, when you... Do you mean when you are accepted to
   go, or...?
   Yeah, like when you're going to go to a talk at a big
   conference that's, you know,
   100... well over 100 people, or a multi-day track, and it's
   going to be a bigger conference,
   you know, there's... What are maybe... I'll split that into
   two questions. What are some
   things that they should be prepared for, and what, if
   anything, is that they might be thinking
   that they're used to at a smaller venue that they...
   Okay. ...that won't translate well into a larger
   venue? Okay, exactly.
   It's a hard question. Yeah, but I could say that one thing
   is that
   sometimes you get shocked by the number of people, and you
   get nervous, and the thing
   that really works for me... Mm-hmm.
   ...is to rehearse at least the first three sentences, so
   that I know them by heart, really
   by heart, just rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing, so that
   even if I get very nervous when I
   get on stage, I sort of... I've got it down to an
   automation, and once you've started
   talking, normally you forget how many people that are there
  .
   Yeah, so that first moment... Yeah, that first moment is
   very important.
   Of course you should rehearse your whole presentation, but
   that first moment is really important,
   that you really say it out loud many times, and also if
   people are asking you a question
   from the audience... Mm-hmm.
   ...you have to remember to repeat the question, of course,
   so that everybody knows
   that you've understood the question correctly, and
   everybody has heard the question.
   Right. So that would be one of the things.
   Okay. And then don't listen to all the bad criticism
   you get. Yeah, try to turn it off a little bit.
   Yeah. Okay, well, not for real. Thank you very much.
   That was practice on the first time. Thank you very much
   for taking the time to speak
   with me. You're welcome.

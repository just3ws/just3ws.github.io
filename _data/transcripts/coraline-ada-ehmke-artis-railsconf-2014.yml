  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at RailsConf 2014,
   and I'm standing here with Coraline Emke, who gave a talk
   called Artisans and Apprentices.
   Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
   Of course.
   So can you tell me a little bit about your presentation?
   Sure. I've been involved with onboarding new developers,
   with bringing new people into our field for a number of
   years now, through mentorships, through training, through
   education, by being a teacher's assistant.
   And I really think that it's one of the most important
   problems that we have to solve right now as technologists,
   is how to bring new people into our community while
   preserving our community values, and making sure that they
   have the appropriate resources to become effective and
   happy with their careers.
   Okay, yeah, because I had worked with the talent group on
   it, and so I'm familiar with some of what you're talking
   about.
   Some of those things that you're dealing with when you're
   onboarding an employee can be a huge indicator of whether
   they're going to stick around.
   Right, and I think actually even before they come into
   their first job, the work that we do as a community to
   prepare them for entering the workforce, whether they go
   through a boot camp program, whether they go through a CS
   program, or if they're self-taught, the way that we present
   ourselves to them, we establish a baseline for what our
   expectations for them are.
   I think that's something we have to be very deliberate
   about.
   So when you say expectations, are you talking about
   strictly technical, or maybe cultural, or both?
   Absolutely both.
   Our culture will erode.
   The things that bring us to a particular open source
   community, whether it be Ruby or Python or what have you,
   is the image that the community portrays, and the way that
   it lives, the values that it professes to hold dear.
   If we're not very deliberate about passing those values on,
   that culture will erode, and the things that we love about
   a community.
   So things like RailsConf having the no-harassment policy,
   those are important things, or maybe I'm drifting a little
   bit from, or I should say, are they imparting lessons to
   people who are apprentices or artisans coming to RailsConf
   and saying, wow, RailsConf has this thing, that's obviously
  , even if it's subconscious, it's imparting that this is
   important.
   Actually, I never made that connection.
   I never made that connection before, but I'm really glad
   you bring it up, because I do work a lot with conferences
   and with people who work with conferences to establish good
   codes of conduct.
   What these are, in my talk, I talk about the fact that a
   boot camp situation where you're paid, you don't work for
   12 weeks, and you pay them $12,000, that draws from a very
   privileged class of people who can afford to not have a
   wage for that time, who can afford $12,000, who don't have
   families to support, and so on.
   That self-selects people who are of a privileged class, and
   in order to attract people who are different from the
   majority of software developers, people who are maybe from
   outside of your community, outside of your network, it's
   important to signal to them that they're welcome, and I
   think codes of conduct is their one mechanism by which you
   can signal to women and minorities and people of color and
   people on the LGBT spectrum that it's a safe place and that
   they're welcome and that there are consequences for people
   who violate the community norms.
   So you're here and you're presenting at Rails Conference,
   so it sounds like you do feel comfortable here and you feel
   like it's giving a positive vibe.
   Is this something you've seen other conferences adopting,
   or is this something that maybe some conferences are kind
   of, I'm not going to do this because maybe I'll upset our
   core audience?
   I absolutely have seen that play out, that discussion play
   out, and I took the code of conduct.
   I took the code of conduct pledge that Ash Dryden put
   together late last year.
   I will not speak at or attend a conference that does not
   have a comprehensive code of conduct, and a lot of people
   took that pledge.
   The people who disagree with it or who don't think it's a
   big deal are not the people that the code of conduct is
   there for.
   So if I'm somebody who's working in a community and I have
   a youth group or a conference, what are some of the things
   that I can do to be more aware or ensure that I'm not even
   under the influence of the community?
   I'm unaware of them, excluding people.
   I mean, if I look out at my user group and it's all a bunch
   of middle-aged white guys, is it just that's the area I'm
   in, or am I maybe doing something that, how can I become
   more aware of what I'm doing and evaluate whether or not
   the audience is just that's the demographic I'm in, or is
   there something I'm maybe doing to put up a barrier?
   I think that is absolutely the first step, is looking out
   at the people that you're associating with, and if they all
   look like you, there's a good chance that you're suffering
   from it.
   You have established relationships with people that you've
   worked with, people that you socialize with.
   It's not that you've done something wrong, it's that you
   haven't done all of the things that you could do to make
   your group inclusive and welcoming.
   And one of the ways you can do that is by promoting the
   fact that you are open and welcoming.

   they are able-bodied.

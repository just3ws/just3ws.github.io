  Hi it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here again at GoToConf
   2014 and I'm
   standing here with Adrian Colcroft who gave the keynote,
   the kickoff talk here
   at the conference. Thank you very much for taking the time
   to speak with me.
   Can you tell me a little bit about what your talk was about
   and and how you came
   to give that talk here at GoToConf? Sure, thanks for having
   me on this. The talk
   really came from, there's two pieces to it. The first part
   was about how to speed
   things up and the speed of innovation being very important
   and how to think
   about what is innovation and what is disruptive rather than
   what is kind of
   the incumbent sort of existing companies and the way they
   do things. And so
   there's this
   phrase that I kind of hinged it around which is, "It ain't
   what you know that
   messes you up, it's what you know that ain't so." It's a
   Will Rogers quote and a
   lot of the disruptions that happen in this
   industry happen because an incumbent figures out, "Okay, we
  're gonna, we have an
   idea, we're gonna, we know how to optimize for that idea."
   You build a business
   model around it and then you go off and build your business
  . And then somebody else noticed
   this is that one of your assumptions is no longer true. And
   you're optimizing for
   something that used to be really expensive but now it isn't
  . And then
   you, the disruptor basically takes advantage of this thing
   that
   everyone else assumes is a big expensive hard-to-do thing
   that has now
   become cheap and easy. So you end up wasting a lot of
   something and it looks
   horrifying to the incumbents, right? So they couldn't
   possibly do that, you know.
   But you end up disrupting the industries that way and there
  's a number of examples that
   of that that I went through. Yeah, because the first thing
   I think about is
   is data databases, you know, that we have Oracle and MS SQL
   that they're
   Microsoft, they have these big monolithic products. But
   then along comes open
   source products like MySQL and Postgres which are now
   running huge operations.
   And before, I mean, they're still incredibly intensely
   difficult problems they're solving,
   but they're able to take and disrupt the business of Post
  gre, I mean, of Oracle.
   So yeah, so really the open source itself is one of those,
   the concept of open
   source, the concept that the best software you could buy is
   the stuff you
   get for free that's built by a community is something that
   is sort of alien to
   the traditional enterprise software businesses where you
   have a
   product manager who comes up with an idea and then they go
   away and work on
   it for a few years and then they pop out with the product
   and try and sell it
   to you for a lot of money. And historically that was how
   you bought
   stuff because it was the best stuff you could get and these
   companies knew
   were the places that knew best how to build things. And I
   worked for Sun
   Microsystems for a long time and, you know, part of that
   process. But what
   really happened was the best things you can get now are
   free and they are built
   by communities and the best engineers don't work at those
   enterprise
   companies, they work for end users. So, you know, the most
   interesting scale
   available reliable software now is coming from open source
   projects and I
   highlighted a few of those in the talk. So that's one
   disruption. Another one I
   mentioned was solid-state disk replacing spinning raster to
   traditional
   disks and that the way that that has completely taken what
   used to be a it's
   a multi-trillion dollar business or whatever it is in
   storage and if you
   look at the way that a Cassandra based deployment on AWS is
   there are no storage admin
   there's no SAN, there's some SSD inside an instance and
   that's all there is. So
   the person managing it is probably a Java distributed
   systems programmer,
   developer type of person with a little bit of operational
   experience to
   automate how to keep that thing up and running. But there's
   no layers and
   layers of SAN fabrics and storage arrays have completely
   disappeared so
   it's not just that you disrupt the product, you make the
   entire product
   category disappear. That's one of the most disruptive
   things that's going on right now.
   I have to think about when you're talking about trying to
   change the
   mindset of people who've built their own business, their
   entire business on a
   certain set of assumptions and looking at more about just a
   human quirk there.
   I'm just reading an article about how people who have
   deeply held beliefs that
   they've internalized into their own persona, their own
   personality, and
   that's the only way to get them to change their thoughts.
   You can't just say
   here's a fact that you what you know is wrong. You have to
   just change literally
   the way they think and address their personality. Is that
   something that
   when you think about when we're dealing with these
   companies that have
   these deeply embedded, entrenched I should say, not
   embedded, but deeply
   entrenched processes like this is how we build software
   because this is how
   things are done, this is how we develop products, and how
   we can apply
   them. Do you talk about a little bit how we can approach
   those
   kind of thought processes and address them and work within
   them?
   Sure, so I talked about a few other things. I had a whole
   hour, so
   there was a lot of things I covered. One of them was
   continuous
   delivery as another way of disruptively speeding things up.
   The
   assumption you're making there is that you can move a lot
   quicker, but
   what it really comes down to is the
   DevOps kind of approach where you're actually taking away
   the handoffs
   between teams. So everyone knows that developers have to
   stay in
   development and operations people run their code and they
  're different kinds
   of people and they optimize for different things. But if
   you reorganize
   so that you put them in the same organization, you blend
   those
   responsibilities and you automate everything. It's not just
   that you create
   a DevOps team, it's that you actually have to reorganize
   your company and have a cultural change.
   So DevOps is in many ways a cultural problem and companies
   that get over that
   are the ones that are doing well. So somebody tweeted a few
   days ago, "Is DevOps
   ready for the enterprise?" That was a question. My response
   was it's the other
   way around. The enterprises that are ready for DevOps are
   the ones that are
   going to disrupt the enterprises that aren't.
   Oh okay, so they're going to just knock out the ones that
   aren't.
   Yeah, it's much harder to compare.
   If you're running, if every time you do a product release
   it takes you a year
   to get it to customers and your competitors doing it in a
   few weeks and
   learning and you're being able to run rings around you. So
   that is the sort of
   existential challenge that a lot of companies are getting
   through right
   now. And the other big change is that software used to be a
   little thing on
   the side for a lot of companies and now it's central. It's
   central to everything
   they do. It's central to the way they do marketing and
   sales and build things and
   the way they support customers and the way they deliver
   products. Internet of
   Things is just one aspect of that. But what you're seeing
   is this whole
   software eats the world, driving people. And now it's
   central, they have to get
   good at it. And so they're looking to the big enterprise
   companies, the big web
   companies as examples of how to do that. Netflix is one
   example. It's a very, very
   rapid development process. Google, Twitter, Facebook, all
   of those companies are
   leading in this space.
   And the enterprises around the world are trying to figure
   out, how do we learn,
   what do we learn from them and how do we adopt it?
   Yeah, oh sorry, go ahead. So that was kind of the first
   part of the talk. The second
   part was some more practical things about what that
   actually means in
   practice for a developer. There's some techniques and I was
   trying to
   make it a little bit more hands-on and a bit more detailed.
   So the talk was kind
   of a little in two sections.
   Yeah, the reason that what I was about to say is that I
   interviewed Bill Scott,
   who's with PayPal, and he talked about how it was fresh off
   of the acquisition
   of Braintree and how PayPal is trying to rethink their
   entire business process.
   And they were looking at companies like Braintree who were
   able to deliver
   these things. And a lot of people in the press that I heard
   were looking very
   skeptically on PayPal acquiring Braintrust, thinking, "Okay
  , well I'm
   Braintree, well that's going to bust the Braintrust at Bra
  intree." That's what I thought.
   Say that 10 times. But when he described it, they said, "No
  , we're looking at how
   they do things and really trying to figure out how to bring
   those into our
   operations, in a nutshell."
   Sure. I worked with Bill Scott when he was at Netflix and I
   actually worked at eBay, PayPal, back before I joined
   Netflix.
   So I get some of the challenges there. You've got a
   successful business and
   it's working and then you have to, you know, PayPal has
   this big challenge from other
   financial processing stuff like Square and Stripe and
   whatever. Those companies
   are, you know, we're more agile and PayPal's trying to
   respond to that. And
   they're doing a pretty good job and what Bill's doing there
   is good work to
   move them strongly in that direction. It's good to see. If
   you were to go and
   just flip a bit and everybody's head was in your talk and
   have them take
   home at least one factoid or one idea, what would you like
   to have impressed
   upon them the most?
   I think from sort of questioning the assumptions you've got
  , right? Look at
   the way you're operating, what you're doing and what
   assumptions you're
   making. And if you're assuming something and optimizing for
   it and then you look
   at the trend for that thing and, you know, it's either
   going to suddenly stop being
   true or over time it's going to stop being true, make those
   explicit and get out ahead of those
   examples. One of the key things that Netflix does, it tries
   to lean into
   the future. If there's a trend towards cloud, they'll get
   in early and they'll
   dive in and they'll learn how to get good at it before it's
   really ready for
   mass consumption. And that is a very powerful technique for
   learning how to
   take full advantage. So once it becomes mass adoption, you
  're already well
   optimized for it, so you have that advantage.

  Hi, it's Mike again with UGtastic. I'm sitting down with
   James Edward Gray, who is known for Shades of Grey, the
   Ruby Rogues, and also if you've used his faster CSV library
   in 1.8, and now it's part of the standard lib in Ruby 1.9,
   not, well, just Ruby 1.9.
   But thanks for taking a moment to sit down, James. I
   appreciate it. Can you tell me a little bit about how you
   got involved with Ruby?
   Yeah, it was a long time ago. I think I entered the
   community in summer of 2004 or something like that, and I'd
   just kind of gotten off of a job and, you know, went into
   that cycle of learning new things, and I grabbed a copy of
   the programming Ruby and decided I'd teach myself a new
   language and kind of got stuck and never left.
   What were you doing before Ruby?
   I'm Java certified. I did that for several years. I spent a
   lot of time in the Perl community working there. The
   project I came off of just before getting into the Ruby
   community was a big Perl site using CGI and all kinds of
   crazy stuff.
   So you've kind of really embraced the Ruby community, and
   it seems to have been a lot of fun for you. What was it
   about Ruby?
   It was pretty early on, because 2004 was, I mean, it hadn't
   just come out, but that was pre-rails.
   Yeah, it was really early. It was easy to get hooked in the
   community back then. It was a very small, tight-knit group
   of people. We had basically one mailing list where most of
   our communication happened, and you would literally be
   posting questions and getting answers from people like Dave
   Thomas and stuff like that.
   Yeah, it was really early. It was easy to get hooked in the
   community back then. It was a very small, tight-knit group
   of people. We had basically one mailing list where most of
   our communication happened, and you would literally be
   posting questions and getting answers from people like Dave
   Thomas and stuff like that.
   So I was just on the tail end of that era, and got kind of
   sucked in that way.
   Okay. And then you created the Faster CSV library. What
   drove that?
   It was an accident, actually. They were talking on the Ruby
   core mailing list about how the CSV library was so slow,
   and people were trying to analyze why it was slow.
   Really, it was...
   It wasn't any particular fault of the library so much, just
   that it did a lot of work in a really tight loop, calling a
   bunch of methods and stuff, which in Ruby is pretty slow.
   And people were talking about ways to speed it up, and just
   a few weeks before that, I had read Mastering Regular Exp
  ression or something like that.
   Right.
   And so I said, well, you can do it with one regular
   expression. And everybody's like, no, you can't. And so I
   went and pulled it out of the book and put it in the
   mailing list discussion, and a bunch of people threw really
   nasty examples at it that it didn't handle well. So I kept
   tweaking it and tweaking it to seeing if I could get it to
   do all of it, and I wrote this kind of tiny parser using
   primarily that one expression.
   And then a few other things to handle some gnarly edge
   cases, and that actually ended up being the faster CSV core
   for a long time. Eventually, somebody came along and rewr
  ote the parser not to use a regular expression, but that was
   the start of it.
   Yeah. And then, I mean, what was the process that went from
   being an external Ruby gem to being part of the standard
   lib? What did you have... Did you have to pay a fee? Did
   you have to sign a license agreement?
   Yeah, yeah, sign away all my... No, actually, there was
   discussion once faster CSV had been around for a while.
   There was discussion multiple times about, you know, should
   we replace the library and the standard core? And I think
   most people were positive to the idea in that, you know, we
   wanted a faster library and stuff.
   And, you know, we didn't want to break backwards
   compatibility. And I had a compatibility mode where it
   would behave like CSV, but it wasn't perfect. There were
   some cases where it couldn't do the right thing. So that
   was discussed for a long time, and nobody ever really came
   to a decision on that, which stalled it getting in.
   I was tired of it not being in there and wrote a pretty imp
  assioned plea to, you know, this is ridiculous. We have a
   much better choice. Can we just put it in? And they were
   decided... At that point, it was discussed one more time,
   and it was decided, all right, compatibility be damned. We
  'll just switch over.
   Yeah. Well, I remember upgrading from standard CSV to
   faster CSV and then migrating to 1.9 and had no problems. I
   mean, but then again, maybe our case wasn't that exotic.
   1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it
   in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework
  ed extensively because of encodings, which encoding, you
   know, your data is in matters how you find things like a
   quote and a comma, right?
   1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it
   in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework
  ed extensively because when I brought it in, 1.9 had the M17
  n engine, right?
   Yeah, we actually drove some bug fixes in Ruby at that time
  . When I was fixing CSV, I would figure out a lot of
   encoding stuff, and I would find some kind of bizarre edge
   cases and then post them to the list, and that actually
   ended up fixing certain bugs in Ruby.
   Oh, okay. So because you were actually driving a use case
   for a lot of these encoding issues.
   1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it
   in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework
  ed extensively because when I brought it in, 1.9 had the M17
  n engine, right?
   Yeah, so because you were actually driving a use case for a
   lot of these encoding issues.
   And that drove me crazy, so I wrote those articles that you
   mentioned on my blog.
   And so you're jumping over to some of the more social
   aspects, not just the code, but the Ruby Rogues. You're on
   there. You're a regular contributor to the Ruby Rogues
   podcast. How did you get involved with that?
   I'd had an idea from some other podcasts I listened to that
   had panel discussions, and I thought, man, it'd be really
   cool.
   Wouldn't it be cool to do that in Ruby someday? And I guess
   Chuck had had pretty much the same idea, and I can't
   remember who mentioned it first, but one of us mentioned it
   on Twitter.
   Wouldn't it be cool to have a panel of Ruby discussions,
   and whichever one didn't mention it, the other one was like
  , I've been thinking the same thing.
   And so we kind of started trading some emails over it and
   put together the original panel and just started doing it.
   And it was just something we did for fun in our spare time.
   But then it got popular pretty quick, really. And so we got
   lots of feedback, you know, your audio sucks, and things
   like that.
   Yeah, I hope eventually to get that kind of feedback.
   Right, yeah.
   Because I'll be like, yeah, they all suck.
   Yeah, when you get a bunch of listeners, they definitely
   bug you about it quick.
   Yeah.
   And, you know, we had some people leave and some people
   come in, and then we just kind of got lucky in getting a
   team that really gelled eventually, you know, and played
   well off of each other.
   And I think that's mostly what led to its success.
   Yeah, I listened to quite a few, and Ruby 5 and Ruby Rogues
   are two that I can tolerate listening to in the background.
   Because sometimes it's almost like listening a little bit
   to, like, I used to listen to talk radio.
   And the banter, it's not too heavy, but, you know, you can
   kind of tune it out, and it's like a conversation in the
   background.
   Right.
   But it's fun.
   And that kind of is going to provide my segue into the next
   topic is I joked with Avdi when I interviewed him about
   what kind of was the impetus for me to reach out to him was
   listening to the episode, and it was just this kind of ban
  ter you guys were having.
   In the beginning of the show about stand-up chairs, stand-
  up desks.
   And I was like, I didn't know at the time that you, you
   know, you were in a wheelchair.
   And somebody said something about a stand-up desk, and you
   said something like, oh, I don't use one, and I don't know
   who it said.
   But they're like, well, why, James?
   And, you know, and then you guys all laughed.
   And, you know, and I said to Avdi that that's, you know,
   that's a very.
   Positive banter because you can't just have that one unless
   you guys were all friends and knew each other well.
   But it is germane to the technical community and being out
   and speaking and going to user groups and conferences and
   things like that.
   Has that been something that's, well, what has it been like
  ?
   I hate that question, but what has it been like going to
   conferences?
   In a wheelchair?
   It's not, you know, it's not too bad.
   There was some time early when I was first in the Ruby
   community.
   You know, it was a very small group, so I was probably the
   first one in a wheelchair in the community.
   And there, just at that time, there wasn't awareness.
   And there, so they would just book conferences in certain
   locations without thinking about things.
   Like accessibility.
   And there were a couple of early instances where some of
   the conferences were not in good accessible locations.
   And that wasn't anybody's fault.
   Like I said, it was just a lack of awareness.
   And when it was brought up, you know, everybody felt
   terrible and all of that.
   But being in the community pretty early on, that made
   everybody kind of start putting it as a bullet point.
   On things you need to look for in a conference location,
   you know.
   And so that problem resolved itself really quickly,
   actually.
   And really, the harder part for me is just, it's not easy
   to travel with a big electric wheelchair.
   Especially if you're going to take a plane.
   It's very inconvenient.
   So when I fly, I switch to a manual wheelchair, which is
   much easier to get around with.
   When you're flying.
   But at the same time, it reduces my mobility a lot.
   So because of that, I just don't tend to go to a lot of far
  away conferences unless I make it a very special thing and
   do.
   So I tend to stick to the conferences around me.
   And I live basically right in the middle of the U.S.
   So I usually do the more central conferences.
   And so I don't get out to some of the big ones on the coast
   very often, though.
   So, you know, Josh Susser keeps threatening to drag me to
   Goguruko.
   And I would like to make it there someday.
   But every now and then, I'll make a special exception.
   I went to Japan for Ruby Taigi one time.
   But when going there, then I was traveling internationally.
   So you had things like, you know, how is the accessibility
   in Japan to consider.
   So I talked to Matt beforehand, and we had a discussion.
   And he told me it was really pretty good in Japan's modern
   cities.
   So to stay in the big, nice cities, but, you know, to avoid
   the little towns, which is pretty similar to here in the U.
  S., actually.
   So I stayed in big places like Kyoto and Tokyo and did that
  .
   And then just recently, this last year, I attended Aloha
   Ruby Conf.
   So I flew down to Hawaii and did that.
   And it was a great time.
   Yeah.
   So it is something that you communicate to organizers.
   Hey, if you're going to have me come speak, just heads up.
   Well, nowadays, I don't really have to do that anymore.
   You know, it seems to just, it's something we think about
   now.
   And I've seen other people in wheelchairs at conferences
   now.
   So, you know, we're a big, sprawling, worldly community
   that needs to be aware of everybody's needs.
   So, and luckily, the good thing is, you know, once you
   reach a certain point, we're a huge community.
   You know, Ruby Conf limits the attendance and still gets
   800 to 1,000, you know.
   So when you have to put that many people in a place, you
   typically need a very modern hotel or convention center.
   And those kinds of places are always accessible.
   Yeah, they've already got that handled.
   Right.
   Yeah, because...
   It is interesting that as I'm doing these interviews, I'm
   learning more about people's experiences in a community
   that aren't necessarily young, white males.
   Right.
   But even young, white male, like yourself, you know, there
  's all different varieties of ability and accessibility.
   So it's kind of been interesting for me.
   I actually didn't come from the .NET.
   I mean, I can't...
   I came from a .NET community for 10 years and then started
   into Ruby.
   But in the last few years, it seems like it has grown.
   There's been some serious pains with isms in the community.
   But it seems like we're coming out on the other side of
   that with a much more enlightened community or the birth p
  angs of an enlightened community.
   And it's kind of interesting that it's not been something
   that's been enforced from the outside or a government
   mandate or some kind of regulation.
   It's been largely grassroots, the people in the community
   saying, hey, this is not acceptable or, hey, this has to be
   better.
   Yeah, I think that's really improving.
   I mean, like I said, I think now anybody who plans a Ruby
   conference is, you know, at least factors it into their
   thinking, you know, it should be accessible.
   You know, I have people tell me things like, we'd love to
   get you to come out to our conference sometimes.
   Oh, and I've checked.
   There's a ramp to get on stage, right?
   You know.
   Yeah.
   Things like that, you know.
   So I think it's in people's minds now and they factor it
   into their thinking.
   And just attending the conferences, I'm noticing how much
   more diverse they're getting.
   And, yeah, that makes me really proud of us as a community.
   So, you know, a lot of people in the Ruby community seem to
   be also, it has hit a certain stage where a lot of the, it
   seems like a lot of the earlier people who adopted it are
   now starting to look at other technologies.
   Is there anything for James?
   Are you looking at Clojure or anything like that?
   I play with lots of other things.
   You know, Erlang I've played with quite a bit.
   I haven't got around to Clojure or Scala yet, but they're
   on my list, you know, to get to eventually.
   Actually, in recent years, I've been more trying to focus
   on complementary things.
   Like, you know, a lot of people have been trying to focus
   on complementary things.
   A lot of people will go learn Clojure and, you know, use
   that a bunch.
   But I've been trying to do things like, I actually sat down
   at one point and finally sat down and learned Bash, you
   know, the shell.
   I just, you know, all those years I could use it a little,
   but never really sat down and read through a book on it and
   learned how to write loops in it or things like that.
   And, boy, that was phenomenal for my productivity.
   Like, I can't tell.
   I can't tell you how valuable it was, actually.
   I mean, I understand now when a process works, what's going
   on, you know, and what are the rules.
   And it's funny how much that helps.
   And so I've been learning more complementary things.
   I'm a big regular expression nut, and I enjoy digging down
   into the guts of Aniruma and building really complicated
   regular expressions to understand how the engine works and
   things.
   So I've been focusing more on complementary things.
   So I've been focusing more on complementary stuff and less
   on totally, you know, I'm going to switch to this other
   language kind of stuff.
   So you're going to come up with a Bash quiz book?
   No, I don't think my Bash is that good.
   You need to talk to somebody like Wayne Siegwin for that.
   He's really great at that kind of stuff.
   Yeah, and so just to kind of bring us to the tail end, you
  've written a few books.
   But the one that was kind of the most interesting for me
   was the Ruby quiz.
   I've not actually read it formally.
   I've sat down and looked through it.
   But it was interesting that it was more of like, here's
   some kind of neat things that maybe you wouldn't expect.
   And what was the impetus for creating that book?
   So when I came to the Ruby community, I came from the Perl
   community.
   And about the only thing I missed from Perl was Perl had
   Perl's quiz of the week back then running.
   And it was run by Mark Jason Dominus.
   And it was a little different from the Ruby quiz.
   It had like a beginner's level and then expert level each
   week and stuff.
   But I really missed doing that quiz and seeing all the
   solutions and stuff like that.
   So I created the Ruby quiz to fill that void because I
   missed it.
   And I ran it for quite a while.
   I can't remember how long.
   And Dave Thomas.
   At that time was, you know, really getting that pragmatic
   bookshelf going.
   And that was when they started producing a lot of Ruby
   books.
   And he came to me and said, would you like to take some of
   the best of the Ruby quizzes and turn them into a book?
   Okay.
   So that was how it happened.
   And he admitted at the time, he's all, you know, it
   probably won't be a great seller, you know, because it's
   kind of a niche thing and stuff.
   But he said that, you know, it's a neat topic and will be
   something fun to have.
   And the line ups.
   Yeah, it was always on the shelves at any of the consult
  ancies I was at.
   But it's 1.8.
   Is there an update coming for 1.9?
   No, they recently took that book out of print.
   So I think it's all done.
   I did the Ruby quiz for three years and then kind of set it
   aside.
   It was a huge time commitment because, you know, you had to
   have problems ready to go.
   And I wrote the problem each week.
   And then also I had to, as problems came in, I had to dig
   through the code enough that I could figure it out and talk
   about it, you know.
   So that took me some time.
   And then I wrote up the summary each week.
   So all in all, it took me about eight hours a week, I would
   say, to just run it and sometimes more.
   It was a complicated problem or something.
   So eventually I was like, this is a lot of fun, but I'm
   going to have to set this aside if I'm going to be able to
   do other things.
   And there have been some people who've ran brief stints in
   the interim, but nothing like the original run.
   Okay.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to sit down
   and chat with me.
   So thank you very much.
   You have a good day.
   Absolutely.
   Thanks.

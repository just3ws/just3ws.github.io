  Hi, it's Mike with uTastic. I'm here at GoToConf 2014. I'm
   sitting here with Richard Lee, who is a
   contributor to the OpenStack project, particularly the HEAT
   project, which is, well, I'll explain
   what that is. Well, first, thank you very much for taking
   the time to speak with me. So, what is the
   HEAT project, and also, what is OpenStack, and how did you
   get involved with contributing to it?
   So, OpenStack is the platform that allows you to basically
   host your own cloud. So, it's especially
   useful for companies that host, like, internal cloud, maybe
   your IT group, to allow provisioning
   without going towards, you know, external cloud providers.
   So, I guess the HEAT project in particular
   is the thing that kind of orchestrates everything. It's the
   orchestration engine. So, within OpenStack,
   there's a service.
   It's for compute. So, you can launch your compute nodes for
   load balancers, databases. And HEAT is the
   thing that kind of binds it all together. It's, okay, I
   want to launch a load balancer, and I want
   to make sure that load balancer is connected to my server,
   and my server is connected to my
   database, and provides kind of the whole mapping of it all.
   Is HEAT an acronym, or is that a code word?
   That is, as far as I know, that's just the name of the
   project.
   Just the name of the project. Just project, codename, HEAT.
   Yeah.
   So, how did you end up contributing to that project? Is
   that something you
   were doing already with ThoughtWorks, or somewhere else
   before?
   So, I kind of got dropped into it just from project work. I
  'm actually previously
   working primarily in Ruby on Rails, and then just started
   going into Python. OpenStack's
   pretty much entirely in Python. And just from project work,
   I started working on OpenStack,
   got jumped into the HEAT project, and that's where I am now
  .
   Okay. So, you didn't have, like, a particular passion for
   this specific topic. It was just,
   you saw an opportunity.
   You saw an opportunity to contribute and do something, and
   you've come from being more of an app dev now to
   being, working in this open source. Has that been a little
   bit of a challenge in how you think, or how
   you approach problems?
   It's been very interesting, because there's just a lot of
   pieces that I just didn't think about before,
   especially, like, Ruby on Rails. It was very easy to kind
   of ignore the entire Ops-y world.
   It was like, oh, I'll just build my app, and I'll throw it
   on Heroku. And now, it's very interesting
   seeing the way that, I guess, deployments, in general, are
   moving. With all these interesting tools, along with OpenSt
  ack,
   there's, you know, like, Solve, Docker, all these different
   kind of things that you can use and leverage.
   And it's, the deployment world is very interesting, and
   OpenStack, I think, is going to be a big player in that.
   Right. So, it's an interesting problem that, when you were
   coming over to Python, though, you know,
   you described you were part of the Ruby community. You've
   been exposed now to Python community, and the DevOps
   community.
   Has that been interesting, getting more exposure to a
   broader community?
   So, it's been, it was very strange jumping in from Ruby to
   Python.
   Right.
   I think, when I think of the Ruby community, at some point,
   I was like, you know, I think I should start, maybe start
   writing a blog,
   or, you know, trying to record my experiences, just for my
   own knowledge. And, in the Ruby community, everyone has
   blogged about everything.
   Fifty times, you can find everything written in every
   different way, and, when I jumped into the Python community
  ,
   it felt more like, it was very much more academic, and it
   was very, very document-based.
   Very, you know, you're trying to learn something, go read
   the docs for this library, for that library,
   and there weren't as many people writing about, this is how
   you use, you know, these two libraries that are very
   commonly used together.
   Right.
   This is how you connect it. So, that was, that was
   definitely a driver in me, to start, like, writing a blog,
   and, kind of, providing, I don't know, more useful
   information, the very personal
   experience of, this is how you use things.
   Right.
   And then, the DevOps community has been just mind-blowing
   for me.
   Right.
   It's just something that's not, something that I've had to
   think about, so far.
   Right. So, what was it, in particular, that, kind of, was
   new for you, when you started looking at that community?
   Within DevOps, it's just, how many different ways you can
   do a deployment.
   Yeah, there's a lot of different ones.
   Just even, you know, a lot of people, I think the, I don't
   know, the prevalence of Chef, and PubSense,
   and Puppet, have been big in deployments, and then people
   are starting to shift to, I was talking to Randy Shoop, who
   was saying, their deployment process was, they write Puppet
   Manifests, and then they use Packer to create an AMI, and
   then they deploy the AMIs, and then I know the people that
   are using Docker for their deployments, and then there's
   this key project for how you, you know, orchestrate it all,
   you know, similar to, I don't know, other options out there
  , like, Amazon's CloudFormation is out there, and there's so
   many different ways that you can launch what you want to
   launch.
   We're going to need a dev, devopsops.
   Dev, kind of thing, so that way we can start to put these
   operation devops tools, so we can deploy those, so that way
   we can eventually deploy an application.
   So, if people wanted to learn more about OpenStack, and the
   Heat project, where can they go, and, or check out your
   work?
   So, you can definitely just go to the OpenStack website,
   the wiki's very, very full-fledged, and especially if you
   just go onto the OpenStack IRC channels, there's one for
   every different project, for Nova, Heat, all the different
   ones.
   And people are very active, very, very willing to talk and
   converse.
   Okay, great.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak,
   appreciate it.

  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2015 and I
  'm sitting here with
   Dimitri who gave a talk about the data grid, well, bigger
   than the data grid.
   Beyond the data grid. Beyond the data grid with Apache Ign
  ite. Well, first I want to say
   thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me
   and you can tell me a
   little bit about what your presentation was about and what
   is this Apache
   Ignite product. All right, thank you Mike. So yeah, I want
   you to notice I'm
   wearing an Apache Ignite t-shirt, first of all, so it's
   very cool. So whenever you
   see green t-shirts, I want you to know it's Apache Ignite.
   So I just gave a talk
   about Apache Ignite. So it's an Apache project, currently
   undergoing
   incubation process at Apache, but I'm getting a feeling it
  's gonna graduate
   pretty soon, probably within a couple of months. And what
   it is, it's a memory data
   fabric and essentially you use Apache Ignite whenever you
   face performance or
   scalability problems within your application. And at that
   point you decide to
   introduce an in-memory architecture, you want to cache a
   lot of data. You're gonna
   be faced with quite a few use cases, but a lot of them are
   common and we see it
   for every project that moves in memory. For example, you
   are going to have some
   clustering, you are going to have some scale out,
   horizontal scalability issues,
   you are going to probably want to cache data in memory,
   maybe partition or shard
   data in memory, and you probably want to transact on that
   data or maybe query
   that data. You may want to stream that data into the system
   or continuously
   ingest large amounts of data into the system and use
   streaming,
   maybe computing using distributed MapReduce, or for joint
   type APIs. So all
   of those components are available within Apache Ignite in-
  memory data fabric. So
   from the get-go, we wanted Apache Ignite to
   become a one-point solution for most of the in-memory use
   cases, and that's
   why we cover most of these use cases. However, the project
   is still very simple
   to use. It comes as one zip file. You just unzip it off
   your go. It uses all the
   standard APIs, probably you're most familiar with in Java,
   like maps, queues,
   sets, most of the concurrent Java Util concurrent APIs are
   also ported to
   Apache Ignite, ThreadPool, distributed executor service.
   All of those standard
   APIs are still used within Apache Ignite. So is Apache Ign
  ite a database competitor to
   a NoSQL database, or is it a layer that sits between
   applications and
   persistent data stores? That's a good question actually. So
   the answer is it's
   probably not a simple yes or no answer, because if you look
   at distributed cache
   within Apache Ignite, it is a key value store. So from that
   standpoint, you can
   think about it from a NoSQL standpoint, because you're
   working with basic Java
   objects. It's a key value store. However, Ignite has full
   SQL capabilities, and it
   allows you to index those, index inside of those objects.
   For example, your class
   names become tables, your fields inside of the classes
   become columns, and from
   there, and then you can create indexes in memory, and you
   can start querying it
   using standard SQL. So from one side, you can think about
   it as NoSQL, but it does
   provide SQL. It's SQL for NoSQL. SQL for NoSQL, there you
   go, that's a good way to put it. What does it provide, like
   a
   way to write back to persistence, or is it always only in
   memory? Actually, it does.
   It does provide, it does automatically write through to a
   persistent store, so if you
   have like an Oracle database or MySQL database already
   installed, Ignite will
   automatically integrate with that data store, automatically
   will detect all the
   indexes and put them in memory, or if you can also
   integrate it, put it on top of
   NoSQL disk-based databases like Mongo, React, Couchbase, or
   Cassandra for that matter, and it will
   also work on top of those as well. So it sounds like an
   extremely advanced caching
   layer that provides some direct query capabilities that you
   can save a call to
   the actual persistent on-disk databases. That sounds about
   right for the data
   grid portion. However, as I mentioned, Ignite is a fabric.
   Data grid and distributed
   caching is just one component, and it probably is the
   biggest component within
   Ignite, and that's where most of the people actually will
   use.
   But there's also streaming of data, there's also sliding
   window support,
   there's also distributed map reduce for joint kind of
   computations, so it
   provides a lot more than just that. But yeah, from a data
   grid standpoint, it's a
   fairly feature-rich project. Okay, and I'm going to ask you
   to just move a little bit. The project
   itself, I mean, how did you go about, is it something that
   you kind of cooked up
   from projects you were working on or some thesis? Where did
   the idea come to exist?
   All right, so actually I'm one of the co-founders of GridG
  ain systems. So we
   started out probably seven or eight years ago, and that
   time we wanted, we had
   a dream of creating this easy-to-use grid computing system.
   And we started from
   compute grid, and probably three years down the road we
   added data grid
   capabilities to it. And GridGain actually always had an
   open-source component, open-source version, and also there
   was an
   enterprise version. And in September of last year we
   decided to donate code to Apache
   Software Foundation. So it started going through incubation
   in Apache, and we are,
   I'm hoping, approaching the graduation in Apache as well.
   So what is the process? I mean, when you
   have an idea and you want to spin out an open-source
   project, do you just, did you
   go straight to Apache? Or was it that you had a project
   that you released and
   Apache contacted you and said, "Hey, let's pull this in."
   How did that, how did you end up
   with Apache then? So, well, I mean, there are two parts to
   the question.
   We wanted to join Apache because we wanted to grow
   community around
   open-source projects. So once you join Apache, you become
   part of this Apache
   process, what they call an Apache way, which is very
   community friendly. It
   introduces all sorts of outside contributions. So right now
  , believe it or
   not, we have, it used to be only GridGain commuters, we
   probably have more
   outside contributors working on Ignite than from the side
   of GridGain. So you
   get community growth. But however, Apache does not pull the
   code in. It
   will take your code, it will take your project and make
   sure you grow community
   around it, make sure you work with it the open-source way.
   But it will not
   take the code. You're still managing it. So you're still
   responsible for the project development.
   But it's just that it's kind of sold through the Apache
   marketplace. No, it's actually more
   of an Apache way. I mean, that's what it's called. It's
   Apache way, which is very open
   everything. All the discussions happen in the open. All the
   tickets happen in the
   open. All the design discussions and future of the project
   is all in the open
   and everybody is equal. It doesn't belong to one person. It
   belongs to the
   community now. Okay, and when you describe you're in an
   incubation phase, how
   do you go from incubation and what's the difference between
   incubation and being,
   well, not an incubation? Top-level project, you graduate.
   So the difference would be
   that, from a product standpoint, there's a very little
   difference. From an Apache
   standpoint, you have to, first of all, license compliance.
   You have to only have certain
   allowed licenses in your project, like definitely Apache 2.
  0 is allowed as a license. There's
   BSD license and MIT licenses are allowed. Then you have to
   have a well-oiled build procedure,
   well-oiled community process set up within Apache.
   So once you actually show that you can work with an open-
  source community and follow this
   kind of path, at that point you're ready to graduate. And
   usually that happens when
   you do like two or three releases under Apache. So we're
   currently on two. I think
   after the third one we will be ready to graduate. We're
   already complying. We're
   already embracing the Apache way. Okay, well thank you very
   much for taking the
   time to speak with me and for supporting open-source. Thank
   you. Thanks.

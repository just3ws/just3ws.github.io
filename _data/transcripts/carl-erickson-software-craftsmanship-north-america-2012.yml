  Carl Erickson, who is the CEO of Atomic Object,\r\n singular, not plural, and he's
  working on a project\r\n called BitCamp, where he's working with\r\n middle school
  girls so that way eventually they can become\r\n part of the tech community. Can
  you tell me a little bit more about\r\n what is exactly BitCamp? Sure. The first
  time we did BitCamp was in\r\n 2006, Michael, and we did it because we recognized
  there were\r\n very few women who are studying computer science, and therefore very
  few\r\n women in the field as software developers. We wanted to try to do something
  about\r\n that, but as a university professor before I started Atomic, I recognized
  that\r\n when you start thinking about that issue in freshman of\r\n college year,
  that's too late. So we wanted to go back earlier\r\n and we wanted to start getting
  girls excited and showing them\r\n what's possible and what a life of being a programmer\r\n
  is like, a work life of being a programmer, but when they're still young enough\r\n
  to not sort of have made up their mind that they can't do that or they're not\r\n
  interested in that or that's boring or unexciting or whatever. And that seems to
  be middle school.\r\n They seem to get turned off somewhere around middle school.\r\n
  From females in my family that I've spoken with, they think that\r\n it's kind of
  a boys thing, that it's\r\n just sitting down and looking at a computer.\r\n Right,
  it's no collaboration, it's a solo sport. You put your little headphones in and
  you go into your little cubicle and they throw food over there and out comes code.\r\n
  And our office environment is so much the antithesis of that, and our projects are
  so team oriented, that honestly collaboration and communication are at least as
  important, those skills, as software development skills.\r\n So I suspect if anything,
  women might actually have a natural advantage in that kind of environment.\r\n So
  with working with the young girls, is there a difference in the approach that you
  have, working with young females versus young males?\r\n So we've never done anything,
  we've never done anything with middle school kids.\r\n My daughter at the time was
  14, and so I knew about 14 year old girls.\r\n But we haven't done anything formally
  teaching wise, and I've never taught kids that young.\r\n So we decided that we
  wanted to try to give them a little bit of an overview.\r\n So we decided that we
  wanted to try to give them a little bit of an overview.\r\n So we decided that we
  wanted to try to give them a little bit of an overview.\r\n So we decided that we
  wanted to try to give them a little bit of an overview.\r\n So we decided that we
  wanted to try to give them a little bit of an overview.\r\n So we decided that we
  wanted to try to give them a little bit of an overview.\r\n So we decided that we
  wanted to try to give them a little bit of an overview.\r\n And I was a professor,
  so I had this perspective on some hands on exercises, some simulations, some doing
  practical things, as well as some lecture.\r\n And we put BitCamp together out of
  a one day experience with plenty of snacks and lunch and some fun in between.\r\n
  We didn't tailor it one way or other gender wise, and we tried to appeal to lots
  of different ways of learning.\r\n And we made darn sure that they were paired up
  when they were working together.\r\n And we made darn sure that they were paired
  up when they were working together.\r\n And we made darn sure that they were paired

  up when they were working together.\r\n And we made darn sure that they were paired
  up when they were working together.\r\n So it was very collaborative.\r\n So like
  what kind of exercises were they doing?\r\n I mean, was there something that was
  more, well actually without leading into any kind of topic, what kind of exercises
  were you having the children do?\r\n Well, so we really wanted, we were focusing
  on the web.\r\n And we really wanted them to have a basic understanding of what
  the web was and how it worked.\r\n And so of course we were going to do some HTML
  and CSS and some light weight JavaScript, a little bit of back end stuff.\r\n But
  I also wanted them to have an appreciation for the web.\r\n But I also wanted them
  to have an appreciation for the web.\r\n But I also wanted them to have an appreciation
  for the web.\r\n But I also wanted them to have an appreciation for the web.\r\n
  But I also wanted them to have an appreciation for the web.\r\n But I also wanted
  them to have an appreciation when they clicked, you know, the return key to send
  an HTTP get request.\r\n Like what happened there?\r\n How did those packets flow
  across the net and where did they go and what came back?\r\n So we did this little
  simulation on the floor with the girls in chairs as packets.\r\n And we pushed them
  around through the network and showed how that worked.\r\n So making it real.\r\n
  Making it real.\r\n A response was assembled.\r\n We had the little, you know, HTTP
  response chopped up into pieces of paper.\r\n And then we handed them out and we
  reassembled it at the back end.\r\n And then we handed them out and we reassembled
  it at the back end.\r\n And then we handed them out and we reassembled it at the
  back end.\r\n And then we handed them out and we reassembled it at the back end.\r\n
  And then we handed them out and we reassembled it at the back end.\r\n And trying
  to get it to be a little more physical.\r\n And trying to get it to be a little
  more physical.\r\n It's an interesting thing that we're in probably the first time
  in human history where a machine is completely turned opaque.\r\n It's an interesting

  yeah.\r\n Incredible complexity is hidden behind that simple little keystroke.\r\n

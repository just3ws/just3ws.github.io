  **Mike Hall:** Hi, I’m Mike Hall. I’m standing here with Jen Lindner and Milan Dobrota. They’re working with the Tribune Company in Chicago and they’re doing a user group and support network called Tribune Tech. You’re hosting groups—you said you’ve hosted JavaScript hack nights, and you have something planned for Chicago Testing Group. Can you tell us a little bit about what you’re doing and what you’re looking to do with the community?

  **Milan Dobrota:** Sure. Tribune Technology wants to get engaged in the community and help as much as possible. We know there are a lot of great ideas out there, a lot of people, and a lot of really cool user groups. If you’re looking for hosting, or if we can help in any other way, make sure you let us know. TribuneTech is our Twitter username and we’re also on Facebook at `http://facebook.com/tribunetechnology`. We’re really trying to help the community and help ourselves because when people come to us we get engaged, we get new ideas and new technologies. That’s good for the company and good for the community—good for everybody.

  **Mike Hall:** So the groups you’ve hosted so far—are you using a lot of JavaScript and Ruby internally, and you wanted to give back to the community by hosting and bringing people in?

  **Milan Dobrota:** Yes.

  **Jen Lindner:** What happened was that the Tribune was basically saying to itself, “Nobody really knows what we do with technology. They don’t know how much we actually use.” They’ve open sourced some gems this year—there’s a lot on the Ruby side and some interesting JavaScript too. So they asked for volunteers to be an interface to the community, to support knowledge sharing and a better development culture within technology, and to let everybody know what we’re actually doing and to support the things that are good. That’s how we met and started this volunteer effort. We knew various user groups and started reaching out to people we knew in the community, saying we’d really like to host and do other things. That’s how this ball got rolling.

  **Mike Hall:** And the key metric is: are you having fun and enjoying it? This isn’t something coming from corporate—this is something you helped to create. It’s unique that a company would be saying, “How can we become more engaged with the community?” Especially one that’s not known to be a tech company.

  **Milan Dobrota:** I think that was a great idea. They came up to us and said, “We need volunteers who can give a certain number of hours to improve our culture, connect with the community, and just…” They didn’t tell us what to do, they just told us what we could do, and we didn’t have any limits. It’s really cool because everybody is a volunteer and we’re so passionate about it. We brainstormed a lot. We came up with all these ideas, including Tribune internal ideas.

  **Mike Hall:** You developed hack night shirts.

  **Milan Dobrota:** As far as external engagement goes, so far we’re doing hack nights. We did a couple of JavaScript hack nights—our Meteor.js and JavaScript events—and we’re currently talking to the Chicago Testing Group organizers. That’s a new group, so we hope to host those groups.

  **Mike Hall:** Thank you very much for taking the time to talk with me, and hopefully we’ll be able to send some people your way.

  **Jen Lindner:** Cool.

  **Milan Dobrota:** Thanks.

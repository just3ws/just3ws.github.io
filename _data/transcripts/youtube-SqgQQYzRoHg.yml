  Hi, it's Mike with U-Tastic. I'm here at GoToConf 2015. I'm
   sitting here with Dr. Rebecca Parsons, who gave a
   presentation on microservices here at the conference.
   Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
   Microservices, what was the talk about, and how did you
   come to give a presentation about microservices? What was
   the driving force for that topic?
   Well, I've had a longstanding interest in architecture, and
   I speak a lot about evolutionary architecture as a way of
   making systems that are more adaptable,
   because the system requirements that our business users are
   placing on systems, the rate of change is just continuing
   to increase.
   And so we need systems that are much more adaptable and
   evolvable than they were before.
   And microservices is a relatively new architectural style
   that is gaining traction and done well.
   Microservices architecture does allow you to make changes
   as fast as possible.
   And so this is a nice approach to architecture that achie
  ves this goal of an evolutionary architecture.
   Okay. And I know that you're coming from a much deeper
   background than somebody who's just read an article on
   microservices.
   Right.
   As a CTO at ThoughtWorks, so was this something that's
   evolved from pain that you're seeing at your clients in
   trying to figure out ways to better solve their problems?
   Not just our clients. Organizations like Netflix, Amazon,
   others are looking at architectural styles that are very
   similar to this.
   So this has really grown out of the issues that people are
   facing with services.
   Okay.
   So this has really grown out of the issues that people are
   facing with services.
   Okay.
   So this has really grown out of the issues that people are
   facing with services.
   Okay. So this has really grown out of the issues that
   people are facing with services.
   Okay. So this has really grown out of the issues that
   people are facing with services.
   that do have to be incredibly responsive, incredibly
   performant,
   and also responding to changes in required functionality.
   And so it's been our clients, but it's also been other
   people in the industry.
   Right, and it's funny to see this topic.
   It seems to me there's two camps.
   There's the DHH and this love of the monolith,
   and then there's on the other side,
   there's people who are dealing with polyglot problems.
   I know you're a polyglot programmer person,
   but polyambiguous problems that are just in all different
   types of ecosystems,
   not just a Ruby one single stack environment.
   What is it, if I'm looking and I'm trying to evaluate,
   I've got a Rails app and I'm serving this app,
   and I'm trying to figure out, hey, does this microservices
   technology,
   is this appropriate for growing my application,
   or I'm working in an environment
   that I'm trying to figure out, hey, does this microservices
   technology,
   we have a monolith, should I start thinking more about
   microservices?
   What are some of those thresholds that somebody might want
   to use
   to evaluate whether they should move towards this
   technology?
   Well, one thing is how easy or difficult you're finding it
   to make the kinds of changes that your users are expecting.
   I mean, a well-designed monolith can be the right decision.
   You would also want to consider things like
   the deployment footprint.
   If you're going to scale a monolith,
   you're going to scale the whole monolith.
   And so if you're doing horizontal scaling
   and you need four of them,
   you're going to have four of the entire monolith.
   There might only be one part of that infrastructure
   that does need to scale,
   but you don't have that choice if you're a monolith.
   So looking at the kinds of problems
   that you're running into with a monolith,
   it may be that it makes sense to stick with a monolith,
   one of the things I spend a lot of time talking about
   in the presentation were some of the issues
   and the implications.
   Microservices architectures are more complex
   than a single monolith.
   And so you want to make sure that the reason you're going
   to the microservices architecture is sound.
   Right.
   So it sounds like if I have maybe an email component
   of my application that is the one place
   that I'm always seeing performance bottleneck problems
   and I'm spinning up new instances
   just to support that aspect,
   I can maybe look at exercising that one piece
   into a microservices.
   I mean, is it an all or nothing or can I do piecemeal?
   Oh, you can definitely do piecemeal.
   Okay.
   Yeah.
   Okay, so I can just, again,
   it sounds like even just good refactoring,
   like an object.
   If I see something that's doing too much
   and I have a God object, maybe pull that out.
   I mean, is a lot of this stuff with microservices
   really just taking object-oriented programming concepts
   to a next level?
   I'm not sure I would just tie it to object orientation,
   because there's, that is one way of looking at it.
   And some of the concepts from domain-driven development,
   which people tend to associate more with object orientation
  ,
   although it doesn't have to be.
   But those concepts apply.
   And a lot of the thinking about what constitutes good
   boundaries,
   it's the same, they're the same sort of questions that are
   just being asked at a larger level.
   And when you think about it,
   any time you start with a monolith,
   you're probably not going to take a big sledgehammer
   and smack it and break it up.
   And you're going to progressively pull things out.
   And so, yes, for a time, you might have a small number
   of services working with a bigger monolith.
   And as needs arise,
   you could pull more and more stuff out of that monolith.
   - Okay, well, thank you very much
   for taking the time to speak with me.
   I appreciate it.
   - Thank you, Mike.

  User groups with lots to say, interviews and more, no way,
   sharing great ideas in
   the tech community. Fascinating conversations, a plethora
   of information
   find out for yourself today at ugtastic.com. Hi it's Mike
   again with UGtastic.
   Today I'm sitting down with Anna Lear who is a community
   manager with Stack
   Exchange. Stack Exchange is a pretty large site and if you
  're a developer
   you've probably have spent a good deal of time either
   asking questions or
   getting answers from the site. Thanks a lot for sitting
   down with me
   Anna, I really appreciate it. It's good to be here. Thanks,
   can you tell me a little bit
   about what is Stack Exchange overall and what is a
   community manager and how did
   you get involved in that? Sure, well Stack Exchange is by
   now a network of a hundred
   question-and-answer websites. We started out with Stack
   Overflow
   which is a site for programmers of all kinds and pretty
   much any language and
   our basic goal is to provide a place or several places
   where people can come
   with their questions and they can get expert answers on
   whatever topic that
   they happen to be interested in. So as a community manager
   I'm part of a team
   there's about six of us. What we do is we try to work with
   different sites and
   different communities and try to teach them about what
   makes a good Q&A website,
   what kind of things make up sites that are truly helpful.
   So what we usually do
   is we spend a lot of time, well okay let me back up for a
   second, each site
   including Stack Overflow has a corresponding meta site that
   allows its
   community to kind of gather and talk amongst themselves and
   determine how the
   site is going to run and handle different issues that come
   up. So as
   community managers we spend a lot of time monitoring those
   meta sites and
   jumping in to help out with answers and kind of sharing our
   expertise and
   lessons learned over the past several years. What are some
   of these meta sites? What is a meta site?
   It is literally pretty much exactly the same as any main
   site. So
   let's say Stack Overflow on the main site on Stack Overflow
   you will have
   questions about programming you know C#, Java, whatever. On
   the meta site the only
   thing that's on topic is Stack Overflow the site. So people
   would come in with
   questions about why a certain question was closed for
   example or what
   kind of things are on topic. They might want a
   clarification or they might want
   to say well we have a couple different tags that need to be
   merged. Can somebody
   help us out? And that happens basically with every
   community. We provide a way
   for the community to self-govern like that. So it's a way
   to say oh you
   posted this WordPress configuration. Stack Overflow isn't
   the right place to
   do that. Check out wordpress. is it wordpress.stackexchange
   yeah so I mean basically you help redirect people to the
   right place
   potentially yeah if somebody came to Stack Overflow and
   they posted a
   WordPress configuration question and it got well now it's
   put on hold we
   recently rolled out some changes to make closing a little
   nicer but they might
   come to meta and they can they can ask why that happened
   and somebody would say
   hey we have this other site you know your question would be
   more welcome
   there okay
   so you're you're dealing with a lot of developers who are
   maybe dealing with an
   issue and they're trying to get information do you ever
   have to defuse
   any kind of situations or get really angry over a question
   being closed?
   It certainly happens for sure. Our site moderators actually
   take care of a lot of those
   disputes. That's what moderators are there for is to kind
   of keep things
   running smoothly.
   They're all volunteers and they're doing a fantastic job.
   But once in a while we
   as community managers also step in. I don't know that it
   happens a lot but
   there's definitely situations when somebody gets really
   upset and we have
   to be very careful about explaining to them how the site
   works without
   invalidating what they're feeling and invalidating what
   their experience is.
   And so you work with a team of six people? Yeah, that's a
   good question. We have a lot of volunteers and they're all
   volunteers and they're doing a fantastic job. But once in a
   while we as community managers also step in. I don't know
   that it happens a lot but there's definitely situations
   when somebody gets really upset and we have to be very
   careful about explaining to them how the site works without
   invalidating what their feeling and invalidating what their
   experience is.
   And so you you work with a team of six people and you
   mostly interact through
   Meta or do you work with the moderators?
   Um, yes to both. So we make heavy use of chat rooms. So
   Stack Overflow and Stack
   Exchange has a chat system as well. So we have internal
   chat rooms that we use
   within the team and across the teams at Stack Exchange and
   we also have
   moderator-only chat rooms where we talk to moderators and
   kind of provide more
   real-time interaction. So and as far as as the kind of
   information you're
   probably seeing, I'm just curious, has there ever been, as
   you're going in and
   moderating things, I mean I'm sure there's some of the
   questions where you're
   like, "Why are people asking this? Don't they read the FAQ
  ?"
   But, as you're going in and moderating things, I'm sure
   there's some of the questions where you're like, "Why are
   people asking this? Don't they read the FAQ?"

   oh no that was one oh um
   yeah this is not going to be helpful something on stack
   overflow that
   ended up talking about railroads oh really i think
   yeah well now yeah now watch somebody try and find it and
   it's going to be something
   completely different but uh yeah no nothing that's off the
   top of my head that i can like
   point to right now just maybe is there so much information
   that you have to troll through
   to to to manage that it's not much that you can actually
   read
   uh pretty much yeah i mean i don't spend a lot of my time
   um anymore unfortunately uh
   like actually browsing stack overflow and reading questions
   for kind of personal
   um enjoyment uh most of the things i end up seeing right
   now are actually
   problematic in some way uh somebody emailed us
   to get
   support or i'm responding to a flag um for moderator
   attention or something like that
   so i end up seeing a lot of kind of average type stuff once
   in a while though i mean i still i
   still watch like hacker news and all that kind of stuff so
   great questions still happen and uh
   they get promoted in those ways yeah and um
   as far as dealing with people that are uh looking at trying
   to get their you know
   again with the questions trying to be answered uh
   are there any myths that you've run into where people
   make assumptions like i know on reddit people often get
   angry at the mods and
   there's occasionally moderator revolts where they try to
   take down a moderator who people disagree with uh how they
  're how they're
   uh how a moderator decided a certain set of questions
   should or posts should be
   handled or changed rules uh is there any uh has there been
   anything like that that you've been
   struck at with stack exchange where you've you've had
   people directly come in conflict with a
   moderator or question oh definitely definitely uh there's
   many many examples on metastack overflow
   of that um one that uh kind of sticks in mind uh is um not
   the last moderator election but the one
   before it i think uh we elected four moderators um and uh
   one of them i think at the time he was 19
   and uh somebody and i think he closed the question i don't
   exactly remember the specifics anymore
   but somebody came to meta and basically wrote this giant
   rant about how teenage moderators are
   ruining stack overflow and it is the worst thing that has
   ever happened so it was basically like
   he picked specifically on that moderator and um things just
   went downhill from there it was
   interesting you mentioned moderator moderator elections how
   does that work uh so about once a
   year uh
   give or take uh we run moderator elections so what happens
   is all of our moderators are volunteers
   uh and um when the site when a site is still in public beta
   um i should probably explain that too
   so when somebody before we create a new site in the network
   um we work uh from a list of site
   proposals uh that are brought to us by anybody on the
   internet uh we have a special site for that
   area 51 uh we have a special site for that area 51 uh we
   have a special site for that area 51
   um and once a proposal uh gathers a certain uh number of
   followers and people who kind of commit
   to making that site a reality uh that site goes into a
   private beta for about a week to kind of
   hash out the immediate issues and whatnot and then it goes
   into a public beta and during that time
   it's open to anybody anybody can participate and for that
   period we appoint moderators based on a
   few criteria people who were active early in the site who
   kind of showed aptitude uh for community
   moderation but once the site graduates from public beta uh
   we hold moderator elections uh so this
   gives the opportunity uh for any community members uh who
   are interested to nominate themselves uh and
   kind of you know basically they they come back come forth
   with their platform and kind of explain
   how they want to make the site better what you know what
   attracts them uh to being a moderator
   what they like about the site and uh then people vote for
   them and uh you know
   um and then people vote for them and uh you know and then
   people vote for them and uh you know
   uh so we have an entire system built for that it's
   basically um open stv um i don't know that
   so it's um oh man the way it works is uh somewhat
   complicated and i can never quite remember that
   there's a meta post on how exactly the votes are counted
   but it's basically people pick their top
   three um picks and then um the first there's a count of
   like first votes um that a person
   gets and then once they hit a threshold they're elected and
   then like other votes that are cast
   for them trickle down to other people and yeah possibly not
   too familiar with that it's it's it's
   i'm not gonna be able to explain it well but it's basically
   sounds like you have three candidates
   and then you vote there's a way to hash out which one
   actually got the most votes of the three
   candidates uh i'll link to it in the show notes and then i
  'll link to it in the show notes and then
   i'll link to it in the show notes because i'm not from aust
  ralia i just know that it's been
   explained to me by an australian uh that's how it worked um
   so um okay so you know just uh to
   speak personally about you how did you get involved with
   stack exchange uh so i mean you
   talked about how moderators get elected but how how did the
   community manager position
   evolve and and how did you end up becoming one well how it
   evolved
   is slightly before my time um from what i know uh robert
   cartano uh he's our director of community
   development uh he was the first community manager that
   stack exchange uh ever had and um all i know
   about that is that at some point he was approached by jeff
   atwood and they worked something out
   which is basically how pretty much everything i believe got
   uh done in those days um
   but uh eventually you know the team grew uh by the time i
   got to it uh i'm a software developer by trade uh so i
   joined stack overflow um didn't really spend
   a lot of time on it uh but when programmers stack exchange
   launched uh i kind of really got into
   that and um it was um it was it was somewhat controversial
   uh at the time it uh it was
   proposed as a place where everything that's off topic on
   stack overflow
   can live and that really didn't work uh it just really
   created a terrible site
   uh and eventually
   it evolved you know and it and now it became kind of you
   know the the whiteboard side of stack
   overflow where you can kind of hash out you know software
   practices and design all that kind of
   stuff but anyway um i was elected a moderator on
   programmers so i nominated in the first election
   and ran um and from there i just discovered kind of the
   rest of the network um and i spent more
   and more time on metas uh and uh i eventually went back to
   stack overflow and became a moderator on
   stack overflow
   and from there i got the job
   is everybody on the community manager team coming through a
   similar path or
   um not necessarily uh unfortunately she's no longer with us
   but we had um um a community
   manager earthy uh who did not have a developer background
   uh she uh got on the team through an
   internal um arrangement uh i think right now everybody on
   the team has some sort of development
   past okay so at the moment i'm not sure if i'm going to be
   able to do that but i'm going to
   everybody has a little bit of uh skin in the game so to
   speak of yeah understanding what what is
   being talked about and a concept of what is what is the the
   um spirit of the of the conversation on
   on stack exchange because it's people who are marketing
   experts it's people who are developers
   who are passionate about these topics and are good at
   working with a lot of people well on stack
   overflow for sure
   um i mean we have we have a lot of sites uh on topics that
   aren't really developer oriented
   uh we have a site about cooking photography uh video games
   you know all that kind of stuff
   uh there's definitely sites where none of us have any
   experience with whatsoever uh but a lot but
   most of the lessons that we've learned from stack overflow
   and from other sites they really just
   translate across the board so okay well thank you very much
   for taking the time to sit down
   with me i really appreciate it thank you
   you

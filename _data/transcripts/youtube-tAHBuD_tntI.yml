  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2014 and I
  'm sitting here with
   Tim Bray who's the co-inventor of XML and he's a keynote
   speaker here today at
   the GOTO Conf. Thank you very much for taking the time to
   speak with me today,
   Tim. Can you tell us a little bit about your talk and what
   you're hoping people
   take home from it? Well I've been mixed up in my, you know,
   my most most recent
   job was at Google and I spent a couple of years in the
   Android groups there and
   then subsequently did work in other areas and I've become
   keenly aware of
   sort of the tension in the marketplace between people who
   are sort of browser
   and web technology centric and people who are mobile cent
  ric and I think
   there's are some really good reasons to worry that the
   notion of the browser is
   losing its centrality in the world of app development.
   And so what I'm going to talk about today is, is that
   really a problem? Is that
   actually happening? And if so, why? And assuming it is
   happening, is that a
   problem that we should worry about? And if it's a problem
   we should worry about
   then is there anything we could do to improve it? Now this
   is unscheduled but
   I'm also going to take a side trip into privacy. Okay.
   Because I've been doing a
   lot of work on that recently and in the era of Ed Snowden,
   you know, we should all
   be worried about that. Yes. You may think you don't have a
   privacy problem in your work, but you probably do.
   Yeah. Well, I mean, even with services that are very
   popular like HipChat recently, I don't know if you're
   familiar with, they had a change in their privacy policy
   when our one-on-one
   chats are able to be exposed to your employer. I mean, even
   things like, like
   that. And when you talk, but to go back to your original
   keynote, when you're
   talking about browser versus non-browser, are you talking
   about native apps versus...
   Yeah, I'm talking about native apps. Okay. You know,
   increasingly if
   somebody's going to build an app, they're actually going to
   build three apps.
   They're going to build, you know, a browser version, an iOS
   version, an Android
   version, and that's already a problem because, you know,
   you're having to
   replicate your work multiple times to get a result. And who
   knows, you know,
   Windows Mobile could get a good foothold and we'd all be
   doing our work four
   times in a row. So right there there's a problem. And then
   even different form factors. Well, you know,
   that just comes with the game. That's actually, you know,
   not the big biggest part of the problem. And
   whereas, you know, there's a lot of advantages to mobile
   apps and people are moving in that
   direction for reasons, some of which are good, you know,
   there's some downsides to that too.
   And we need to, you know, make sure we understand what the
   upsides and downsides are of having a
   browser-centric worldview as opposed to a native mobile app
  -centric worldview and make the right
   choices in an intelligent way. And just, you know, to inter
  weave that
   into the privacy, is it a good thing that we're moving
   towards native apps versus
   browsers as far as, maybe, privacy is concerned? So the
   reason I ask is, I mean, I know cookies and
   spying, you know, cross-browser checking of cookies and
   tracking, that's one thing you can do in a
   browser but maybe you wouldn't be able to do like that in a
   native app. Yeah, I suppose, but I think that's a small
   issue compared to the big issues. And the big issues are,
   you know, the actual
   criminals and bad guys who are trying to subvert your
   account and steal your information
   and your money. And on the other hand, the over-enthusi
  astic employees of
   our governments who feel that, you know, everybody would
   just be safer if they
   knew everything about everybody and why would anybody want
   privacy unless they
   were doing something wrong? I think, you know, they have
   much bigger tools than
   cookies. They have, you know, court orders and national
   security letters for us to
   worry about. Well, I mean, there was actually a tweet I saw
   this morning
   about the amount of data that the NSA has collected was in
   the order of exabytes,
   but it would take 350 years to sort it. That, like, is
   there
   a point where they just have so much information and it
   becomes... Well, Google's
   got way more than that. Oh, okay. And Google, you know, can
   give you sub-second results on
   searching the whole thing. So, you know, that doesn't
   really sound like a...I wouldn't
   buy that argument. I think that if they employ smart people
   who know
   how to index things and so on, which they do, they would be
   able to make good use
   of that stuff. So, I mean, that kind of describes it. There
   is a precedent for having
   extremely large...I mean, we use it every day.
   It's become a household term. You know, grandmothers who've
   never used a computer,
   they know to Google for something. Right. And they can sift
   through data like
   nobody's business. That's right. Why wouldn't the NSA be
   able to do that? Exactly. What have you
   found in particular that maybe isn't something that people
   are really talking
   about yet? I mean, Snowden's obviously a very popular topic
  , but... Well, I think we
   need to buckle down and think about it. I think that, to
   start with, you know, the
   room I'm talking to today is going to be full of people who
   build apps. And a
   question I would have for them is, "Are you really
   confident that your app will
   work if I address it with HTTPS URLs as opposed to HTTP
   URLs?" Even better, you
   know, does your work...does your app automatically work
   with HTTPS only?
   Right. Because if you do that, then you've removed, you
   know, one huge window of
   vulnerability, ranging...which is open to anybody from the
   NSA to some guy
   running fire sheep in a coffee shop. Right. And I think it
  's, you know, it's
   incumbent upon the app builders to take a big piece of the
   responsibility for
   preserving the privacy of the people who use it. And that
   means they not only need
   to do the obvious things like use HTTPS, they need to think
   very carefully about,
   you know, what information they gather about people, what
   they store about people,
   what they tell people, what their policy is as regards
   legal demands that they receive.
   And they need to be clear about that stuff. And because laz
  iness produces a really bad
   result. Yeah. Well, you know, having been guilty of that
   myself, as far as looking at
   the expedient problem, like, over the last few years, or
   several years ago, XML was
   the de facto way to exchange information. But over the last
   couple years, JSON has
   kind of become more popular. And there's...I've heard pros
   and cons about
   adopting a very strict semantic language like XML that can
  ...excuse me,
   a more easily correct description of a language through XML
   versus kind of a loosey-goosey
   JSON. Is that something maybe that's indicative of the way
   we're approaching writing applications
   at this point? Where we're just like, what is the least
   amount of effort I need to do
   to push data over the wire? Should we be stepping back and
   really thinking more about how we're
   pushing stuff over the wire? Well, you may be right, but
   that's okay. I mean, there's
   so much work to do that we should all be trying to do the
   simplest thing that could possibly work.
   You know, do things in the simplest way that could work.
   Then you worry about your constraints.
   And as regards XML versus JSON, I mean, JSON is clearly,
   clearly superior if you're exchanging
   database records and file updates and that kind of stuff.
   If you're exchanging blog posts
   or credit reports or medical health records, XML wins for
   that. So they have different
   areas of strength. But I would worry not so much about the
   form of the content, whether it's XML or JSON. I'd worry
   about, is it traveling safely across the network in a way
   that somebody who's using my app can
   be really, really sure that they're connecting to me, not
   to somebody else, and that nobody
   else can watch the stuff going along? And then having
   established that, sort of the bare
   minimum barrier to entry, then you have to answer questions
   like, okay, if I use your
   app, what information are you gathering about me? How are
   you protecting it? Under what
   conditions will you release it and to whom? And, you know,
   you could write, there's a real big takeaway
   in letters of fire 50 feet high, and they say, don't
   surprise me. You know, if you, people are, end up getting
   a nasty surprise about what you're doing with their data,
   the results will be really bad for you, and you
   won't say you really want to avoid that.
   All right. Well, thank you very much for taking the time to
   speak with me. I appreciate it.

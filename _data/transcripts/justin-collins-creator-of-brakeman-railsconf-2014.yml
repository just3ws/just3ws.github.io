  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here again at RailsConf
   2014 and I'm standing here with Justin Collins.
   Justin is going to be doing a talk tomorrow called "Tales
   from the Crypt" but he's also the creator of the Brakeman
   Gem.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
   me.
   First, can we start with the Brakeman Gem? Because I'm a
   fan, but I'd like you to describe what it is.
   Sure. So, the Brakeman Gem is a static analysis security
   tool for Ruby on Rails applications.
   So, it looks at your source code, finds potential
   vulnerabilities, and lets you know about them.
   Great. But wait, it's a dynamic language. How can we do any
   kind of static analysis?
   Oh, boy. So, I've talked about that quite a bit.
   You know, the important thing for a security tool is just
   finding stuff.
   And, yes, static analysis security purists may be upset
   because you can't prove certain things or you can't analyze
   certain things.
   But for a security tool, it's really not that important
   that it be perfect, but just that we're able to identify
   potential problems inside the source code.
   So, it's kind of like if you, just because you can't maybe
   identify everything, it doesn't mean that it's going to
   work.
   Yeah.
   So, it's kind of like if you, just because you can't maybe
   identify everything, it doesn't mean that it's going to
   work.
   Yeah.
   So, it's kind of like if you, just because you can't maybe
   identify everything, it doesn't mean that it's going to
   work.
   Yeah.
   So, it's kind of like if you, just because you can't maybe
   identify everything, it doesn't mean that it's going to
   work.
   mean you shouldn't identify exactly exactly so so what kind
   of inspired you to create sov right
   then um it's kind of a long story but uh basically i got an
   internship on a security team at att
   interactive and i had proposed during my interview
   something like this knowing nothing about security
   or rails or i mean i knew what it was but no experience
   with rails i proposed hey what if
   you just had a tool that found this stuff for you right and
   then they said hey why don't you work
   on a tool that would find this stuff for us um and they
   were nice enough to allow me to open source
   it at the end of my internship and then i worked for them
   later uh as well on it so so security is
   something that you're have a passion about um i mean i fell
   into it by accident you know like
   i just happened to get an internship on a security team no
   real uh security experience before that
   but um i you know i've been able to create a tool that's
   been really helpful for people and through
   that tool i've gotten into the security community and you
   know i i think as a developer there's
   always an advantage to being a developer and having
   security knowledge because a lot of times
   the security community is not perceived as being very nice
   people or very smart people sometimes
   by developers who are like i'm just trying to get stuff
   done they're always blaming me for doing
   things wrong but what they know they don't even write code
   right right so it's always good to be
   able to bridge that gap and approach people you know in a
   nice way be a nice person right yeah and
   and you know i've liked being able to run the the brickman
   analysis on my gem and and a few other
   you know on my projects a few other uh gems you know along
   those lines of the rails uh best
   practices sure and um and then bullet you know anything
   that can help give a little bit of
   insight into what's going on in the code is always great
   but i was curious you said you
   can't cover everything is there something maybe you could
   think of
   that you would like to be able to cover but as a common
   problem it's just kind of too hard to
   really pin down that developers on rails projects should be
   thinking about um wow that's a really
   good question um yes i mean there are there are things that
   are difficult to determine statically
   there are some things that it would just take too much time
   to determine and i try to keep
   up to date with the things that i've done and i think that
  's the best way to do it um so i think
   that's the best way to do it for most people um i think one
   like one good example for example is
   that uh you know you don't always know what gems are doing
   the breakdown doesn't look at your
   dependencies um helper methods for example they tend to use
   html safe a lot because maybe they're
   building out tags and you tend to trust those helper
   methods because somebody wrote it and they
   probably know what they were doing and in your view it
   looks like it's escaped but actually the
   helper might be setting html safe and building out some
   tags but they're also putting in user
   input now you have cross-site scripting okay and that's
   something that brakeman could possibly find
   but uh right now it can't so so something to look at is
   look at your gems if they're doing dynamic
   if you're content generally yeah any kind of content
   generation any kind of oh i'm using this
   helper to generate some html you might want to look into
   that and see what exactly are they doing are
   they properly escaping the values or are they just calling
   html safe and and just jamming it in
   there yeah exactly exactly so it brings me over to your
   talk the uh it's it's a group talk but
   it's tales from the crypt yes and i now i'm presuming that
  's encryption uh that would be a
   good assumption yeah but we're actually not going to talk
   about encryption at all okay yes uh well
   it's a very side note okay um to be honest i didn't notice
   the pun until after the talk was
   done oh we should have done something uh with this pun yeah
   i have some probably because with
   with open ss all heart bleed stuff encryption is kind of a
   hot topic right now it is a hot topic
   but i think everyone's kind of aware you know i have very
   non-technical people approach me and say
   hey what about heart bleed like did that affect twitter you
   know did should i do something and
   these are people who are not technical at all and yet they
  've heard about it so i don't think
   probably people at rails
   comp don't need to hear about it even more right right um
   and that wasn't the the purpose of our
   talk the purpose of our talk is just um we really we're
   going to present sort of your your worst
   nightmare one day in the life of a couple developers at a
   company and it's just like
   one security problem after another okay and just kind of
   trying to demonstrate you know and these
   things happen i mean people find these problems uh people's
   sites get hacked into and so we're just
   it's kind of just a teaching and hopefully we can present
   some proactive steps to prevent these
   really bad days from happening well i'm looking forward to
   your talk and i really appreciate you
   taking the time to speak with me now no problem thank you
   thank you great perfect thank you very
   much yeah man my legs are funny um you know that was uh
   have some pure static analysis
   uh or at least information no so the story i was going to
   tell you
   uh all right so i i worked with uh not directly worked with
   aaron but we sat in proximity to each
   other uh hey group on okay the the first group time the
   first time yes and um user groups with
   lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas
   in the tech community fascinating

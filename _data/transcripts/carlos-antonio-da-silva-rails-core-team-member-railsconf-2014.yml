  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at RailsConf 2014,
   and I'm standing here with
   Carlos Antonio da Silva, who's a software developer with
   Platformatech, and you might
   also know some of his projects, Devise, Simpleform. He's
   also a Rails core contributor. He gave a talk
   today about some of the tricks that Rails didn't teach you.
   Did I say that correctly?
   Yeah, tricks that Rails didn't tell you about.
   Tricks that Rails didn't tell you about. So thank you very
   much for taking the time to speak with
   me. I appreciate it. So can you tell me a little bit more
   about tricks that Rails didn't tell me
   about?
   Right, yeah. So the idea behind this talk is that I've been
   working with Rails for around six years,
   and I've been in a lot of different projects and seen a lot
   of different code from different people
   around the world.
   And people get used to writing their own code without
   actually looking at what Rails can give
   them. So there are times where we see code that could be
   replaced by Rails' existing features,
   features that were released in newer versions, or even
   features that were since the beginning in
   Rails, right? And the idea was just to show some nice
   tricks that Rails has, some small features,
   features that people don't use that much, and that can help
   them on a database while working with
   Rails. And that can make their code better. And that can
   make their code better.
   And that can make their code better, simpler, and easier to
   understand. So that's the whole idea
   behind the talk. What was an example of one that was a real
   common kind of thing that you maybe,
   when you're seeing contributions back to Rails, is that a
   place where you often see those, where
   people are contributing back redundant code, or is this
   talking about applications that people are
   writing with Rails, and they just keep reinventing the
   wheel?
   Yeah, it's usually applications that people are writing
   that try to reinvent the wheel, because
   they write features that Rails already gives them, right?
   They try to do things that are
   over-complex, and that Rails can simplify by using some of
   the Rails features. So that was the idea of
   showing some of these tricks. Maybe I will post more on a
   blog post or something, but the idea
   behind that was that people should first, before actually
   going, writing down the code, go search,
   ask around, and see if Rails can help them in some way to
   make their code simpler.
   Okay. And we were talking a little bit before the interview
   about your contributions
   to open source, and I asked about Platformatech, and you
   said that it was kind of a funny story
   that you had come to Platformatech through open source.
   Yeah, yeah. So it's been almost five years that I'm working
   there. I was actually
   the first external guy to start working at Platformatech,
   besides the four founders.
   And I started because of open source, because I was working
   as a freelancer,
   back like five years ago, and I was using one of Jose Bolin
  's projects, which is called
   Inherited Resources, and I was talking to him in the
   mailing list and asking a bunch of stuff,
   helping him with some issues and all that stuff, and he
   sent me an email asking if I would like to
   work with them in a project. Like, it was just a project at
   the beginning, because they were
   needing someone, and somehow, I don't know how, they
   thought about me, because I was talking to him, and
   well, then I did that project, I started that project with
   them, because of the open source discussions we were having
  ,
   and after that, we started working together.
   Yeah. So was that before you started working with the Rails
   team, or...?
   Yeah, yeah, that was before. After that, I started
   contributing to Rails, and then more and more since then.
   So how did you go about becoming involved and contributing
   to Rails core? How did that come about?
   Yeah, so after starting working at Platformatech, I started
   working with Rails, and then after that, I started working
   with Rails, and then more and more since then.
   So how did you go about becoming involved and contributing
   to Rails, and then after that, I started working with Rails
  , and then more and more since then.
   Well, we got involved more in Rails, because JosÃ© was also
   part of the Rails... Actually, he got part of the Rails
   core team in 2010, I guess, but we were always discussing,
   and every time we found a bug, we tried to send a pre-re
  quest to fix that.
   Platformatech has this culture of encouraging people to
   contribute more, right? So at that time, we started doing
   some minor bug fixes and trying to keep up to date with
   what was going on in Rails, also, and that
   was opening doors for us to contribute more and more. Maybe
   fixing some documentation, maybe fixing some issue, or ref
  actoring a code that just got merged is also a good way.
   So I started contributing more and more and more like that,
   and then there was a time where I had, like, 1,000 commits
   or something.
   Yeah, that's a lot of commits to open source. So you've
   been quite prolific. But that's 1,000 commits into Rails,
   you mean?
   Into Rails, yeah.
   That's not even counting all the other projects.
   No, no, no.
   Okay. So what was the process to become a core team member?
   How did that work? Did they have the ceremony? Did they
   light the torch?
   No.
   Can you talk about it?
   Yes, yes, sure. Well, as I said, I was contributing more
   and more, and as I was contributing more, I was actually
   needing more feedback from the guys that were core or
   already core.
   They were contributors, right? So there was a time where
   they added me to a campfire room where some contributors
   hang around there to talk about Rails, talk about the
   issues and things like that.
   So that was, like, the first step, getting to talk more
   about with the contributors, guys. And then we started
   contributing more and more to Rails because of that,
   because we have, like, direct contact with them.
   So we ended up contributing more.
   And, well, after that, after some time...
   After some time, they got us access to the issues tracker,
   so we could close issues.
   We actually had, at that time, access to commit to Rails,
   but we were not allowed to because, like, GitHub does not
   allow to block only commits and give access to issues.
   So we were giving access to issues, but we were just not
   committers.
   Right, right. So that was more of just trust.
   Yeah, more of a way of trusting us that we would...
   Like, help them with issues and pull requests and, ah, this
   pull request is about to merge, then ping someone that can
   merge it, basically, something like that.
   And, well, after some time working on issues and helping
   them with pull requests and reviewing code and all that
   stuff, they gave us access to commit.
   Commit access to Rails, so we were, like, contributors. We
   could merge pull requests, send our own commits and things
   like that.
   And, well, after, like, more than a year or so contributing
   like that, more or less.
   And, well, after some time, we were, like, more or less
   contributing like that.
   And, well, after some time, we were, like, more or less
   contributing like that.

  Hi, it's Mike with UBITASIC. I'm here at GoToConf 2015 and
   I'm sitting here with
   Trisha G who gave a talk about leveling up your automated
   tests. Thank you very
   much for taking the time to speak with me. So, leveling up
   your automated tests,
   what is, can you tell us more about that? Sure, so I, it's
   a long story I guess, but it was
   about when I had been working at a financial exchange where
   we were really
   anal about testing. We had like tests at every single level
  , we did test driven
   development, did our tests first, and I kind of got so used
   to working that way
   and I worked that way for about four years, that I assumed
   that all developers
   had evolved to work that way as well. And then I moved to a
   different project
   where we did automated testing, which is a massive step up
   from other places I've
   been in the past, but the automated testing was not as
   comprehensive as I would have liked to have seen. So, the
   talk is really about the
   story of trying to go from writing tests to tick the box of
  , yeah I wrote a test,
   to writing tests that have value, writing tests that do
   something useful,
   but not in a kind of, you must write tests kind of way, in
   a kind of way where
   as developers we go, all right this is kind of fulfilling
   if you like, or
   satisfying, or fun, or or whatever. So how do we get our
   mind into a place where
   tests is not like, oh god I have to write a test, but like,
   oh cool I get to, I get
   to experiment now, and this is where I start writing my
   experimental tests
   around the code that I've written. And it's interesting
   because I just interviewed Jay
   Fields a few minutes ago, and he talked about unselfish
   tests, and he talked
   about motivation, you know, what is your motivation for
   writing the test, and it
   sounds like that is something along the lines of what you
  're trying to figure
   out, is actually like, how do you go about evaluating what
   your motivation is?
   Right, exactly. So the talk is really around, I mean it's a
   specific journey
   that we took, and a technical solution that worked for us,
   but the talk, the
   lesson really should be the journey that we took in terms
   of looking at what
   tests can do, what you think they do, what they can give
   you, why we weren't
   doing the best job we could have done with the tests, and
   how we tackled each
   of those problems. And one of the main things is to realize
   that writing tests
   is not to check that the code that you wrote works, writing
   tests is for things
   like checking, it was to give you maintainability, read
  ability,
   documentation. Yeah, does it do what I expect it to do?
   Right, does it do, yeah, does it, does it document?
   Does it, does it document what the system should do, and
   you know, does it, does it
   handle these edge cases I didn't really think of, and that
   sort of thing? Right, and you
   know, the last time we spoke you were with a different
   company, but now you're
   with JetBrains, and, and they deal with such a wide variety
   of tools, they provide
   tools for, you know, Object C, through Java, through .NET,
   I mean, is that, is that
   reflected in some of the lessons you've learned with, you
   know, how you approach
   testing? Did that?
   I mean, well, so this particular talk was based on my
   experiences at Mongo, but the
   thing was that it was quite good, so we were heavy users of
   IntelliJ IDEA, and
   when we were using Spock with Groovy, which is a language
   which was not
   familiar to us, IntelliJ IDEA really helped us with that
   stuff, because it kind of
   helped us, helped guide us towards better Groovy practices,
   and helped us to write
   tests which were, which looked right and felt right, and so
   I guess, I haven't been
   at JetBrains long enough to know the impact enough of that
   company on the testing stuff,
   but I have to say that using the JetBrains tools at Mongo
   really helped us write better,
   faster tests, and it gave us the feedback we wanted from
   the tests.
   Yeah, and going from using a tool to working at a company,
   I can't think of a better
   testimony for, for how good the tools are.
   Right.
   It's like, oh, I, I used this tool, it was so good, I want
   to work there.
   Right, exactly, and the, the great thing about working for
   JetBrains and the fact
   they make IntelliJ.
   So, I'm kind of looking at the IntelliJ stuff.
   Yeah.
   The IntelliJ tool set, plus also a bit of TeamCity and Ups
  ource, and a lot of these
   kind of enterprise-type tools that generally Java
   developers will be using in the real
   world, but all the stuff that I've kind of learned as a
   Java developer is applicable
   in this role.
   Right.
   Because, you know, I've been using this tool for a long
   time.
   I know that it's great for this, and I know shortcuts are
   good for this, and I know there's
   a lot of stuff that I didn't know, and when I discovered it
  , I was like, oh, that's
   amazing, it makes my life better.
   Yeah.
   So, my job now is to take all the stuff where I thought,
   wow, that's amazing, and I'm
   going to put it on videos or on small animated GIFs and
   show it to everyone and say, look
   what you can do.
   Yeah.
   So, it's, you're getting to do a little bit more teaching.
   Yes.
   And sharing out.
   Yeah.
   So, I just drew a blank.
   It's the end of the day at the end of the conference, so,
   but the role that you're
   doing now is, you know, I want to just kind of dovetail
   into being a developer advocate
   and going on some conversations.
   Some conversations I've heard that had happened on Twitter
   that maybe described that the role
   of developer evangelist and advocate isn't quite as well
   understood by the community
   as it is.
   Can I ask you some questions about being a developer
   advocate?
   Sure.
   What is it, what is that role?
   What does that job mean?
   Okay.
   So, I will answer it from my point of view.
   Okay, yeah.
   And one of the interesting things about developer advocate,
   developer evangelist is that it
   depends from job to job and from company to company, so, at
   MongoDB, what was very important
   to us was as evangelists, we were proper developers.
   We worked full-time normally on a code base that was used,
   for example, in my case, it
   was the MongoDB Java driver, and we would go out and talk
   about MongoDB the server and
   the Java driver.
   And that's great, but you end up getting torn in two
   directions because you sort of have
   this full-time coding job, which is necessary because you
   need to have the, what's the word?
   Practical.
   Yeah.
   I'm thinking in Spanish now.
   I don't even know Spanish.
   You need to be--
   Practical?
   No.
   You need to be reputable and developers need to believe
   that you understand about development.
   But to be doing development, proper full-time development
   and traveling and creating content
   and writing blog posts and stuff is a lot of work.
   Right.
   So, at JetBrains, my role is much more around the, like you
   say, the educational
   side of stuff.
   So, I'm still doing coding.
   I'm still contributing, actually, to Morphea and to MongoDB
  .
   Because they're open-source projects.
   Okay.
   I'm still writing my own projects.
   So, here I get to write projects which demonstrate
   something in particular.
   So, I've got a project which demonstrates Java 8, Lambdas,
   and Streams with, like, tiny,
   tiny services that you might call micro-sized.
   I've heard that term floating around in this conference.
   So, I've been writing some codes that demonstrate
   particular things.
   So, I really like, well, I wanted to see how Java 8 works
   in real life.
   Right.
   So, I needed a real Java 8 project, which I created.
   And I wanted to see how IntelliVentures works.
   And I wanted to see how Java 8 works in real life.
   Right.
   So, I needed a real Java 8 project, which I created.
   Right.
   And I wanted to see how IntelliVentures works in real life.
   Right.
   And I wanted to see how IntelliJ helps you write Java 8
   code.
   Okay.
   So, I created that code for that.
   So, it kind of lets you drill into a certain sector of a
   topic.
   Right.
   And I can continue to maintain this, but I don't need to
   because no one else is using
   it.
   It's kind of fulfilled a goal.
   And I can now write a bunch of stuff around this.
   So, I have a talk around it, but I also can write some blog
   posts or I've also used it
   to create some screencasts to say, "Look, if you want to do
   some shortcuts in IntelliJ
   around creating Lambdas, you can do this."
   Mm-hmm.
   It's a real code that works to demonstrate that.
   So, a little bit of research and experimentation that might
   not have been in a job where you're
   like, "Oh, I got a deadline and I have to deliver this
   feature."
   Right.
   So, "Oh, and I also have to write a blog post."
   Right.
   Exactly.
   It's more like, "What can I write a blog post about?"
   Yes.
   Yeah.
   Yeah.
   So, that's interesting how it kind of flips that on the
   head.
   Is that a common thing for developer advocates across...
  because you said you put the caveat.
   You're describing your situation.
   Right.
   Right.
   How does that maybe different...
   I think some of the companies put...
   Some of the companies put more focus on content.
   I mean, content takes quite a long time to come up with.
   If I'm going to write a blog post about Java 8 features,
   for example, that could take...
   I mean, it could take weeks, you know?
   Right.
   To put together a good blog post.
   So, some companies focus more on that sort of content.
   Some companies, like I say, a bit more like Mongo, you tend
   to have a proper engineering
   role where you also have to deliver something engineering-
  wise.
   And for some companies, the developer advocate role is a
   role within marketing, and for some
   companies, it's a role within engineering.
   For JetBrains, it is its own organization, which we talk to
   the product owners for each
   of the individual products, because we have to...and even
   developers for the products.
   So we have very close ties to the engineering team, but we
  're also outside of marketing,
   so we talk to the marketing guys, too.
   And that's nice.
   That allows us to balance...because marketing and
   engineering are two...have two differing
   goals, if you like.
   Yeah.
   Yeah, slightly.
   One is to, like, deliver the product, and the other is to
   tell a story around the product.
   Yeah.
   And...but the engineering will get the product done when it
  's ready.
   Yeah.
   Yeah.
   And marketing deadlines are slightly different.
   Yeah.
   And being sat in the middle allows us to kind of balance
   those things up.
   But we do have deadlines, as well.
   Our deadlines aren't, like, your boss saying, "Deliver this
   feature by X," but our deadlines
   are, for example, there's going to be a new release of Ups
  ource next week, so I need to
   get a screencast of the new features in Upsource done by
   the end of...by, yeah, Tuesday next
   week.
   So you live a little bit closer to product cycles...
   Yeah.
   Yeah, definitely.
   ...versus just marketing initiatives.
   Right.
   I mean, but it's still a dovetail.
   It still dovetails into a marketing initiative.
   Right.
   But it's kind of once the engineering team have done what
   they're supposed to do, and
   we get involved with them earlier on, so I'm using early
   access versions of, like, most
   of the software, so I can also...I often end up feeding
   back, you know, occasional bugs
   come up.
   Yeah.
   Because that's the point about an early access program,
   right?
   Yeah, yeah.
   You're pushing the boundaries in some places.
   Yeah.
   So I'm, like, trying to figure out how new features work,
   and I'm, like, saying, "Oh,
   this doesn't appear to work," and often it's me going, "Oh,
   I didn't really get the right
   angle."
   Yeah.
   ...for that feature.
   Or sometimes it's, like, "Oh, we haven't quite thought of
   that," or maybe we can replace
   it this way.
   Mm-hmm.
   So I get to feed stuff back in there as well.
   So that's quite cool because it's...well, I mean, it's more
   like being a user than a
   developer, but...so I get to input a little bit into that.
   Yeah.
   But also, being a developer, you're quite sympathetic.
   You're not, like, "It doesn't work.
   It's a bug."
   Yeah.
   You're, like, "Well, I'm trying to document this feature,
   and I'm not really sure how
   it works."
   Yeah.
   And then you speak to the developers, and they're, like, "
  Oh, it should be like this."
   And you're, like, "Okay, great."
   And then because they can explain to me what it's supposed
   to do, and I can think, "How
   would a developer use this?"
   Then I can document it or screencast it or whatever in a
   way which will hopefully make
   it usable for future users.
   Okay.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
   me.
   Thank you very much.
   Thanks.

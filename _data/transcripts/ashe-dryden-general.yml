  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic.
   I'm here with Ash Dryden, who has been involved in the past with DrupalConf, but now she's
   involved with several other conferences in the PHP and Ruby world.
   Hi Ash, thanks for taking the time to sit down.
   Hi there.
   So you were involved with the DrupalConf in the past and other conferences in the PHP
   and Ruby world, and also you've had some interesting thoughts on Twitter about diversity and how
   we can have a more diverse attendance and participation in our conferences, but let's
   start with the conferences.
   How did you get involved with DrupalConf back in the day?
   Well, I've been pretty involved in the Drupal world for probably the past five, six, seven
   years, and I started out organizing more local camp style events.
   So I did Drupal Camp Wisconsin, and I got to know a lot of the people that are on the
   Drupal camp.

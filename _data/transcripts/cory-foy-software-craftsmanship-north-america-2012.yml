  sitting down with Corey Forey.\r\n Corey Forey leads the development practice for
  AtheLight in Florida,\r\n but he has a long history of speaking and teaching,\r\n
  going back to, well, Don Matt and Blackberry days,\r\n and you were a consultant
  there.\r\n But AtheLight is really well engaged in the community,\r\n or they make
  great efforts to be engaged.\r\n What is it that you're doing down in Florida\r\n
  to take what the culture is of AtheLight in Chicago to Florida?\r\n So I think to
  answer that, maybe stepping back a little bit\r\n of how I came to launch a Florida
  office of AtheLight.\r\n So my previous position, I was doing a tremendous amount
  of traveling.\r\n I did like 50,000 miles in January and February alone.\r\n In
  two months?\r\n In two months, right.\r\n A big chunk of that was flights out to
  India and things like that,\r\n but it was still a lot of travel, and I have family,\r\n
  and so we were trying to decide what the next step was going to be,\r\n and I have
  spent a lot of time working with organizations,\r\n and I wanted to be in a position
  where I had the opportunity\r\n to influence the technical direction of it\r\n if
  I was going to go work for a product company.\r\n And so I did one of the craziest
  things I've ever done\r\n back in like November or December.\r\n I did around 21
  interviews or 19 interviews in three days.\r\n Wow.\r\n Or you already used to travel.\r\n
  Well, right.\r\n So I flew out on a Monday morning and went to Silicon Valley\r\n
  and spent two days there, and I interviewed with like 11 companies,\r\n and then
  I flew an overnight red-eye to Chicago\r\n and interviewed with five or six companies
  here and different people,\r\n kind of exploring what was out there.\r\n And the
  thing that I found was I was interested\r\n because it's passionate communities
  that are out there.\r\n We hear a lot about Silicon Valley.\r\n We hear a lot about
  Chicago and New York and Austin,\r\n and areas, Denver, things like that.\r\n And
  I wanted to go out there to say maybe I need to be a part of this.\r\n Maybe there's
  something so amazing happening\r\n that I have to move my whole family out here.\r\n
  And what I found instead was a lot of smart people doing smart things.\r\n There's
  no doubt about that.\r\n But there was nothing that made me say, A, I have to be
  here.\r\n I have to relocate my whole family.\r\n And the second thing was I didn't
  see anything that said\r\n that we couldn't do something similar down in Tampa and
  down in Florida.\r\n Right.\r\n Right.\r\n Are there challenges?\r\n For sure there's
  challenges.\r\n So it led me to say that what I actually thought my next step was
  going to be\r\n was launch a company down there and bring the practices and principles\r\n
  that I strongly believe in and the value systems\r\n of how I think companies should
  be run to Florida.\r\n So then in March, early March, end of February, early March,\r\n
  I had a phone conversation with Micah Martin and Paul Pagel,\r\n who run 8th Light.\r\n
  And what we decided was,\r\n I called them initially just to say,\r\n how did you
  guys get started?\r\n And so over the phone conversation,\r\n what we found was
  there was a lot of,\r\n I'll use the word synergy, right?\r\n There's a lot of similar
  value systems between us.\r\n And they were trying to figure out how to grow the
  company\r\n and was a geographical growth a good next move for them\r\n and who
  would even do something like that.\r\n And so I kind of just said,\r\n hey, you
  guys ever think about opening a Florida office?\r\n And they're like, maybe we are
  thinking about that.\r\n So in March, we launched the Florida office down there.\r\n
  With just me and we're already up to six people\r\n and we're shooting for probably
  10 by October.\r\n I'm sorry, by summer of next year.\r\n So what kind of community
  things have you brought in?\r\n What do you identify as between yourself and 8th
  Light\r\n that you're taking down to Florida?\r\n What is it that you're doing down
  there?\r\n So I think there's three key things.\r\n I think first of all, for the
  companies that are down there,\r\n we're giving them an option that hasn't existed
  before.\r\n In the Chicago area or in a lot of other areas,\r\n there are craftsman
  shops that exist.\r\n We don't see that as much down in Florida,\r\n especially
  in the Tampa area that we're in.\r\n So we're giving companies a chance to see\r\n
  there is a company which cares about craft.\r\n There is a company which cares about
  delivering and value\r\n and those kinds of things.\r\n Secondly, what we're giving
  is developers down there\r\n an opportunity to say there's something other than
  just\r\n maintenance jobs or .NET jobs or Java jobs.\r\n There are companies who
  are out there who want,\r\n who, A, care about investing in you,\r\n and B, are
  on the cutting edge of pushing\r\n what the technology stack looks like.\r\n And
  I think that the third thing that we're bringing\r\n is the opportunity to share
  with the broader community\r\n interesting topics that they may not have otherwise
  heard of.\r\n So, for example, we've already run some code retreats down there.\r\n
  A couple years ago, I ran a Day of Ruby event.\r\n So it was a chance to teach people
  Ruby on Rails from scratch.\r\n And we had over 90 people.\r\n We'll show up for
  that.\r\n And so bringing, though, like another Ruby on Rails,\r\n Haskell 1, Erlang,
  NoSQL, those kinds of things,\r\n we're going to be able to sponsor those kinds
  of activities\r\n and opportunities down there for the broader community.\r\n And
  it sounded like, my next question is going to be,\r\n it seemed like well-received,
  there's been hunger for it,\r\n but you said there was 90 people that came out for
  a first event.\r\n That sounds like it was really well-received.\r\n It was.\r\n
  And that was a couple years ago before we started the 8th night down there.\r\n
  But there is that hunger, as there is.\r\n Anywhere, right?\r\n There's not, anytime
  something new that people, right,\r\n developers are the kind of people who are
  interested in learning.\r\n Right.\r\n And when you give them the opportunities,\r\n
  especially safe opportunities to do that,\r\n they seem to really want to latch
  on to that.\r\n And do you have any advice?\r\n I mean, because you're kind of going
  into an area that didn't have an established,\r\n or at least I don't understand
  it,\r\n they had an established community.\r\n Were there already user groups down
  there?\r\n Very much so.\r\n So Tampa is a very large Microsoft community.\r\n But
  there is a very active Tampa Ruby users group out of Tampa,\r\n led by Jason Frehley
  and Gavin Stark.\r\n And they do a phenomenal job with it.\r\n And they, knowing
  them has been a great asset saying there's a lot of support down there.\r\n And
  we do have some shops that are doing Ruby on Rails.\r\n And there tend to be a little,
  either very small boutique shops or broader,\r\n larger corporations that people
  have brought that concept in.\r\n For example,\r\n there's a company called WellCare,\r\n
  which is a medical health insurance company,\r\n company thing.\r\n And there's
  a guy,\r\n Brian Telson,\r\n who brought,\r\n who now is very involved with the
  Go programming language,\r\n but back then brought Ruby on Rails into the middle
  of a .net shop.\r\n So there are visionaries down there.\r\n And what we're trying
  to do is push forward and say,\r\n now there's a company down there who is practicing
  these principles and values as well.\r\n So it's an opportunity to say,\r\n this
  is an example of a company that's doing well,\r\n doing these things.\r\n Yes,\r\n
  that's correct.\r\n And that,\r\n okay,\r\n and then you can come and learn from
  us.\r\n That's right.\r\n Yeah.\r\n And have you guys done anything like the Aethel
  Universities that they do here in Chicago,\r\n or is that something you're still
  trying to work out?\r\n So it's both.\r\n What we do right now is we have an open
  invite to the community to come for Aethel University,\r\n and we streamed the Chicago
  one,\r\n primarily because we're still small and we weren't growing that,\r\n and
  we were trying to decide what we were going to do with it.\r\n I think what we're
  going to start looking into next year is opening up,\r\n opening that up broader.\r\n
  We're growing as a larger size group as well.\r\n So we'll be doing a mix of in-person
  plus streaming from the Chicago office.\r\n Do you,\r\n for somebody that's maybe
  in an area,\r\n it sounds like they did have a pretty robust community after all,\r\n
  but if you're in an area that maybe doesn't have a community,\r\n have you,\r\n
  you've been all over.\r\n Has there been any place where you could say there's,\r\n
  this is right for community,\r\n but they don't have something right now?\r\n I
  would have,\r\n you would have some advice for how to start making something happen
  in that area?\r\n So that's a good question.\r\n I think that there are places,\r\n
  certainly here at the SCNA conference that we're at.\r\n I've talked to people who
  have very small user groups,\r\n three or four people,\r\n and they're plugging
  along with that.\r\n And what,\r\n in fact,\r\n I was speaking two nights ago with
  the guys who created or who started,\r\n oh,\r\n they're going to bother me up in
  Wisconsin.\r\n The name completely escaped me for some reason.\r\n And they talked
  about how it grew out of a community effort where they had a very small user group
  and then they advertised on meetup.com.\r\n And I think that that's kind of the
  thing is people aren't going to go searching out necessarily for a Ruby users group,\r\n
  right?\r\n It's saying we're part of a broader technical group.\r\n This might be
  something you would want to be a part of.\r\n The other thing that we see a lot
  of our bar camps,\r\n right?\r\n So bar camps and code camps,\r\n low ceremony,\r\n
  low ceremony things in Tampa.\r\n We just had a bar camp code camp.\r\n They combined
  them and there was 1200 people who shut up for it.\r\n Wow,\r\n which shows that
  there is a thriving community there.\r\n And then it's how do we convert that?\r\n
  So I think in smaller communities,\r\n it's a matter of getting the word out in
  ways that you might not expect people.\r\n People may not search directly for a
  Haskell users group or Ruby users group doing looking at other users groups and
  doing presentations there.\r\n So going to a dot net users group and saying,\r\n
  hey,\r\n let me show you what I am.\r\n Ruby looks like,\r\n right?\r\n I think
  it was two or three years ago.\r\n I spoke at Microsoft's mix conference on iron
  Ruby of all topics,\r\n right?\r\n Right,\r\n right in the heart of that of the
  Microsoft land.\r\n And we've seen a shift in not because of my talking.\r\n No,\r\n
  no,\r\n but we've seen a shift in that,\r\n right?\r\n And so I think you're going
  to see people who are interested in mixing things up and combining efforts to to
  make interesting thing happen in smaller communities.\r\n So that brings us to one
  of the other topics we talked about was talking to different types,\r\n like,\r\n
  Microsoft and this is in the slam on Microsoft.\r\n It's just,\r\n it's an observation
  that a dominant developer usually calls themselves a dominant developer,\r\n a Java
  developer calls themselves a Java developer,\r\n or I should say even unloaded in
  the words that a person who works with dot net primarily calls themselves a dot
  net developer and they start to identify with that platform.\r\n A person predominantly
  works with Java calls themselves a Java developer and they put that and they identify
  with that.\r\n But the software craftsmanship,\r\n um,\r\n uh,\r\n conferences are
  a little bit more polyglot,\r\n little bit.\r\n We have people that do done that.\r\n
  We have people that do Ruby.\r\n We have people that do all different things.\r\n
  So yeah,\r\n yeah,\r\n and it's a,\r\n it's a little more polyglot ish.\r\n Is it
  different when you've gone and spoken to,\r\n um,\r\n uh,\r\n Microsoft oriented
  conference versus coming to like an SCNA here?\r\n Well,\r\n so I think,\r\n uh,\r\n
  to start off with,\r\n it's people identify with the groups.\r\n They are out of
  necessity because those communities tend to reward people who integrate very tightly
  with those communities and they see a lot of benefits and rewards out of them.\r\n
  One of the things that is interesting about what is actually happened this weekend
  over SCNA is if you listen to the different talks,\r\n what people are finding is
  that by being influenced by other programming paradigms,\r\n they're able to make
  their own code more pliable and cleaner and faster.\r\n Um,\r\n so I gave a talk
  yesterday morning on,\r\n uh,\r\n learning code.\r\n And one of the things I said
  was even within a code base,\r\n you can have different dialects and that's what
  coding standards are for.\r\n But,\r\n um,\r\n by looking at other paradigms,\r\n
  we influence how well we're able to communicate in our base language.\r\n So what
  the,\r\n the big thing that we're seeing in here is the influence of functional
  languages on object oriented programming.\r\n And,\r\n and so,\r\n so to your point,\r\n
  I think that yes,\r\n there is a lot of insular,\r\n culture for these conferences.\r\n
  Um,\r\n just like here at SCNA,\r\n we would probably not open our arms to somebody
  who was,\r\n you know,\r\n wanting to say,\r\n I do waterfall all the time.\r\n
  Yeah.\r\n Right.\r\n And I don't do any tests and I'm awesome.\r\n Right.\r\n Um,\r\n
  there,\r\n that,\r\n that's a natural part of what it is.\r\n And I think you have
  to look at different things.\r\n So it's not so much the community as the individual.\r\n
  And the,\r\n my stance on craftsmanship is the responsibility of learning and growing.\r\n
  Is not on the company,\r\n but it's on the individual.\r\n And so you have to make
  that decision and have to see that value that by learning different languages and
  different paradigms,\r\n you're going to be able to influence and become a better
  developer in your own language and in your own culture.\r\n Okay.\r\n Well,\r\n
  thank you very much for taking the time to sit down.\r\n Thank you very much."

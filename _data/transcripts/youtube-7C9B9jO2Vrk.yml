  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GoToConf 2014. I
  'm standing here with Alex and Joel who
   just gave a talk about remote pairing. Actually, what was
   the title exactly of the talk again?
   The title of the talk was "The Best of Both Worlds: Remote
   Pairing in Action."
   Or Pairing Without Pants. Pairing Without Pants, for sure.
   First, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. So,
   this topic, where is this coming
   from and what was the topic about? I mean, it's remote
   pairing, but what about remote
   pairing? Well, we have both been working for
   a company that is a startup that's entirely remote. For the
   past year, we've been working
   there, and everyone at the company pairs remotely, and it's
   a very new concept. Most people work
   in an office or they work from home by themselves.
   So, we wanted to expose people to this style of working
   that allows you to have interaction
   with people, but also allows you to have a more flexible
   schedule and work from your
   own environment. Okay. So, in the talk, were you giving
   tips
   or just more sharing anecdotal experiences? Yeah. So, it
   was more like the latter where
   we talked about the anecdotal experiences, the tools we use
  , some of the ones. It's not
   like we're saying, "Hey, use this exactly." We tried this,
   it didn't work or it worked
   well, this is why, and all the stuff that just helps make
   our day-to-day lives easier
   so we can focus on actually writing code. And the types of
   applications are you writing?
   Are they web applications, Windows applications? What
   platform are you starting from?
   Yes, they're mostly web applications and some backend stuff
  , too, for our clients,
   and we aim to get everyone using them on Chrome, but still
   are stuck with some IDA users as
   well, so. That doesn't die. But more for the developers who
   are working
   on the team, or are you saying that there's developers in
   the team that are still working
   on different... Oh, no. The developers in the team, we
   mostly
   develop our applications for Chrome. Okay. And everybody's
   probably, what, running
   MacBooks or are you a Windows shop? Yeah. So, we actually
   have a pretty standard
   setup where everyone has a MacBook Pro and two Thunderbolt
   displays, just so when you're
   screen sharing, you can kind of have the other person's
   screen up and also still have room
   to maybe Google some stuff on yours. And, you know,
   everyone's got their own kind of
   thing. So, everyone seems to be pretty happy with, you know
  , some Linux flavor. Some people
   might prefer actually using Ubuntu, but Mac's close enough
   that everyone can be happy with
   it. Right. And so, you're working collaboratively. Your
   teams are remote. I mean, are you global
   remote or...? We are. We try to stick within the four US
   time zones right now because we
   try to stick with a consistent workday and core hours for
   everyone, but that might change
   in the future. But right now, we are spread across the
   entire continent of the United
   States. Oh, yeah. That's interesting because it brings to
   the next question I was thinking
   about is office hours and having collaboration as a
   strictly developers working out between
   themselves or do you have, like you said, an office hours
   kind of...? So, right now,
   we pretty much are collaborating the entire day. We start
   at 9:00 AM central and then
   just kind of go to the day ends. But obviously, like,
   sometimes our team is an odd number
   because someone's out or someone's got something going on
   or just wants to work by the minute.
   So, they work by themselves for a little bit that day. So,
   we kind of make it work. We
   are, as we get more people on the West Coast and our team
   becomes this collaboration of
   people across multiple time zones, we are kind of having to
   move to that, the core hours
   concept where like, "Hey, try and be online between these
   hours." So, we can pair then
   and then either pair with somebody in your time zone at the
   other end or maybe just work
   on learning something new. Yeah. And that's interesting.
   You were saying about pair with
   somebody in your time zone where I wondered if there was
   some kind of striping maybe across
   time zones where, because people just overlapped more, they
   collaborated more.
   We haven't gotten to that point yet, but we are growing so
   rapidly. We've gone from
   one to 25 developers, 50 employees over the past year. And
   so, if we start to get bigger
   contingencies in each time zone, that might be somewhere
   away that we go.
   And you alluded to some tools that you use. You described
   that every developer has two
   monitors so that way they can pair and chat. What are some
   of the other tools that you
   use and recommend?
   So, we use, right now we're just using OS X screen share
   for screen sharing. I know
   there are a lot of other tools out there. One of the other
   ones we've liked was Screen
   Hero. As you said, you've used that before.
   We also use what's called Zoom for video conversations. It
  's similar to Google Hangouts that you can
   just quickly add people and people can drop. It seems to be
   a little bit better on your
   computer in the long run. And then we also use Slack, which
   is just a kind of like IM
   chat where you can have groups.
   Oh, it's like the Hip Chat.
   Yeah, it's very similar to Hip Chat. So, it's persistent.
   You can search it. You can have
   different groups. You can email or IM someone directly. So,
   those are the biggest tools
   we use. Did I miss anything?
   For our task boards and for transparency between the
   different groups, we use Trello. So, that's
   like kind of an online agile task board type system where
   you have user stories and you
   can move them across and see what people are working on.
   Right. And when you're doing your... Do you have any
   questions about that?
   Are you interagent planning meetings and things like that?
   Or how do you structure? So, on
   a day-to-day basis, you know, people pair off and probably,
   I'm presuming, have a daily
   kind of...
   Stand-up.
   Yeah, stand-up or sit-down, whichever the case might be.
   But how do you structure work
   in a longer cycle?
   We so far have had minimal structure. Basically, as the
   business finds more features they need
   to add them to the prioritized column. More recently,
   because work is piling up basically
   in different areas, we want to keep our task board more
   clean. And so, we've tried to move
   more towards one-week iterations, but still minimal process
  . We have a brief meeting where
   we move some cards over into the next week's work, but not
   a lot of... In previous jobs,
   we've had long strip planning meetings and things like that
  , and we don't want to get
   into that. So, we just keep away from it.
   So, try to keep it a little low formality.
   Yes, yes. Low formality.
   And from your presentation, did you present any specific
   tips or pitfalls that you would...
   So, the biggest pitfalls are, like we said, the time zones
   and whiteboarding solutions.
   And when you're working in an office with someone, it's
   really easy to just draw on
   a whiteboard, kind of get that going.
   It's a little bit harder remote, and mainly it's only
   harder because those tools are,
   like, iPad-specific, and so they require having an iPad,
   whereas things we use, like
   Zoom and Slack, are free. So, it's kind of like, let's have
   this low overhead.
   Okay.
   As far as tips, we kind of, like, we just try something,
   see if it works, and just
   don't stick to it. Don't say, "You have to use this." If it
   doesn't work, try something
   else.
   Be open for experimentation. Don't be too dogmatic, because
   a lot of this stuff is kind
   of new. I mean, the technologies are new. A lot of these
   things are new. I mean, you
   know, the whole idea of remote working is kind of new.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
   me. I really appreciate it.
   Thank you. It was great talking to you. Enjoy the
   conference.

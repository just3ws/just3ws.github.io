  It's Mike with Uteastic. I'm here at RailsConf 2014 and I'm
   standing here with
   Richard Schneeman who gave a talk earlier today called Her
  oku 2014: A Year in Review.
   He's also a Rails core contributor and he's created a few
   libraries over the
   years. One popular one was Sextant for helping Rails
   developers see their
   routes without having to run reg routes and another was W
  icked which was a
   multi-stop form wizard basically. Thank you very much for
   taking the time to
   speak with me. Yeah, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.
   So Heroku 2014: A Year in Review.
   We're only a few months into 2014. How do you how do you do
   that? That's that's
   pretty... So Rails is really important to us so I measure
   my personal
   years from RailsConf to RailsConf. Oh, okay. So it's a
   RailsConf standard year.
   Yeah. Okay, so it's like the RailsConf calendar. Yeah,
   there's like the Gregorian.
   Exactly, exactly. So yeah, a lot of really interesting
   things have happened this
   past year. We've been majorly focused on performance and a
   lot of a lot of things
   in that vein. Would you like to hear something about that?
   Yeah, no. Please tell me about your talk.
   Yeah, okay, great. So one of the biggest things that we
   released is PX Dynos.
   Okay. In the past, a dyno represents 512 megabytes of RAM
   and with a PX
   dyno instead you get, I want to say it's 8 gigabytes of RAM
   and six physical
   cores. Per dyno? Six physical CPUs, yes, per dyno. Okay. So
   that in the past you've
   always been able to scale up very horizontally very easily
   but if you're
   either using an application that has a lot of memory use or
   if you want a
   lot of concurrency per application, let's say you want to
   run a bunch of Unicorn
   workers or Puma workers per actual physical dyno, then you
   weren't able to in
   the past. But now we're focused a lot more on not just fast
   but consistently
   fast is kind of the key with that. So do you work with the
   dyno team or what
   is your role at Heroku?
   Okay, so I work with the Ruby task force. So Terrence Lee
   and I are on the
   languages team and we are in charge of the Ruby experience.
   That means we
   maintain the build pack whenever you do get push Heroku
   master and it's like all
   bundle install and everything flies by your screen. That's
   us. Okay. So if
   like deploying is slow. I definitely use your work. Okay,
   great, great. Many times, many,
   many times. We also luckily the company thinks it's a big
   part of that product
   is actually coming out and interfacing with the community
   and like finding real
   world people, you know, experiencing their pains or
   experiencing like, you
   know, oh, I love, you know, love your work and just
   figuring out what people like,
   what people don't like, how they're working and where we
   need to go in the
   future. So a lot of that as well. Okay. So I, we, yeah, we
   haven't, my, my team
   hasn't directly implemented the PX dynos product. But what
  's, what's, what's
   interesting to us is that once they came out with this,
   this product and they
   said, okay, we think this is important. We think this is
   valuable. They, they
   kind of came to each individual language team and said like
  , all right, well, how,
   you know, how should people on, uh, you know, Python
   optimize and maximize this?
   And they're like, all right, now that we have this, how do
   people on Ruby like
   really take advantage of it? Exactly. Exactly. And so, um,
   working in like
   hand in hand with some customers and, uh, doing a lot of
   experiments, um, had
   just one afternoon I was like, oh, you know, I wonder how
   many rescue workers I
   could run on, on a PX dino. And I was like, I was like, I
  'll just guess and
   start at 200. Oh, okay. I can run that many. Yeah. Let's
   just see how much
   until we can make it fall over. Yeah, exactly. Uh, and just
   playing around, uh,
   and ended up, so I wrote some documentation.
   For a rescue pool as a result of that. Um, and, uh, so it,
   it's really nice
   having access to, you know, customers who are kind of
   craving and demanding for
   these things and that are interested in actually working
   hand in hand with you
   in, in, in implementing them and getting real world
   feedback from them. So it's
   not just, it's, uh, it's also been able to take a lot of
   that and take it over
   to, um, other, uh, open source frameworks like, like rails.
   Right. Um, so yeah,
   so as far as the, the, uh, I'm actually gonna have to talk
   to you after this interview
   about, about the PX machine because my client does utilize
   that. So that's a, that's very
   interesting. Uh, but that's not too much for the interview.
   Uh, but as far as how did you
   come to be with Heroku X? I mean, you're, you're with Rails
   core kind of, can you tell
   us a little bit about your journey there? Did you, were you
   with Rails core before Heroku
   or? Uh, so, um, actually on the, uh, on the issues team, uh
  , currently. And, uh, I'm a
   big fan of Rails core. Uh, so I started working for Heroku
   about two years ago, a little over
   two years ago. Previous to that, I was working for a
   company called Gowalla. Uh, they were
   competitors to four square, got bought by, uh, got bought
   by Facebook and Facebook doesn't
   employ a lot of Ruby programmers. A little different
   platform. Yeah. Uh, and, um, like
   loved Heroku basically forever and they happen to have,
   have a, have a job slot. And for,
   uh, for getting involved with Rails, that was something
   that like,
   it was my dream to like have a commit into Rails. I
   remember like bumping into, uh, Aaron
   at that conference at one point in time and being like, how
   do I do this? And like, how
   does it even work? I was like, I want to add this, this, uh
  , it's like, you used to have
   get and patch and post in your log, say like saying this
   request is a get request. And
   for some reason that got like bumped or like no longer in
   there. Uh, or maybe it was an
   error message or something. And I was like, how do I do
   this? And like, he helped me out
   and I was like, this is great. And so I kept on trying to
   do that just whenever, you know,
   whenever, whenever I ran into like stubbed my toe on
   something, I'd be like, Oh, I'd
   like to actually like dig in and fix that. And just after
   time, um, yeah, like, uh, actually
   with, with sextant, the, um, the routes in the browser, I
   released that. And then, um,
   some of the, some people on rails core actually
   independently approached me and they were
   like, we love this. Can we, can you like, please work with
   us to like get it into rails,
   you know, rails proper. Uh, and like that, that was a
   pretty good experience and just
   hung out in, uh, in campfire.
   Yeah.
   I just did a bunch of work. And one day I got an email
   saying, Hey, like we've given
   you like, like collaborator access, like, you know, feel
   free to like close out, uh,
   close out issues and like, you know, do, do all of this
   stuff.
   Right. Right. Yeah. That's interesting. You're in the path
   that it's, it's a common path.
   It's get in there, do something, be helpful, reach out,
   communicate. And if you're doing
   good stuff, eventually you're probably going to become a
   trusted member of the team. And,
   uh,
   you just keep going at, uh, uh, Charles Nutter had kind of
   the same kind of story. He was
   just saw some issues and just wanted to help out. And
   eventually, you know, he's running
   J Ruby.
   Next thing you know. Yeah. I mean like very, like the, the
   famous quote, like writers,
   right. It's like open source contributors contribute. Yeah.
   Like just, you know, start
   out with documentation and like, it's a, it's not magic. It
  's a lot of work. Yeah. And,
   uh, so I'm just curious, working with, with the, uh, the
   Ruby, uh, team. I mean, you know,
   you probably have to do a lot of interaction with people
   outside the community. Um, you
   know, how's that, how do you balance that with your, your
   action, like going to conferences
   and talking, how do you balance that with, with working
   inside of your own organization?
   Oh, uh, it's really tough. Um, any kind of balance is
   really tough. I, I tend to be the
   kind of person that like, I get a problem and I like focus,
   like that's all I can think
   about that one problem. Right. Uh, so a lot of force is
   really important. I, I, I, I, I,
   uh, so a lot of forced context switching, um, a lot of, uh,
   uh, I mean, even, even at,
   um, even at conferences, just like having to, having to
   partition time and saying like,
   okay, you know what? Even like I'm here, I'm still, I'm
   still meeting people. Um, one trick,
   well, maybe it's not a trick, but at conferences, I think,
   uh, I think it's actually a mistake
   to try to go to every single session. Right. And you know,
   even if it's, especially if
   it's a multi-track session or, you know, conference, uh,
   you just can't. Uh, so I try to reserve
   percent of my time for just hallway interactions, bumping
   into people, uh, like having some
   great conversations, finding out what other people are, are
   working on. And I still love
   going to, going to the talks and hearing everything there.
   Um, but, uh, you know, so instead of
   working in my room, like I'll work outside and if somebody
   bumps into me and asked me
   a question about something I've been working on or they
   want to like, Oh, I've, you know,
   I've typically the best feedback is like unsolicited
   feedback. Like somebody is like, Hey, you
   know, I didn't like this one thing that happened.
   When I was pushing to Roku and I'm like, Oh, you know, I
   can actually do something
   about that. Like, uh, just, you know, recently we've had
   some, it's like people are like,
   Oh, I'm getting bad performance. And it's like, Oh, well
   like, let me take a look. And
   it's like, okay, Oh, you're, I see you're using web brick
   in, in production. And it's
   like, and it's like, Oh, well I didn't know that. And it's
   like, it just says rails, like
   it says rail server and it's, you know, it's just rail
   server. And it's like, yeah, but
   so it's a little bit more complicated. Yeah. And it's like,
   we, well, we, you know, and
   some warnings and some things that just, uh, this kind of
   like gradual trying to gently
   lead you to the path of happiness and Zen, you know, and
   this is a, probably a question
   on a left field, but I'm, since I mentioned Charles Nutter
   earlier, um, Hedius is a J
   Ruby, uh, maintainer. Um, the, there's, there's a trend
   towards, uh, moving towards, uh, using
   J Ruby or encouraging people to use J Ruby because of, uh,
   proper threading and, and,
   um, you know, uh, some of that support when you're long
   running processes. Is that something
   that, um, like you, are you using C Ruby or are you
   starting to encourage people to look
   at J Ruby with Heroku or is that, uh, so, so we've
   supported J Ruby for quite a while
   actually. And, um, we, we work with Charles quite a bit. We
   also, we have, uh, we have
   Rubinius. It's, it's actually technically not supported,
   but, uh, but it's still, it's
   still runs and it, and it works. Our support is actually
   provided through the Rubinius.
   Team. Um, yeah. And, uh, so I just generally wreck
   encourage people to like play and have
   fun and like, please, like if you're on MRI now, try MRR,
   try J Ruby. And like I've written
   when we first, when we first launched J Ruby, like I wrote
   docs on like migrating a rails
   app and, um, you know, just some, some things, uh, like
   even being a beat, trying that as
   a gem author, I was like, Oh wow, there's all of these gems
   that like just don't work
   on J Ruby.
   Because of like C extensions. And, um, and so like in the
   future, now that I'm working
   on gems, I'm very conscious of like how, like on Travis, I
   always test on J Ruby and always
   test on Rubinius.
   I was going to say like with Travis, you can have multiple
   targets. Exactly. You can, you
   can just say, test this on J Ruby or MRI one nine one eight
   two things like that. So you
   can get some of that flexibility.
   Yeah. And, and it's also the, the, the more people who try
   it, the more people who demand
   these.
   Things that are looking for them, the more knowledge there
   is out there. It's a lot easier
   today to switch over your app to use J Ruby. Um, I mean the
   community portion of it, typically
   my code has been relatively trivial. Most of my code just
   works and it's, and like over
   time, like it gets faster. Uh, and so like, I think every
   app is slightly different. Uh,
   so some people just want like running, you know, fast
   scripts and like, that's exactly
   like, you cannot beat the MRI, like boot up time.
   It is great and amazing. Like if you want to, if you can
   parallelize and you could,
   you're actually doing real Ruby, like number crunching,
   like J Ruby and threads. Like I
   still, but I still actually recommend MRI, even though we
   have a global interpreter lock,
   it's still not, it's not like a, you can still write
   threaded code, especially if you're
   using like a web server, um, or you're on the web, like you
  're using database calls,
   you're hitting APIs, all these other things. Didn't you
   create a background worker gem
   called threaded?
   Threaded or something like that.
   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Cause actually I, I spiked on
   that myself between sucker
   punch and, and, uh, threaded. Uh, so yeah. And being able
   to use that for background
   on, on J Ruby and save a few bucks on dynos was, yeah. Yeah
  . So I had forgotten about
   that. So even, even in other smaller aspects of my NAB as,
   as popular, you've done a bunch
   of open source. Sorry, that was, that was, you're talking
   about threads and I'm sitting
   there. Oh yeah. That's.
   That's something that's, you know, you can do that. You don
  't necessarily always have
   to spin up a rescue worker in a separate dyno or in, in, in
   Heroku. And, and, and that's
   the reason I was asking about moving to J Ruby is, um, you
   know, being able to do those
   things where I can consolidate and have one, like if I don
  't have a long running process,
   it's going to be kind of quick, but I want to be able to
   just return my response back
   to the clients. I can, uh, you know, run this thing in a
   separate, uh, thread. And, uh,
   earlier today you had a book signing. So you're, you're,
   you're moving into the world of being
   an author. You, you're a code writer and now you're a code
   book author.
   Yeah. A writer of many things. So the name of the book is
   Heroku up and running. It's
   a published on O'Reilly. Also a coauthor, uh, Neil Midd
  leton. He like, uh, it was, he
   actually started the book and then, and then brought me in.
   Um, so a lot of there, there's
   some other Heroku books out there and most of them just end
   up being do this, then do
   this, then do that.
   And it's just number one, all the majority of it is very
   technical, very rote. It's all
   online already and there's no explanation as to why. And we
   wanted something that was
   a little bit more timeless. Um, it's really got into the
   philosophy and, uh, it was published
   a couple, a couple of months ago and it's, it's not
   outdated yet.
   Oh, really? Yeah.
   Yeah.
   That's rare.
   It's, it's like, and that, it's like, that's the, that's
   like the golden standard of what
   we were going for.
   It didn't make it past the three month mark.
   Um, yeah, I, I think like just, yeah, we're right there. So
   we'll know in a few days whether
   or not totally like revamp these hierarchies if the book
   collapses. But, uh, and, and I've
   had, I've had some people tell me, uh, that like they
   played around a little bit with
   Heroku and there's a, there's a large number of things that
   they're like, they didn't realize
   or they knew that that was what happened, but not
   necessarily why it happened that way.
   Yeah. And even today at lunch, I was hearing one of the, uh
  , other, uh, employees from
   Heroku that's here was sitting at the table and people were
   just picking his brain and
   trying to understand. And it sounds like Heroku has done a
   great job of black boxing a lot
   and, and making a very low barrier to entry, but being able
   to go beyond that and say,
   okay, what can I really do with this, this thing that I
   have with this dino? What is,
   what is that? You know, and it's, and these obstructions
   sometimes, you know, they're,
   they're good for marketing and being able to just have a
   common language. But when somebody's
   really like, how do I get in there and do stuff and things
   I do every day, there's a,
   you can run,
   a Heroku run bash and I can actually get a bash shell into
   like an LS and CD and, you
   know, and I did not know that. Exactly. And it's like, I
   literally use this every single
   day. And I mean, so there's, there's some stuff in there
   like that, that like, it's
   like, there's a whole section on debugging and troubles
  hooting and like, you know, things
   that you might not have known before. But I mean, like we,
   we do love the, we, we aim
   to be as easy to use as possible. Um, and kind of my goal
   in life is to make that a little
   less black boxy, uh, and, and just make it a little bit
   more user friendly. Yeah. So
   like for the 90% use cases, it's a nice even path and it's
   nice and well trodden. But when
   you need to go off and just LS into your bin directory and
   see what permissions are on
   some bin. Yeah. And which, you know, which bundle and all
   of these other, like, so, so
   there's a lot of that stuff that's being exposed in the
   book and how to do that. Yeah. Because
   to, to be frank, people, when I said, well, uh, Heroku Dyno
   is a Linux instance. I'm going
   to boot to 10. I think it's where it's at right now or
   something. They were like, I
   did not know. Wait, it runs on a computer. I thought it was
   literally magic. I mean,
   it's almost like, is it, is it some kind of custom bespoke,
   you know, image that's its
   own kernel build or something like that. Yeah. You don't
   know, you know, it's, it's hard to tell those kinds
   of things unless you go in there and dig around. I had
   somebody come up to me. Oh, you, you inject
   a custom version of rails, right? No. Yeah. It's the
   version of rails you specify. I think
   something that comes from when I would rewrite your, your
   HTML and you're like, well, what
   really happened there? No, I just wrote a file and it went
   and also mounting some gems
   that used to do. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's changed. But
   anyway, again, thank you very
   much for taking the time. Heroku up and running. Heroku up
   and running. Right. And that's, I'm sure it's on Amazon
   and all those places. Wherever you find books. Thank you.

  Hi, it's Mike with Yooktastic. I'm here at GoToConf 2014
   sitting here with Emily, who's with ThoughtWorks,
   and she helps with some of their interactions with local
   technical community here in Chicago.
   Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
   So, Emily, what is it, how do you work
   with the user groups and what are some of the technical
   communities that you work with here in
   Chicago? So, I help to organize the Chicago Ruby Meetup.
   With Ray Hightower? Yeah, with Ray Hightower that's hosted
   in the Chicago office, the Chicago ThoughtWorks office. Ray
   does most of the work, but I think it's
   great to host it at ThoughtWorks every month. And I help
   encourage ThoughtWorks to attend and
   present. Okay, so you have like a proxy and through into
   ThoughtWorks so that we
   can actually help promote the community in ThoughtWorks, as
   well as give a place for
   the meetings to happen, right? Yeah, yeah. I think Thought
  Works is lucky to have a large space in the
   AM Center and it's a great way to give back to the tech
   community to be able to host events like that
   and give people a platform to talk about what they're doing
  . There's a lot of cool stuff going
   on in the Chicago tech community. Yeah, Chicago is pretty
   active and it's growing. What are some of the other groups
   that you work with?
   So I've been pretty actively involved with OpenGov back in
   1871 for the last year. ThoughtWorks occasionally sponsors
   that as well. So I've been helping evangelize the group
   inside ThoughtWorks and get people to attend and get
   involved in different projects.
   And that's the Open Government with Paul Baker and all the
   movers and shakers here in Chicago's tech community. So
   when you're working with these people, how does that work?
   Does ThoughtWorks approach user groups that it sees as
   being really active and special in the community? Or is
   there a way to apply? Like, hey, I have a user group. How
   can I work with ThoughtWorks?
   I think it depends on the user group.
   How we got into the arrangement we're in. I think in most
   cases, ThoughtWorks has been approached. I think we've been
   hosting Chicago really for years. I think originally, maybe
  , I don't even know the full story. I'll have to ask Ray
   next time we talk to him.
   It's been so long. It's lost the history.
   But I think it's nice to have that consistency of having it
   be in one location. And then for OpenGov back in 1871, some
   of us had gotten involved pretty early on.
   And they were like, oh, we're going to do this. And then we
   were like, oh, we're going to do this. And then we were
   like, oh, we're going to do this. And then we were like, oh
  , we're going to do this. And then we were like, oh, we're
   going to do this. And then we were like, oh, we're going to
   do this.
   So we're looking for some sponsors so that people don't
   have to pay for their own pizza every week. So that just
   happened to work out for us that time.
   And those are two very different styles of groups. And
   obviously, one is on-site, one is off-site. Does that
   change how you interact with those communities?
   I do think we sponsor. It's easier to sponsor things inside
   the office. And we have this great space in the Aon Center
   that's something that we can contribute.
   If people want to host events, we were able to host a
   really cool event leading up to PyCon this year where
   people would give practice talks.
   And it's not a, at least not yet, it's not a recurring
   event. But it was really cool. And they needed a space and
   they wanted to invite a lot of people.
   And we were able to provide that and help with the
   organizational details. So I think that's a way we can help
   out with people that want to get people together in the
   tech industry to talk about something or share what they're
   doing.
   So yeah, I think that's easier in some ways.
   Right, right. So when you're, like if I'm a user group and
   I'm like, well, I would love to be able to be associated
   with ThoughtWorks, do they, is there a specific place they
   should go to maybe try to reach me or should I give them
   your email address?
   That's a good question. It's usually just approach someone
   from ThoughtWorks. It doesn't really matter who. There's
   not a designated person.
   So if you can get an insider, then it's usually, yeah.
   See if the date that you're looking at is available and see
   if it's something that is aligned with what ThoughtWorks is
   trying to do.
   I think definitely we want to be actively engaged with the
   Chicago tech community. There's a lot of cool stuff going
   on and ThoughtWorks is doing a lot of cool stuff internally
   and we want to make sure we share as much as we can between
   us two.
   Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
   No, no, go on.
   If I'm a user group organizer, so you've been working with
   these communities for a while and I, you know, or maybe I'm
   somebody who's looking to,
   you know, I'm a user group organizer, so you've been
   working with these communities for a while and I, you know,
   or maybe I'm somebody who's looking to, you know, I'm a
   user group organizer, so you've been working with these
   communities for a while and I, you know, or maybe I'm
   somebody who's looking to,
   start a user group. What are some of the activities that
   you do that are, maybe somebody might not realize that they
  're going to have to do when they're running a user group?
   Like when you talk about the logistics of food and things
   like that, what are some tricks that you maybe have learned
   about how to manage those kinds of little details?
   I think just looking at how each event goes and make sure
   you use what went well and what didn't go well to feed in
   for the next one. That's really the best way to do it.
   That's really the best advice I can give. I think we
   noticed at Chicago Ruby pretty recently that there was some
   time before the talks would start where people weren't
   really interacting and we were getting a lot of cool people
   together, but then they didn't know each other and they
   didn't know what to do. So I talked with some of the
   organizers and we actually decided to, hey, what if we like
   rearrange the chairs and put them all in like different cl
  umps so that when people are sitting there, when they arrive
  , they sit with a group of people and they're not just like
   sitting auditorium style.
   waiting for the presentation, let's see how it goes. So we
   tried it for the next time and it actually worked pretty
   well. We asked people what they thought and we did find
   that people were interacting more. So I think looking at
   each group is different. So they're not like set rules that
   are going to work for everyone. It's going to really depend
   on your group size and what type of community you're
   attracting. But I think just looking at what's working for
   you.
   So just pay attention to what is and don't be afraid to
   experiment.
   Yeah.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to
   me. I appreciate it.
   No problem. Thank you.

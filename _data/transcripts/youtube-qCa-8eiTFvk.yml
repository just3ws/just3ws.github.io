  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2015. I'm
   sitting here with
   Jerry Cattell, who is one of the organizers with the
   Chicago DevOps Group.
   Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
   So Chicago DevOps,
   how did you get involved in that? And what is the DevOps
   group?
   Sure, I mean DevOps in general, at least I mean you can ask
   anyone, they'll have
   different definitions. For me it's generally about sort of
   breaking down
   silos and getting everyone in the company to sort of
   alignment and trying
   to achieve the same goals instead of development and
   operations sort of
   fighting each other historically. So yeah, I've been
   involved with the
   organization for I guess about three years now. Okay, so it
  's been around a little while.
   Yeah, it's actually been around probably for five years or
   so. Okay. It was
   registered with the actual meetup.com/devops. It was the
   first one.
   Yeah, that's a coveted title.
   Yeah.
   Yeah, so Martin Logan registered that long ago and yeah, he
   was the original
   creator of it. And yeah, it's, I basically got involved
   because I've always sort of
   straddled the line between development and operations and
   database
   administration. So for me it was just finally finding a
   place that I kind of
   belonged. But in general, I think it's a lot more about
   just improving the whole
   process of developing software at a company and stream
  lining that.
   And you mentioned that, you know, the group's been around
   longer than you've been a part of.
   So, and now you're an organizer, you know, so what brought
   you to the group?
   And then what kind of encouraged you to want to invest time
   into helping run the
   group? Sure. I mean, well, I went to a couple of them
   before, but like it just
   as an attendee to the meetups and always thought it was
   very interesting. Then
   Martin left to go to Seattle. Yeah. Leaving sort of a void.
   And so I had
   missed the talks on those subjects. And then so I thought,
   well, I might as well
   see if I can help on that. And yeah, I mean, I basically
   decided to put in the
   time just because I think it's a great group of people that
   attend the meetups
   and I tend to learn a ton just from hearing how they're
   solving their
   problems. Like any meetup group, I mean, you just want to
   understand, you know, how do
   you solve this problem that I'm having at work right now.
   What are you doing? And also, I mean, because as the
   organizer, part of your job is to find good speakers and
   stuff. And so a lot of
   that has been just sort of me being able to reach out
   beyond our community and
   actually start to talk to people that I would have never
   introduced myself to
   just, you know, at a crowd or a conference. I might not
   have talked to them in the
   past, but now as the organizer, I'm like, okay, now I
   actually have a reason.
   That's an excellent point. And that's actually one of the
   things that I've
   discovered as with UGtastic is you have a reason to go up
   to people that
   you're like, oh, I went to a conference and somebody gave a
   presentation. Okay,
   great. And then you just go off and do your business. But
   if you're a user
   group organizer, now you have, you know, a reason. Like,
   hey, would you come to our
   group? Yeah, it's like, I really enjoyed your talk and I'd
   love for you to give
   that talk to like the local community now. Right, right.
   From wherever I might
   be seeing them talk. And yeah, it's a, so that's been one
   of the huge benefits
   of being an organizer is just meeting all these amazing
   people. Yeah, it's open
   doors. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And speaking of other
   community events, you
   mentioned there's this DevOps Day, which you got the shirt
   on for. What is
   DevOps Days? So DevOps Days, it's been around for about
   five, almost six years
   now. Yeah. The first one took place in Ghent in 2009 and
   that was just sort of
   the start of it all. It's now been, I think, over 50 events
   worldwide. Chicago
   first held DevOps Days, they had their first DevOps Days
   last year. Okay. And so
   we're doing it all again this year in August 25th and 26th.
   So yeah, so it's...
   Is it a multi-day conference? Yeah, it's a two-day
   conference. It's got presentations,
   it's got Ignite talks, it's got open spaces. So it's like a
   good mix of lots
   of things. It's a much more participatory conference than
   the standard one
   where you just sort of go and listen to someone talk. It's
   much more about actually
   voicing the things you care about and actually talking to
   each other. Yeah. It's
   not the lecture style. No, not at all. So it's definitely a
   great conference that I
   love going to. And so when we finally got one here in
   Chicago, we were thrilled and
   then we had a great response last year, so we decided to do
   it again this year. So if
   I just Google DevOps Days? DevOpsDays.org will get you to
   the main website and from
   all our stuff. And right now, actually, our call for
   proposals is open, so anyone
   who wants to do that. Okay, so DevOps Days and then it's,
   you said it runs in
   several cities and different states at different times?
   Yeah, I mean, Austin was
   just last week. I think Toronto was actually this week. Oh,
   so it's all over the
   place. Yeah, and like I know Minneapolis is in July. We're
   in August. Yeah, and
   they're just great events to go to. Okay, great. Well,
   thank you very much for
   taking the time to speak with me. Thank you. Appreciate it.

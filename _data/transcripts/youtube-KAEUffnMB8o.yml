  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2014. I
  'm sitting here with John and Coleman who
   gave a talk on building an ecosystem. Well, thank you very
   much for taking the time to speak with
   me. Can you tell me a little bit about what your talk was
   and what does it mean to build an
   ecosystem? Sure. Well, we focused on building a program of
   different products that made this
   grocery and restaurant store really get off the ground in a
   short amount of time. And so that
   meant a collection of bespoke built software and products
   for that need, but also purchasing things
   off the shelf, tweaking them and customizing them for the
   client. And then we also built the services
   that stitch all of those together. So was that like a live
   coding thing or were you mostly walking
   through? So yeah, it was a series of
   stories.
   The different products that we built and different
   challenges we faced with kind of the general theme
   that we didn't need to have all the problems figured out up
   front. What we had was a good
   process and that helped us figure out the problems as they
   arose. So that spanned all the way from
   technical to experience side problems. Yeah. So part of our
   talk was how we
   switched between agile and lean principles as we needed to,
   to accomplish those different goals.
   Okay. And, you know, the word ecosystem, and this is kind
   of a theme we've,
   have very loaded terminology in this conference. I've
   noticed that is that ecosystem can mean a lot
   of different things. What do you mean by ecosystem?
   Oh, that's a tough question. I think I see it. And I think
   we both will have answers to this. I see it
   very much almost as a living, breathing program. Like I
   think why it, why it means ecosystem to me
   is because if we have an established program and we add
   something to it, it doesn't mean that we're
   going to have a solution. It doesn't become as simple as
   making another product or tool. What
   you have to do then is tweak something in every other
   element to best integrate that and make it
   all flow together. And because all of these things become
   intertwined and dependent on each other,
   and, and because they change as a whole rather than an
   individual, that's why it means ecosystem
   to me. Yeah, it, it really, the distinction is that iter
  ative doesn't mean piecemeal,
   right? So we need to change something in one product. Often
   that would have ripples and we had a lot of
   different products to ultimately serve this large
   restaurant space, as well as a lot of operational
   needs on the, on the client backend. So when we changed one
   product, for example, the quick payment
   app that we met made, what that meant is we also needed to
   change things about the physical space.
   We needed to change things about the way our web services
   consume that information. And that's why
   it's an ecosystem, not just a collection of products.
   Right. So, so this isn't simply just a matter of, oh, I
   need a blog, bring in WordPress.
   It's more of what, what is it that this, this company is
   trying to do with this specific product?
   What's our end need and which services can we just pull in
   or do we have to create? Like,
   how do you decide whether to go with the create versus
   build versus buy?
   Well, I think, you know, uh, one of the key components to
   that was we had
   a really strong strategy and product management team. Um,
   and everyone participated in that. So
   it was certainly led by people with experience in that
   field. Um, but we were all integrated
   into those choices. And so we made really intentional calls
   when we would. So for example,
   we bought the POS system, um, we licensed revel and
   customized it for our client as an iPad point
   of sale system. Yeah. Um, and then, but we did build those
   services from scratch and we built,
   uh, the market pass app from scratch, um, which works with
   rebel. And so we really also put those
   together and made them play off of each other. So there's a
   lot more of, it's more glue than
   that's, that's the bespoke code or I think you have to
   build the glue as well. So it's like,
   it's not like doing just WordPress. Yeah. It's like, you
   also have to build the browser, right?
   Okay. So it can be, it really depends on, um, what the need
   of that specific
   customer. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And the, the value of
   building the glue to extend that metaphor
   is that when we realize that there is something that we can
  't buy that we need to really kind
   of complete an experience or complete a specific flow, we
   can then build that and know that we'll
   integrate well. So, and I think, uh, something that might
   make this context a bit clearer is
   that we were building these series of products for a
   physical space. So you can even technically
   think of them just like real objects, right? Because it was
   for a restaurant grocery hybrid,
   all of these things actually went somewhere and were picked
   up in touch by people weren't
   necessarily invisible. Well, so this even, it, it led to
   decisions about
   who might be doing your, your supply for groceries and
   things like that. Not just,
   not just which software do you use for the point of sale or
   for the menu online system,
   but actually how do you get the materials to cook the food
   to send to, you know, to serve
   your customers. We realized, um, towards the end of the
   program that, uh, we had the customers as
   a user base, but we also have the associates, the people
   who are actually working there as a user
   base. And we ended up spinning up an entire another stream
   of work around training and self-service
   tools to let the.
   Associates do the best that they could to best serve the
   customers, right? Because the whole
   goal was to use technology to empower a great customer
   experience. And sometimes that meant
   just empowering other humans to help with that. Right. And,
   uh, so this sounds like it's a lot
   more like a few years ago then like Yahoo pipes. And there
  's, if then this, if this,
   then that's kind of in interactions between different
   services and APIs,
   this is a lot further beyond that. And it goes into more of
   the depth of actually building.
   I'm going to have to edit that one out because I can't even
   think.
   Building a store.
   Building a store.
   I mean, it's building a store.
   Building a physical place that is integrated with
   technology.
   This is going beyond just, oh, I have a website, and I'm
   going to maybe do some dropshipping.
   And it's how that website affects what's going on in the
   store, how those apps affect what's going on in the store.
   Is there anything that, you know, when you came out of this
   product and you're now looking back and you're going to
   write this presentation,
   what were some of the highlight things that were kind of
   really surprised you or you learned
   and that you wanted to share in this presentation?
   Like, was there one thing in particular that...
   Oh, that's a hard question.
   I'll give you two things.
   Well, you do one, I'll do one.
   Okay.
   I think one of my favorite things is that we released the
   Rich Tree app, which is currently in the iOS and Android
   store.
   We also released an actual plastic card version of this app
  .
   What I'm quite proud of is that we created both a very
   accessible version, which is free, and anyone can pick up.
   And this wooden card will act as your loyalty card.
   Requires no technology.
   Right.
   So we don't always need to use tech to solve problems, but
   we were able to create a super accessible and free item,
   which contained our core value proposition without eroding
   the value that the mobile app created.
   The mobile app allows you to do things in more real time.
   It also allows you to pay.
   Okay.
   And also...
   It also uses the core feature of loyalty.
   So we didn't have to compromise on the value of either of
   those, and we're able to basically create something for the
   super connected user
   and leverage that tech to have a stronger store experience.
   But we didn't compromise on the core value prop by having a
   very accessible and free wooden card that you can come in
   and take.
   So it sounds like you recognize that maybe the be-all, end-
  all isn't to force technology onto people.
   Absolutely.
   It's just a dress that sometimes people just like.
   You have a thing.
   You could be as exact as, you know, we realized not
   everyone had an unlimited data plan.
   Right.
   Like, we just realized things would go wrong, and you
   shouldn't be forced to have to do all these things to
   access some of our great tech.
   Great.
   And you were going to say...
   Oh, yeah.
   So mine actually was the...
   We built an app, an iPad app, that was all of our menus for
   the restaurant that was for the bar.
   So the restaurant is generally basically a food court where
   all of the stations,
   or in fact, owned by the same restaurant, except for the
   bar, which is a full-service bar, table service, everything
   else.
   And they can also order from any of the other stations.
   And we became so well-known, essentially, for being pivot-
  friendly in the way that we were doing things,
   that they came to us 10 hours before store launch, like
   store first opening, and said,
   we need a menu for the bar.
   And we were able to, because of the way we had built
   everything,
   because of the way that we were considering the entire
   experience,
   and knew that we were...
   going to be wrong and going to be learning up until opening
   day,
   that it was kind of a ridiculous request, but it was
   actually doable.
   We managed to, because we could just consume the same web
   services,
   because we could use the same exact styling that was used
   in the menu boards and elsewhere with a few tweaks,
   we were able to actually get this thing out the door,
   which was not only kind of put the cherry on top of this
   holistic user experience,
   that used technology not as kind of your flashbang.
   We were in an Apple store.
   We weren't selling technology.
   We were selling food.
   We were selling good customer service.
   And that was kind of one of the last things that really
   felt good in kind of,
   we are actually empowering our customers to really have a
   great time here,
   to enjoy the food, not to look at the app, but to know what
   food they can buy, quite literally.
   And I have to even wonder if that ability to deliver such a
   time-sensitive solution
   helped build more trust from your direct clients,
   and know that...
   Absolutely.
   It's part of how we got the request in the initial spot.
   I mean, we had to really earn the right to be their tech
   partner.
   We didn't walk in.
   It wasn't based strictly on our brand.
   They didn't come in and ask us to just take charge of all
   of these things.
   We earned it over time.
   And the Lean and Agile process helped us to really do that,
   because we were able to make
   changes based on their changing business needs, because
   they had a six-month deadline.
   This store was going to open whether our tech was ready or
   not.
   Yeah.
   We had to hit that construction deadline, and they didn't
   have everything figured out.
   And so, they needed a group like us that could change over
   time, where they didn't have to
   present us with all of the answers to get started.
   Great.
   And just to close, you said that there is an app on the iOS
   store that people can go
   and check out to kind of see what...
   Yeah.
   Yeah.
   If you search Rich Tree, R-I-C-H-T-R-E-E, it'll come up.
   Unfortunately, if you don't live in Toronto, it'll be
   pretty much useless.
   But like I said, the technology is in service of the
   customer experience, which means if
   you're not in the store, the app, which I can actually show
   you, the app, which looks
   like that...
   Sure.
   I'll hold it up.
   Yeah.
   It's a...
   So, it's a quick pay barcode.
   A QR code there.
   Exactly.
   Yeah.
   Which means that if I'm not in the store, this app is
   basically useless.
   Right.
   Which is the point.
   We didn't make an app that you could play with, because we
  're not...
   This company doesn't sell apps.
   They sell food.
   Okay.
   Yeah.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
   me.
   It was really interesting.
   Great.
   Thanks so much.
   Thanks.

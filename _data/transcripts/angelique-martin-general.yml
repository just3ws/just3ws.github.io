  from 8thLight.\r\n She is, historically you've worked with the XP Universe and the,
  well the XP Agile Universe when it was rebranded because Agile was the thing.\r\n
  But now you're working with SCNA, Software Craftsmanship North America. It's a conference
  that's been, what, this is our fourth year?\r\n Yes, it is our fourth year.\r\n
  Can you tell me a little bit about SCNA?\r\n So SCNA stands for Software Craftsmanship
  North America. It's organized right here in Chicago.\r\n It will be held November
  9th and 10th at the Aon Center.\r\n It's a two-day conference. We'll have about
  14 speakers, including Robert Martin, Corey Foyle, and many other names that I can't
  think of right now.\r\n Oh, remember the roster, right now.\r\n Yes, Gary Bernard.\r\n
  There's two sets.\r\n Sarah, Sarah Ellen and Sarah Gray, Leon Gersing, I won't be
  able to remember the full team, Brian Merrick, that I can quote, and I can't think
  of the other one, but it's all on the website.\r\n That's okay. You know, people
  can go to the site and see all of that information. But can you tell me a little
  bit about what is SCNA?\r\n So SCNA is a conference that aims at gathering people
  that care about their craftsmanship.\r\n They care about their craft. They care
  about improving themselves. They care about contributing to the community and meeting
  with their peers and hopefully exchanging and teaching each other.\r\n Okay. And
  this is what, you said the fourth year or so?\r\n Fourth year, correct.\r\n And
  traditionally, this was something that you shared responsibilities, 8th Light shared
  responsibilities with Optiva for you kind of handing it off back and forth.\r\n
  Right.\r\n And now this year, fortunately this year, that Optiva was acquired was
  an 8th Light year, so we're good this year, but...\r\n Correct. Well, Groupon Engineering
  was still very involved in the planning of 8th Light this year. As a matter of fact,
  they helped considerably to secure the program. So they're still a main sponsor
  and they're still very involved.\r\n Okay. That's good.\r\n The year before, when
  8th Light was in charge of it, you did this kind of, you went, you know, one of
  the things I liked was you went beyond just the day-to-day.\r\n Like most conferences
  seem to be, okay, we have the conference, we have the sessions, we're going to maybe
  have an after party, but it's usually local, you know, or right inside of the facility
  where you organized like a field trip.\r\n Correct.\r\n Did you get any feedback
  from that from people?\r\n Well, I got some really positive feedback.\r\n The idea
  behind this was to take, you know, to have a, instead of a banquet where you would
  get a DJ and gigs really stand up and dance, we were going to take people out into
  buses so that they could network, have a chance to discuss the topics that the speakers
  had rushed on that day, for instance, and we celebrated different areas of Chicago.\r\n
  Yeah, well, that was one of the things is from people that had spoken.\r\n With
  me, from out of town, they were kind of saying that it was, it was, they were excited
  there was a chance to go and see things that they might not have known to go see,
  because I remember that this past year's SCNA, some of the people were kind of,
  from out of town, they were kind of floundering.\r\n That's, that's one of the hard
  things for introverts.\r\n Sometimes we will just go back to our hotel room and
  hack or stay local or not explore.\r\n Correct.\r\n You'll see the hotel room and
  the conference hotel.\r\n Yeah.\r\n Yeah.\r\n And so, I mean, the other thing was.\r\n
  You know, you were in the city one year, and then you're out near the airport.\r\n
  Was there any logistical things that made it more difficult being in the city or
  being outside of the city?\r\n I think that's primarily from the fact that one year,
  you know, we used to alternate.\r\n Tiva would organize, and then the next year
  we'd be in flight.\r\n And at the time, in flight was mostly located in the suburbs.\r\n
  So we had decided, and you know, for.\r\n For cost reasons as well, to take the
  conference outside of the city.\r\n It was the very first year that it was going
  to be a two-day conference.\r\n So to minimize the risk, we decided to take it out
  of the city.\r\n And we did it by the airport with a connection to the city within
  the parking garage of the hotel.\r\n Yeah.\r\n So it was easy to get out there.\r\n
  Correct.\r\n Okay.\r\n But cost was one of the big things you were saying.\r\n Yeah.\r\n
  You put events together.\r\n You know that.\r\n We don't do this for the money.\r\n
  Right, right, right.\r\n Yeah, but there's still a lot of money that changes hands,
  but mostly it's outgoing.\r\n Okay.\r\n Well, thank you very much for taking the
  time to speak with me, and looking forward to SCNA.\r\n Okay.\r\n Thank you."

  Cully Smith who has run a user group on the University of Wisconsin campus and\r\n
  he had an interesting perspective on the needs of a student user group\r\n versus
  those of some of us who are out in the professional world where we\r\n typically
  consider the attendees of a user group. So thanks for sitting\r\n down. What was
  it that was unique about running a user group for\r\n students than when you came
  out of college coming into MAD Railers?\r\n What was your experience? Yeah, so the
  users group was geared toward not only\r\n students but also professionals on campus.
  So in Madison, Wisconsin we have\r\n MAD Railers which is an established users group
  and it meets on Monday\r\n evenings. The first perspective that we were trying to
  offer as a MAD Railers\r\n group, as well as a lot of other MAD Railers, was to
  create a user group for\r\n other users groups. It's geared towards startup companies,
  towards enterprises,\r\n things like that, but the campus has specific needs. A
  lot of times they're\r\n dealing with not new products, but they're dealing with
  how to write\r\n software with existing things in place. So trying to come in and
  change the\r\n culture to be more agile, to be more lean, was simply not feasible.
  It was out of\r\n their control. If you have a startup or a business, you might
  get some headway in\r\n doing that. Or if you have a small department,\r\n but quite
  often on campus you didn't even have a department. You had one\r\n individual working
  on a code base. So what we were trying to do was create a\r\n resource for the campus
  to use to say these are some of the products that are\r\n being developed across
  the campus and where are some ways that we can\r\n consolidate our efforts and to
  do some knowledge sharing. Because if someone\r\n else is building an application
  very similar in say the Department of\r\n Medicine to something that someone else
  is doing in the Department of\r\n Communications and those people don't have a way
  to\r\n talk, a central location to meet, a lot of times there's going to be wasted
  efforts.\r\n So instead of just having a newsletter, it's like hey let's get everybody
  together\r\n casually let's talk about this cool stuff and then let it naturally
  let them\r\n talk and get to know each other in a less controlled, less structured\r\n
  environments. You're not in a meeting, you're in a user group.\r\n Yeah, we started
  off with just a mailing list. So we were using a mailing list and\r\n we found that
  there was there were some topics that just did not translate well.\r\n And we wanted
  and people also wanted an opportunity to learn. They wanted to go\r\n in and see
  someone present on test-driven development, but not under\r\n the preconceived notion
  that it was going to be something that you were\r\n going to be able to implement,
  but just what are some of the ways that we can\r\n start doing test-driven development.
  And also on campus, even though this was a\r\n Ruby on Rails meetup group, we were
  opening it up to people that were from\r\n coming from different backgrounds, from
  Java, from .NET, from other things.\r\n And so it was sort of language agnostic.\r\n
  So even though you were underneath the label of a Rails group, it was, hey,\r\n
  whoever's cool, whoever wants to come in and learn about these things, these\r\n
  concepts, not necessarily Rails, but concepts that are popular on Rails, they were
  all\r\n welcome to come in. Yeah. Did you get some people like that? Quite a few
  people came\r\n in just that were doing JavaScript stuff. Okay. So on campuses,
  mobile is a very big\r\n concern right now, writing things for mobile apps, because
  students are walking\r\n around with phones, with tablets from class to class. And
  so you could either be\r\n doing iOS or Android or something for native apps, but
  a lot of people were\r\n building their apps and then just having like a JavaScript
  framework, like PhoneGap\r\n or something like that, so that they could wrap it.
  So we had quite a few people\r\n that were interested in using test-driven development
  and agile approaches to the\r\n JavaScript side. So when you came out of college
  and you moved out and you moved on from the school,\r\n the university environment,
  out into a professional environment, I should say, were you, I should\r\n say actually,
  were you a student at the university? I was actually an employee. Oh, you were an\r\n
  employee. Yes. Okay. And you were, but you were trying to reach out to students?
  We had\r\n students, and we were trying to expose students, because that was one
  of the things that we\r\n had learned, that a lot of students that were going through
  a traditional computer science\r\n program weren't exposed to things like test-driven
  development, like agile, and things like that.\r\n They were learning data structures,
  they were learning things like that, but they weren't\r\n understanding how that
  was going to be implemented. Right. And the Madison community has a number\r\n of
  startup companies. They have Bendyworks, which is a software consulting shop, and
  a\r\n number of other software consulting, or software startup companies that were
  wanting to hire\r\n people, but there was a huge gap between what the students were
  actually learning at school\r\n and how they were going to be asked to practice
  it. So yeah, we did reach out to students\r\n just to say, well, this is what pair
  programming is, this is what agile is, this is what test-driven\r\n development
  is. Yeah. There were\r\n students that were learning data structures, and schema,
  and root, and Java, and then coming\r\n out and having to figure out how to write
  up an application. Yeah. It's a big gap. Yeah.\r\n So, but when you came out of
  working in the university environments into the more traditional\r\n business startup
  culture, what kind of became of the user group on the campus? We needed\r\n someone
  to come in and take over and support it. I think that there are still efforts to\r\n
  get it going, but the problem, I think, is if you don't have someone that, you know,\r\n
  has the vision to get it done. Right. So, it's still sitting there, and at this
  time,\r\n it's mainly just a practical matter. I don't have the same permissions
  to book rooms on\r\n a campus, so even though I still would have a great interest
  in doing so, I would need\r\n someone on campus. So, it's more of a bureaucracy
  kind of holding you back. Yeah. So, okay.\r\n Well, thank you very much for taking
  the time to sit down. Yeah, thank you. Appreciate it.\r\n Thank you."

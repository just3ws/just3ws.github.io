  Hi, it's Mike with Utesc. I'm here again at GOTO Conf 2015,
   and I'm standing here with Charles Nutter,
   who's giving a talk called Beyond the JVM. It's a tongue tw
  ister.
   I've been saying so many long titles today that trying to
   say a short title is actually more confusing.
   Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
   me.
   Sure.
   So, Beyond the JVM. What is Beyond the JVM?
   Well, this is a talk I've kind of been working on for a
   while,
   just to show people that the JVM is evolving and that a lot
   of the problems they may have heard about are starting to
   be solved.
   In this talk, I kind of took the approach of talking about
   the work we did on JRuby for the past nine years,
   the challenges of getting JRuby to run on the JVM and be
   compatible,
   and then threaded that story through a few different areas
   that the JVM is improving.
   I think it went pretty well. People seem to appreciate the
   work that's being done.
   Yeah, and I mean, what are some of the examples?
   Like your JVM...
   JRuby is your domain, but are you looking at strictly the
   JRuby aspects or how JRuby improves off of this?
   Or is it just general JVM stuff that...
   Well, it ends up being very general.
   The problems that we had to solve are problems that
   developers on the JVM have had to deal with for a long time
  .
   The three areas that I actually went into, I talked about
   how Ruby has tons of method calls.
   I mean, everything's a method call all over the place.
   And using Invoke Dynamic, Java 7 features to optimize
   things a little bit better,
   make it possible for Ruby code to get some of the same JIT
   optimizations that Java does.
   We also had a strong need to be able to call native
   functions.
   There's a lot of Unix and POSIX stuff in Ruby that has to
   be essentially the same behavior.
   We could emulate all of it or port all that sort of code
   and all that logic,
   but it ends up being much more compatible and a better
   experience for users if we can call native code.
   So we've worked for years on a native integration library
   and some wrappers around that
   to pre-bind a bunch of POSIX functions, make it easy to
   call them anytime.
   So does that mean that it makes JRuby on Windows even more
   accessible
   because of the abstraction of those system lib type calls?
   Right, right, exactly.
   So we're able to match Ruby's performance exactly the way
   that it would be on any given platform.
   So if there's platform-specific cores...
   Quarks, not necessarily bugs or problems, but quarks in how
   file operations work
   or quarks in how it deals with unmanaged memory or native
   memory,
   those things we can do without having to write any native
   code.
   We just write a little bit of Java code, call through our
   native integration layer, JNR,
   and we get the native behavior out of that.
   Interesting.
   And on a side note, as we were talking about the JVM,
   it got to me thinking about some of the resources.
   Recent changes, and you may or may not have an answer,
   but with the recent changes in the .NET CLR now being
   launched on OS X and Linux
   and Microsoft seeming to make a push,
   there had been the IAMRuby project that kind of died.
   Have you looked at the .NET stuff
   and looked at how maybe JRuby might benefit from any of
   these new advancements?
   Yeah, actually, for a couple years,
   I went to the lang.net event that Microsoft hosted
   where they had language designers, runtime designers, VM
   folks all come to Redmond
   and meet up and talk about what they're doing.
   I went with John Rose and did a presentation.
   John Rose is the lead of the Hotspot compiler team.
   We talked about basically how Hotspot works internally,
   what it's able to do optimization-wise.
   They were able to talk about things that they're doing in C
   Sharp
   and how it may make it work and how it fits into their VM.
   I really wish we had more.
   More of those events.
   There's no more lang.net as far as I know.
   We still have the JVM Language Summit
   and get the C Sharp and Microsoft folks over there once in
   a while.
   And there's events like this that are cross-discipline,
   cross-language.
   So it's nice.
   I had a chance to talk with Mads a little bit earlier
   about some of the new C Sharp stuff.
   Yeah, and you might not think about an event like this
   might bring together two disparate houses.
   You know, I don't know which...
   I've been watching Dune a little bit too much lately,
   but I'm thinking, you know, which one's House Harkonnen?
   Yeah, exactly.
   But, you know, I'll just say JVM is a tradies
   and we'll just leave it there.
   Or maybe X, I don't know.
   But it's good to see, like, some of these advancements
   and it's good to know that there's cross-pollination going
   on
   even at a high level of people who are inside of the
   project.
   Right, right.
   Despite the perceived, you know, animosity between the two
   platforms.
   John Rose, I think, mentioned it.
   He said it's like going to a parallel universe
   where you go and talk to them.
   It's the same challenges and the same...
   It's the same problems
   and it just makes sense for us to all work together on them
  .
   So, actually, if that means that it's mirror-mirror,
   you've got the goatee.
   So who's the good guy?
   Yeah, who's the good me on the other side?
   Well, thank you very much for taking that.
   We'll leave that as a mystery.
   Thank you very much.

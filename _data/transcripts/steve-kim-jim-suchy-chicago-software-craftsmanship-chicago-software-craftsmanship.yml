content: "- Hi, I'm Mike.\r\n I'm sitting here with Jim Suchi and Steve Kim\r\n from
  Chicago Self-Worker, Chicago Self-Worker Craftsmanship,\r\n not Self-Worker Craftsmanship
  McHenry County.\r\n That's a whole different interview.\r\n So, hi guys.\r\n Thanks
  for talking with me.\r\n Can you tell me a little bit about what you're doing here\r\n
  with Chicago Self-Worker Craftsmanship\r\n and what the community is\r\n and how
  long you've been leading?\r\n - Well, we started back in January\r\n when we took
  it from Activa.\r\n - Yeah.\r\n - The idea is Chicago Self-Worker Craftsmanship\r\n
  will have not necessarily speakers for the talks,\r\n but hands-on sessions\r\n
  that people can engage with and participate in.\r\n - Right.\r\n So, like most other
  talks,\r\n all the places are really just talk.\r\n Have you had lots of presentations
  you've been doing\r\n like labs and grand dory sessions and things like that?\r\n
  - Grand dory sessions,\r\n TV sessions, sparrings.\r\n - And competitions.\r\n -
  Right.\r\n And when you say sparring, what do you mean sparring?\r\n - Code competitions.\r\n
  - Oh, code competitions.\r\n - So, our first meeting, we had like a session\r\n
  where we had the server running\r\n and people coded against it.\r\n - See, we're
  actually here for a meeting\r\n and we are in the middle of the walking area,\r\n
  but we will continue.\r\n So, you actually had a code competition?\r\n - What was
  it?\r\n - Ants, so you controlled an ant up on the screen\r\n and there was a simple
  REST API\r\n in order to meet your ant.\r\n - Okay.\r\n - And then you could code
  to unlock the ant.\r\n - Some logic to kind of make it default\r\n and things like
  that.\r\n - Or win.\r\n - And so, like, when are you meeting specifically?\r\n -
  We decided on the second Wednesday of the month,\r\n but it's definitely flexible.\r\n
  I mean, depending on the session,\r\n there's not necessarily a speaker, whatever.\r\n
  So, the leader, whoever's leading the session.\r\n - Yeah, so like today, it's a
  Java session.\r\n Do you guys share responsibility for running the group?\r\n Or
  how do you, how do you guys manage coordinating?\r\n So, you guys have a meetup
  site now.\r\n - We have a wonderful spreadsheet that we use.\r\n - Yeah.\r\n - High
  tech, very high tech.\r\n And that's what we've been using.\r\n It's worked out
  great, actually.\r\n - Yep, okay.\r\n - I'll edit it out, or I won't.\r\n I will
  just, can I have Jim here for a minute?\r\n So, we're actually here for a meeting,\r\n
  and I decided to pester them as they're getting ready.\r\n So, but Jim, you also
  help out with another group\r\n on the subgroups.\r\n Is that been kind of like
  a challenge?\r\n - Right.\r\n - Balancing the two groups,\r\n or is there any cross-pollination
  topics?\r\n - Right, so today's speaker was McHenry a couple months ago.\r\n And
  I asked him to come here, and he was happy to do it.\r\n So, there's been a little
  bit of that.\r\n Difficulty, not really.\r\n I mean, we're pulling speakers for
  both, for both groups.\r\n So, there hasn't really been any competition\r\n or anything
  like that.\r\n - No competition at all?\r\n - Not at all.\r\n Yeah, I don't know.\r\n
  It's, you know, I've learned a lot\r\n doing the McHenry group with you.\r\n So,
  that's helped a lot with being able\r\n to shirk responsibility and give it to Steve.\r\n
  So, he can take care of this group, too.\r\n - That's cool.\r\n And, so, it's 8th
  Light, and do you have anybody\r\n that's, you know, that you're looking at bringing
  in,\r\n or have you, is this something that's holding on\r\n by 8th Light, or is
  this still a community\r\n just so happen to be?\r\n - It's still, I mean, it's
  just a community.\r\n It's not, we happen to have the meetings here.\r\n We want
  to have it in the same location,\r\n which I think is important.\r\n But, I mean,
  we like community involvement.\r\n I love having speakers from outside 8th Light.\r\n
  I want some help.\r\n I'm more than happy to take help from other people.\r\n -
  Okay.\r\n - We accept food and drink sponsors.\r\n - Oh, okay.\r\n So, 8th Light
  is not the only sponsor.\r\n Okay, great.\r\n All right, well, thank you very much
  for talking with me.\r\n I'll give you the 8th Light thing and shake your hands.\r\n
  All right, thank you very much."

  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here again at GoToConf
   2014, and I'm sitting here with Michael Nygaard, who gave a
   talk on DevOps at 5, where are we now?
   Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
   Can you tell me a little bit about DevOps at 5? What does
   that mean, and how did you come to that presentation?
   Sure, I'd be happy to. So DevOps was actually coined by one
   individual. We know when the name was created. It was
   created by Patrick Dubois in 2009.
   Okay.
   So that was five years ago, and five years is an
   interesting time span. First of all, it's a round number,
   and humans like round numbers.
   But it's also sort of the time it takes any idea to go from
   radical to kind of entering the mainstream. It's about half
   the time it takes for an idea
   to become completely mainstream, and it's about one quarter
   of a normal career for a working programmer, or what you
   would call the time from entering the field to being a gri
  zzled great beard type.
   Yeah.
   So five years was an interesting time to sort of take stock
  , collect up many of the ideas that people have created,
   sort of provide a survey for folks who haven't been in it
   for that time, but maybe are hearing the term.

   Right. In an earlier interview, we talked with somebody who
   talked about how they were using continuous delivery,
   working with the restaurant industry and able to deliver a
   change 10 hours before opening of a major bar.
   And that these concepts can be applied into serious product
   development that actually really touches an end user.
   And what might have previously been considered a, oh my God
  , we're in a freeze mode.
   Don't touch.
   Anything.
   Yeah, definitely.
   When you look at the reason for freezes and the sort of
   traditional deployment process, a lot of it is around risk
   management.
   The idea of saying an event, a negative event has a high
   cost.
   And so we need to avoid that cost.
   Right.
   I would turn that around these days and say, preventing
   that event also has a cost.
   It's not as visible in the immediate sense, but it's a cost
   that you feel.
   It's a cost that you feel in the form of friction and delay
   in getting things done.
   Right.
   And so we've changed to a different style of risk
   management that says, I'm going to try and reduce the
   chance of a bug slipping through to production.
   But I'm also going to make sure that I detect it
   immediately and can push a new release that eliminates the
   bug immediately.
   And so in some sense, the number of opportunities for error
   goes way up, but the cost of any individual error goes way
   down.
   Because you're limiting the scope.
   So is it trying to turn what was previously known as a risk
   period, like once we get into a certain period before it
   goes live, we have code freeze, to change is now not a risk
  , it's just part of the way we approach the process?
   Well, I'm a little cautious about that because there still
   is some risk associated with it.
   And if you don't adopt any of the other practices and you
   just go to fast deployments,
   you're going to incur some damage.
   Okay.
   As you speed up the deployments, you also need to speed up
   your monitoring and your metrics.
   You need to make sure that you can detect a problem very
   quickly.
   So focus on that mean time to detection.
   I've been in many places where the mean time to detection
   is measured in weeks.
   It needs to be seconds to really say you're doing the
   DevOps continuous delivery approach.
   And likewise, you need to be able to repair.
   The damage very quickly, Adrian talked about detecting a
   bad deployment within five seconds of when it goes live and
   automatically switching back over to the old system that's
   still live and running.
   So in that case, you say a 10 second error, how many users
   are going to hit that 10 second error?
   Right.
   So again, I'm trying to put it in into dollar cost terms
   where I'm comparing the expected losses from bugs,
   slipping through to production versus the expected losses
   of bugs that are already in production that you can't fix
   because you're in a freeze.
   Yeah.
   So to me, it almost sounds like you're trying to say we're
   going to reduce that surface area of that first group that
   hits a new change.
   And then once we know, because we've kept that surface area
   small, we can grow it out and then be able to retract much
   more quickly.
   Absolutely.
   And I think of limiting it in space and time.
   So limiting the exposure in space is how broadly is my
   audience exposed to the new code right away?
   So we use techniques like feature flags and differential
   routing to let a few people in at a time.
   And then limiting the scope in time is how quickly can I
   fix the bug when it gets through?
   Right.
   So, yeah.
   So the speed of or even being able to turn it off.
   So like we need to use a feature flag is, oh, that one didn
  't work.
   So that could be that instantaneous mitigation of risk.
   So the term DevOps, though, it's still been kind of a high
   level term.
   And we've talked a little bit about monitoring and
   continuous delivery.
   When you say the term DevOps, can you kind of break that
   down into kind of pieces a little bit more?
   Yeah, I'll try.
   Actually, the schema that I would use comes from John Will
  is, who talked about DevOps as culture, automation,
   measurement, and sharing.
   Okay.
   And culture comes first for a good reason.
   So the idea with culture is that we want to create a high
   trust culture where we have strong and deep collaboration
   between development and operations.
   This is why, by the way, I consider it a fallacy to hire a
   new DevOps team that sits between dev and ops and is
   supposed to be a bridge.
   Because instead of creating a...
   a tight junction, what you've really done is now made two
   handoffs instead of just one.
   Yeah, and they're alien, and now there's friction.
   Yeah, absolutely.
   And both sides feel threatened by this new team.
   So the culture is one of enablement and mutual support.
   So where previously operations was frequently held
   accountable for code they didn't write and the availability
   and performance of said code, now we would close that gap.
   We would close that feedback loop and say operations is
   going to enable development to move things into production
   as rapidly as possible and also give development the tools
   to see the effects of what they do.
   Right.
   And now the responsibility is on development to use that
   ability wisely.
   Right.
   So instead of focusing on process and automation for self-
  protection, you're focusing on automation to enable your
   partners and collaborators in doing this.
   So that's kind of the culture that we want to create.
   All of the tools, all of the monitoring is in support of
   that culture.
   And, you know, in what I'm thinking about when you're
   talking about the information and not looking at those
   metrics is how do you kind of protect yourself, but we
   should say mitigate risk, but or find blame, I should say.
   That's what I was trying to look for is I think about if I
  'm...
   If I'm running an app and I launch it on my local machine,
   I'm watching my CPU and my RAM, I just want to know how it
  's doing.
   And that's a normal thing that I do when I'm writing code
   locally, but that we should also maybe look at our entire
   systems at that same level of detachment from what it's
   saying, that it's not something that we're looking to
   protect ourselves from blame or faults, but just...
   How is this system working?
   Yeah, in fact, I would go even farther and say, when I'm
   putting code into production, I'm not just interested in
   how it's doing on RAM and CPU.
   I'm also looking at the effect on the users.
   What's the response time distribution?
   What have I done as far as average latency and the 99th
   percentile latency?
   What have I done in terms of conversion rates and revenue
   coming into my business?
   You know, these are things that developers...
   can care about and want to improve.
   Right.
   There's a much older idea that says, you know, developers
   don't care about the business.
   They don't understand money.
   They don't...
   You know, as long as they get to play with their code, they
   don't care what happens to the business.
   I found that to be a foolish stereotype.
   And so now you'll have developers who will optimize a chunk
   of code in order to improve the response time and get the
   conversion rate up.
   Right.
   So we need to think more.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right. Liggettion. G, that's a good thing.
   Right. Right. Right.
   Right. Right. Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right.
   Right. Right.
   Right. Right.
   Right.

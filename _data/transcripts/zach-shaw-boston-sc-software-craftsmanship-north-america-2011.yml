  group.\r\n Welcome, Zach. Can you tell us a little bit about the Boston Software
  Craftsmanship group?\r\n Sure. We have been around for about a year and a half.\r\n
  You were here before the last SCNA, right?\r\n Yeah. So the group, I think we started
  April a year and a half ago, whatever that is.\r\n And we do monthly meetings, usually
  like the first Monday of the month.\r\n And the meetings, we try and make them practice-based
  or discussion-based, so like interactive.\r\n Okay, so like doing katas and pairing
  exercises and things like that?\r\n Yeah, pairing exercises or discussions, like
  we'll read a paper and discuss the paper.\r\n What kind of, like the KADS laws?
  I'm drawing a blank now. The KADS paper?\r\n Yeah.\r\n Is there a paper on relational
  design or something like that?\r\n I'm trying to think. We read, last month we read
  the S-unit paper that Kent Beck wrote.\r\n Okay, Kent Beck, yeah.\r\n And then other
  things we've read, I'm drawing a blank right now.\r\n But you kind of have homework
  a little bit between these?\r\n Yeah, sometimes we try and have a little bit of
  homework so that people kind of come ready to discuss something.\r\n And that's
  definitely a pattern.\r\n I just had to wonder if that would ever be, you know,
  it might be nice for me if I came to a meeting and I know I'm going to be at the
  next meeting that I put in that time to read the paper so that way I can be prepared
  for the meeting.\r\n But if I come in and I just am coming into my first ever meeting
  and I've never read this paper, have you ever experienced anybody that's, like what
  has been the reaction to that?\r\n Have you had new people come in and participate?\r\n
  Yeah, so I think sometimes we attract people depending on the paper we are reading.\r\n
  So I know like the last meeting we had a guy who was lurking on the mailing list
  for a long time and he saw we were reading that S-unit paper and he was really interested
  in it so he wanted to talk about it with other people.\r\n Sometimes, you know,
  not everyone's prepared. I'm not always prepared. I'm pretty lazy about reading.\r\n
  But it's okay.\r\n Nobody's grading yet?\r\n No one's grading us, you know, it's
  just that, you know, as long as there's enough people who can kind of help it out.\r\n
  Kind of help a discussion go along.\r\n Okay, okay. And, go ahead.\r\n So depending
  on kind of what homework we had, it'll like usually inform what activity we do.\r\n
  Okay.\r\n So like one time I had everyone just kind of peek at, I think, Luau.\r\n
  Lua?\r\n Lua, Lua.\r\n The scripting language.\r\n The scripting language. And then
  we all just kind of like played with the language for, you know, coming in.\r\n
  Okay.\r\n And then I was like, let's see what we can do.\r\n Yeah, so.\r\n Let's
  make this thing bark.\r\n Yeah, exactly.\r\n I don't know.\r\n Yeah, we've had a
  couple things like that where we're just kind of like, you know, messing around
  with something that no one knows.\r\n Or, you know, we do like, there's a pair programming
  game that I kind of invented and we have fun with that.\r\n You invented a game?
  What is that? What are the rules?\r\n The rules are, we take some kata.\r\n Some
  simple exercise or something more complicated.\r\n And everyone pairs up.\r\n And
  you code for 15 minutes.\r\n And then one person stays at the computer.\r\n And
  another person leaves.\r\n So you get a new pair.\r\n And then, so you only pair
  on the code base twice.\r\n Okay.\r\n So you kind of like inherit a new code base.\r\n
  Okay, so you're like the navigator and there's the pilot who's got the keyboard
  and you're working with him.\r\n And then you get promoted to the driver's seat.\r\n
  Yeah.\r\n And then the driver goes off.\r\n Yeah.\r\n Okay.\r\n It's kind of silly,
  but it's fun.\r\n Like sometimes you're pairing on like a language not that you
  know, but it's okay because you're only on it for 15 minutes.\r\n Right.\r\n But
  also you're kind of keeping people moving through it and you're not just waiting
  for people to raise their hands and presuming.\r\n You're like, nope, you're next.\r\n
  Well, I mean, everyone's paired and then we just have a timer.\r\n So every 15 minutes
  we shuffle everybody.\r\n So it's not just one station where everybody's watching.\r\n
  Oh, no.\r\n Everyone.\r\n Oh, it's just everybody.\r\n Yeah.\r\n We have four people.\r\n
  We have four stations.\r\n Musical chairs.\r\n It's musical chairs.\r\n Exactly.\r\n
  Musical chairs with a cord.\r\n Yeah.\r\n Ah, there we go.\r\n All right.\r\n New
  name.\r\n Music's done.\r\n Everybody get up.\r\n Change seats.\r\n So, yeah, it's
  silly.\r\n It's fun.\r\n Yeah.\r\n And as we had a previous conversation, Boston
  has like one or two universities.\r\n Have you gotten any students coming into meetings?\r\n
  No?\r\n No.\r\n No?\r\n It's...\r\n Do you think it's just maybe they are not aware
  of them?\r\n Or is it...\r\n I think...\r\n Because it has to be a unique environment
  where there's mostly some very corporate surroundings.\r\n I don't know.\r\n I don't
  do the best job of publicizing.\r\n Oh, I'll edit that one out.\r\n No, it's great.\r\n
  It's great.\r\n It's hard.\r\n It's hard to publicize.\r\n It's hard to publicize.\r\n
  And running a user group, it's hard.\r\n It's a lot of work.\r\n And so that's one
  of the challenges, I think, of running a user group is doing the publicity.\r\n
  Yeah.\r\n And it depends how big you are.\r\n Yeah.\r\n It depends how big you are.\r\n
  Right.\r\n It depends how big you are.\r\n Yeah.\r\n It depends how big you are.\r\n
  Yeah.\r\n Yeah.\r\n Yeah.\r\n Yeah.\r\n It depends how big you are.\r\n So like
  right now we have, you know, I don't know, six to eight people who come each meeting.\r\n
  Yeah.\r\n It's a regular crew.\r\n But...\r\n I think you made a good point, though,
  about how big you want them to get.\r\n The user group isn't always about just trying
  to build the largest base of attendance.\r\n Yeah.\r\n It's can I build a group
  that I can meet with on a regular basis that I enjoy interacting\r\n and learning
  with.\r\n It doesn't always have to be I have 50 people.\r\n Or I have 80 people.\r\n
  Or I have 10 people.\r\n It's are we having fun?\r\n Can we do this for a long period
  of time?\r\n And are we learning things?\r\n Yeah.\r\n I think that's an interesting,
  you know, perspective on that.\r\n Yeah.\r\n And for me, that's what the Sosserer
  Craftsmanship Group is about, is kind of my education and,\r\n you know, my other
  peers' education.\r\n And so, you know, I want to make sure that it's...\r\n I don't
  learn best passively.\r\n I don't think most of us do.\r\n So it's important to
  me that whatever activities we do are kind of interactive.\r\n Right.\r\n So, you
  know, a discussion or an exercise or something.\r\n Okay.\r\n Well, thank you very
  much for staying with me.\r\n All right.\r\n Great."

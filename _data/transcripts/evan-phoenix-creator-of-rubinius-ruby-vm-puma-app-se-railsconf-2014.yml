  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm standing here with Evan
   Phoenix, who is a director with the
   Ruby Central and he's an organizer with the RubyConf and
   the RailsConf that we're at today.
   You might also know a little bit of his work inside of the
   Ruby community. He's one of the few
   people that can say they've actually created a Ruby. He
   created the Rubinius virtual machine
   and the Puma web server and probably countless other things
   I can't even think of, but those are
   pretty big things. But let's start with the conference that
   we're at today. Well, first,
   thank you for taking the time to speak. Sure, my pleasure.
   So, RailsConf, how did you get
   involved in organizing? Sure, yeah. So, I'm a director of
   Ruby Central now and I got involved
   basically being asked to do it by the previous directors,
   who were Chad Fowler, Rich Kelmer,
   and David Black. So, they asked me if I'd be interested in
   being a director. They had done
   it since the beginning. So, since, I want to say 2004. And
   they had decided like, well, you know,
   it'd be nice to have some new people come in. And so, yeah.
   So, I said, oh, it'd be great. I was
   actually working on helping them out with RubyJung stuff at
   the time. And so, they said, okay, well,
   you obviously care about this stuff. Do you want to be more
   involved? And I said, sure. So, yeah. So,
   that kind of brought me in, made me a director. And then,
   quickly, I realized that, oh, okay,
   we run these conferences now, too. So, yeah. So, that's
   kind of how I got involved. I was sort of
   recruited in, if you will. Yeah. So, I mean, you obviously,
   to have that level of trust, you were
   already very active in the community at that point. Pretty
   active, yeah. Yeah. Were you mostly working
   at conferences? It was mostly an open source. Okay. You
   know, I had certainly been to a lot of
   conferences. I'd been to plenty of RubyConf's and RailsConf
  's and regional conferences and
   international ones at that point. Not helping out a ton,
   mostly because I ended up speaking at a lot
   of the conferences. So, I didn't really want, I wouldn't
   have that be my focus. Not, you know,
   what I do now, which is running around and making sure that
   the conference is actually going well.
   Do you have coffee? Yeah, do you have coffee? Exactly. Is
   there enough coffee?
   I know the internet's down. Right. That's exactly right. Oh
  , let me look at it again. Yeah,
   okay. So, yeah. So, I hadn't really been involved in the
   actual volunteering and that kind of stuff,
   but I certainly helped out. So, you know, the Ruby
   conferences are, you know, very much a
   community affair. So, you know, I'd been at, you know,
   those guys are my friends and they'd been
   working on Ruby conferences. And so, occasionally, I would
   like, oh, what do you need help doing? And
   I would help out, just do whatever. So, I was fairly, I was
   aware of the logistics. You know,
   it wasn't a totally closed idea to me. I knew, okay, there
  's this and there's that and that kind
   of stuff. When you moved from being kind of in the code or
   just kind of helping maybe set up and
   things like that, how, and then being thrust into an
   organization. Right. Well, I mean, how much of
   a shock was that to your system? It wasn't too bad. I mean,
   I think that, you know, it would
   kind of, we did a little bit at a time. I think that the
   first big one, the first thing that we
   were like, okay, wow, was the 2011 RailsConf. It was the
   first one that O'Reilly was no longer
   a partner with Ruby Central on it. And we kind of like, you
   know, I wasn't really aware of the,
   I didn't, that was my first time doing that conference. And
   so, there was a lot of things
   that we were like, oh, my God, I'm going to do this. I'm
   going to do this. I'm going to do this.
   We have no signage. And it's two weeks before the
   conference. So, we were like, quick, do a bunch
   of signs. And we need a t-shirt real fast. Do a bunch of t-
  shirts, you know. So, that was a little,
   there's these times where it gets very hectic. And we've
   actually gotten a lot better with
   managing that kind of stuff now. But it wasn't a huge shock
  . You know, it's managing expectations
   is sort of what making a conference is all about. And
   honestly, having an open source project is
   a lot about managing other.
   Your users' expectations and that kind of thing. So, it's
   not totally dissimilar.
   Yeah. Has it changed your perspective of running and
   organizing? Has it really changed?
   If you go to other conferences, do you look at them a
   little differently?
   Oh, yeah. One thing that we, the organizers that we were
   talking about is whether or not we feel
   like the conference has gone well, right? That's a thing
   that we're constantly asking ourselves
   and asking each other, you know, are things going okay?
   That kind of stuff. And it's funny,
   we can't, our opinions.
   It's actually really bad on whether or not it's going well.
   Because we only see the warts.
   We only see the stuff that doesn't work. Because that's the
   stuff that gets brought to our attention.
   The stuff that does work really well, people are like, oh,
   that was great. They don't, we
   don't really hear about that kind of stuff. So, we actually
   have to like go ask people's
   opinions. How's the conference going? I think that, so now
   when I go to other conferences
   and I see what's going on, I'm much more attuned to like,
   okay, they're having a problem. I
   can tell the way that they're acting. Oh, there's a problem
   over here. And I don't know
   how to deal with it. But I can tell.
   Yeah.
   You feel a little bit of sympathy.
   Exactly.
   That's exactly right. Yeah.
   And the other thing is, like in a FOSS project, where you
  're working and you've got the people
   complaining. And those probably are the ones that are most
   in your face. I mean, you're
   working on a project that's very, very visible. And then
   every time somebody gets frustrated,
   they're like, I'm not.
   Yeah, yeah, yeah. This thing doesn't work at all.
   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
   So, you might feel a little bit more, you know, working in
   open source. You've maybe
   developed a little thicker skin.
   Oh, sure. I'm sure. Absolutely.
   Yeah. So, you're able to look at it a little bit more in
   context.
   Yeah. It doesn't really get, you know, when people say like
  , oh, this doesn't work or
   whatever. It doesn't get to me. I mean, like, I'm
   interested. I want to know, like, because
   I want them to be happy. And I want to know why it doesn't
   work. Like, what's the exact
   circumstances. But over time, I've allowed myself to not.
   For my emotional state to not be a reflection of those
   other people's emotional state. So,
   when they're mad, it doesn't make me mad. I just go like,
   okay, I understand that that's
   the problem. You know, we've got to help them fix it, but I
   don't get all riled up about
   it.
   Well, and like, even I chatted with DHH and Aaron Patterson
   about knowing that you have
   a project that people might be sticking their career, you
   know, not careers on.
   No, absolutely.
   Day-to-day job.
   Yeah.
   You know, how does that, because we've kind of segued here.
   That's fine.
   The, you know, knowing that you've created something that
   many people are, you know,
   paying their bills with and doing great work. And then,
   does that ever weigh on you? Or
   does it, or is that?
   It doesn't, I don't think, it doesn't really weigh on me. I
   think that more, it's exciting
   for me more than anything else that, you know, like we have
  , because I think that, I think
   that if, if people didn't set, weren't so adamant in
   telling us that they felt like,
   the conferences were going well, I think it would weigh on
   me a lot more. But I think that the fact that people feel,
   people come up and tell us that the conferences are going
   well, that there's all these great talks and that kind of
   thing. And I had somebody, somebody tell Marty, who's one
   of the directors say like, you need to pick not such great
   tracks and put them all together at the same time. Because
   I can't figure out which talks to go to.
   Yeah. That's like the good problem.
   Right. When we hear that, you know, that, that kind of
   means, you know, there's always going to be problems. But
   when we hear that from a lot of people, the way of knowing
   that, like, you know, we have a duty, if you will, is, it's
  , it's an energizing, it's a vigoring more than it's a
   burden. Because we know that, like, you know, we can help,
   we can help make the community better and keep it at a
   certain size and keep it going. And that will make, that
   will allow other companies to do more rails projects.
   And the people at our conferences will get those jobs. And,
   you know, so I think it's, it's more like we're happy that
   it's, that it's going as well as it is.
   It's, it's more like we're happy that it's, it's more like
   we're happy that it's going as well as it is.
   It's, it's more like we're happy that it's, it's more like
   we're happy that it's going as well as it is.
   We're all very, we're all friends. We all talk about what's
   going on because we all have different things to bring to
   the table.
   We're not building exactly the same thing. And so that
   allows us to, that allows us to sort of be friends, talk
   about solutions.
   How are you solving this other thing?
   And the other thing is that it's good that we're friends
   because it would be kind of lonely otherwise, right?
   There's not a lot of people doing that work. You really
   want to have somebody else to talk to.
   That's exactly right.
   Right. And so if, if we were, you know, if we, if we weren
  't friends, if everything was like a constant butting of
   heads, then it would be, yeah, it would be this very
   isolating thing.
   But because they're all sort of, uh, yeah, like I said, we
  're all friends. So that makes it better.
   So when people, is it, is it ever like, uh, you just want
   people to stop doing these comparisons or, or do you think
   that there is another valid, like, so that way people can
   weigh their situation?
   Yeah, I think if the people stop doing the comparisons.
   Yeah, I think if the people stop doing the comparisons,
   then there's probably not a option.
   That probably means there's only one thing, right?
   Um, and so that you want the comparisons because it means
   that people are looking at them and they're saying like, oh
  , okay, well, should I choose this one or should I choose
   this one?
   And what does this give me that that doesn't give me?
   What are the trade-offs?
   And I think that you're always going to have the comparison
  .
   You want the comparison.
   I mean, you know, there's a million different cars out
   there and that's all people do is compare cars.
   Which car should I get?
   That kind of thing.
   Right, right.
   And you want that.
   All the car companies want comparison.
   Comparisons because it means that they're looking at their
   other, you know, it means that there's sort of a healthy
   ecosystem of choice for these things.
   And that you can figure out how to compete on features.
   Absolutely.
   Yeah, and you want to compete on the things that matter for
   the users.
   You don't want to compete on, like, oh, or sabotage this
   other project.
   You want to, you know, your users say, okay, well, we
   really love something like this.
   And you say, like, okay, well, I'll go add that for you or
   whatever it might be.
   That's where you want to compete.
   You want to say, like, okay, we're giving people what they
   want.
   And that's, you know, who can give that the best or the
   version of it that, you know, some set of users want the
   most or whatever.
   So, you know, and again, because I, the conferences are
   fascinating, but the reason I'm so excited to talk about
   Rubinius is that we're here about Ruby.
   And that's, and it is Ruby.
   So, I also just want to also understand about how you.
   Your path to creating a VM.
   Sure.
   Not just the Ruby-specific one, but was that your first
   implementation of something like this?
   Well, okay.
   So, Rubinius is actually on its.
   It's currently two sort of virtual machines because it's
   got a JIT in addition to the normal virtual machine.
   But it's really the third code base for the same project.
   Okay.
   So, the first two.
   The first one.
   Okay.
   Well, I'll go back to the beginning.
   So, I got involved with doing it because I was always liked
  , like, languages and virtual machines.
   I thought that was a very interesting part in computing
   because it's like this building block.
   If you can make it really good, if you can make it really
   sound and interesting, then you can build anything on top
   of it, right?
   And so, I started off, I was just kind of interested in it.
   And a friend of mine, Ryan Davis, said, suggested that I
   get the.
   Small Talk Blue Book, which is this sort of canonical book
   that the second half of it is just a reference for how to
   build a Small Talk virtual machine.
   And it was a reference for a machine that they never built.
   Someone actually has translated it.
   Squeak was actually a translation of that thing originally.
   But it was just.
   It was more like a general spec.
   It was for documentation.
   It was like, okay, well, this is how you do this.
   And all the documentation.
   That's so funny to be like, it's a documentation of
   something that you're saying.
   And it doesn't exist.
   Yeah, they never used the code that's in there.
   In fact, there's all these typos.
   Oh, really?
   In the code itself.
   Which is fine.
   But it's all written in Small Talk as well.
   So, they didn't have Small Talk to write, to run this thing
   because they wrote it in Small Talk.
   So, of course, it was just for documentation.
   So, I got that.
   And I was like, okay, it's so easy.
   Like, I can read the thing.
   And I feel like, okay, this is what the bytecode looks like
  .
   This is how you dispatch the bytecode.
   This is how, when you call a method, what would you do?
   So, I really just translated.
   I just put the blue book into my own virtual machine.
   I wrote all in Ruby.
   So, it's the first version of Rubinius.
   And it's actually the first 50 commits or something in the
   Git repository.
   You can go back and look at it.
   It's an augmentation of the Small Talk, yeah.
   Well, it's for Ruby.
   But it was for Ruby.
   It's basically the techniques, the exact ideas that were in
   the Small Talk, but for Ruby.
   But it didn't run very much.
   I mean, it was like, it had its own.
   It did have a very simple garbage collector.
   It had a bytecode virtual machine.
   It was super, super slow.
   Obviously, I was writing it in Ruby and just running it on
   1.8.2, I think, was the Ruby at the time.
   So, I did that.
   And then I was just very interested in it.
   And then I got accepted to talk about it at RubyConf Denver
   2006.
   No.
   Yeah, 2006 or 2007.
   I can't remember.
   Anyway, so, and I realized that I couldn't present this
   thing that was just all Ruby and super, super slow.
   People were going to be like,
   Oh, this is very cool.
   How can I use it?
   And I'd be like,
   You can't use it at all.
   I suggest you never use this thing.
   That would be really kind of a bummer.
   So, I translated it into C.
   Just like hand translated it.
   Read the Ruby, wrote the C.
   Read the Ruby, wrote the C.
   And so, that was the first version of Rubinius that was,
   that you could sort of use.
   It was still pretty slow.
   And we kind of built up techniques and we did all kinds of
   stuff on top of it until about 2000 and...
   2008, 2009, and we translated into C++ and we changed a
   bunch of things when we did that.
   So, that's kind of...
   So, it's been, it was Ruby and Ruby and then Ruby and C and
   then Ruby and C++.
   Right.
   Okay.
   So, it's...
   So, what's next?
   A closure?
   I don't know.
   I don't know.
   Yeah, I have no idea.
   Yes.
   ADA.
   Yeah, I don't know.
   Oh, an APL version.
   That'd be fun.
   It's one long line.
   Yeah.
   Okay.
   So, you're...
   So, you know, very passionate about creating these
   concurrent, I mean, a multi-threaded VM.
   Yeah.
   And people always are looking at Ruby and say, well, it's
   got the GL, the Global Interpreter Lock.
   Yeah.
   And, you know, that you have to have the four processes.
   But look at JRuby and Rubinius.
   So, now you're, you know, you're actually in a way going
   head to head with Java.
   Yeah, absolutely.
   100%.
   Yeah.
   Absolutely.
   Which is, you know, that's...
   Scary.
   Yeah.
   Yeah.
   If you start crying, that's okay.
   I appreciate that.
   You know, because, I mean, it's a huge mega corporation.
   Yeah.
   But, so, you know, it's pretty obvious that you're
   passionate about creating performance
   tools that we can use to run Codon.
   In 2014, if I'm looking at Rubinius, can I look and say,
   yeah, I should maybe look at
   this and try to see what I can do with it.
   Maybe look at my production systems.
   Absolutely.
   I mean, I think that there are still places that it's
   slower than even MRI.
   There's a lot of Rails code that does things that kind of
   confuse the JIT compiler.
   Yeah.
   But we have users that use Rubinius for very specific
   workloads because they control enough
   of it that they can basically make it...
   Their Ruby code can run extremely fast inside Rubinius.
   We have, like, high-frequency traders or people who run
   workers with just, like, the background
   workers, a lot of times people run background workers with
   Rubinius that aren't running
   inside Rails, and they're doing something that's like, okay
  , well, I'm going to go off
   and do this big calculation, whatever I want to do.
   I do that in Rubinius, and it's super fast.
   And, again, they sort of, like, kind of get the best of
   both worlds in that way.
   And that's because it's funny you mention that because we
   can actually, it might come
   as a surprise, but we can actually run other stuff on Ruby,
   not just Rails.
   Right.
   Right.
   Exactly.
   That's exactly right.
   Yeah.
   But, yeah, no, you did say something, though, that I want
   to hook onto.
   I asked this question to DHH earlier about, you know,
   because he is openly critical of
   certain companies that, you know, just so happen to use
   Rails and make a lot of money
   with it.
   And then you mentioned the high-frequency traders, which
   are controversial.
   Sure, sure.
   You know, I don't know what your feelings are regarding
   high-frequency trading, but
   knowing that your tools are getting used to basically buy
   people's islands, but they're
   not necessarily...
   They're not necessarily giving anything back.
   Okay.
   You know, what are your thoughts regarding...
   Yeah.
   I mean, I think that, you know, going in when I was, when I
   started writing a VM, I thought
   about this, actually.
   I was like, okay, I'm going to write, if I really want to
   do this, and this is true for
   almost any job.
   This is not just true for a Ruby implementation.
   But some of you give away, and you don't...
   Yeah, absolutely.
   At least for a job, I've got a paycheck.
   Yeah, yes.
   It, I think that you, you go in and you're like, I'm going
   to do this.
   I'm going to do this.
   And you go into it saying that, like, you know, the, if my
   license is such a way that
   I want, I want people to use this independent of whether or
   not I agree with the way that
   they're using it, you have to kind of, like, sort of, you
   know...
   Divorce your...
   Yeah, kind of check that at the door.
   Right.
   You have to say, like, look, there's always going to be
   those people who are going to
   do something with it that you don't, that you would not do
   with it, right?
   That doesn't mean that your thing is not good and that you
   shouldn't not do that because,
   oh, someone might use it in a bad way.
   It's not a...
   It's not a nuclear weapon.
   It's not nuclear, you know, that kind of thing.
   It's just some software.
   If you don't do it, somebody else will do it.
   It's not like there's this vacuum of software out there.
   So, I think that I've kind of come to the conclusion that
   it doesn't, I can't, I have
   no control over that, right?
   I have no control over what, how people are going to use it
  , what they're going to use
   it for, whether or not I agree with what they use it for.
   And so, I can't really allow myself to worry about that.
   That's just, like, that's the world that's going to happen.
   So, that's how it goes.
   And just a funny anecdote is that I had a friend, I have a
   friend who was listening
   to a Senate judiciary hearing against some company, for a
   company he worked with, and
   they were having to explain their algorithm, and he's
   sitting there watching, and he's
   with his daughter, and he says, daddy wrote that.
   Wow, that's amazing.
   Yeah.
   And he's listening to these people talk about this anti-mon
  opoly, you know, I'm not going
   to say who or what.
   Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's amazing.
   Yeah, yeah, that's super interesting.
   And, but, you know, hearing about, you know, like I said, D
  HH complaining or commenting
   on certain companies, and you mentioned the high-frequency
   trading, it's like, this stuff
   can get used in ways that maybe aren't anticipated, but you
   kind of just have to let it go.
   I mean, I think for me, I think the way that I, the way
   that I come to terms with it is
   just to think that if, if I'm making, if I'm making money,
   I'm making money, I'm making
   my users happy, whatever they do with it, I sort of, that's
   fine with it, right?
   Again, I can't control that.
   I just, but I still want to, I still am beholden, I hold
   myself beholden to the users who work
   this thing.
   You know, so I'm going to use it too.
   I'm a user as well, but those people's opinions matter as
   well.
   So I want to, if they're happy with what's going on, then
   that, then I'm fine with it.
   And I have to just sort of end there.
   I can't get into the deeper, but what are they actually
   doing with it?
   I can't, I can't do that, so.
   Right.
   And, you know, just coming back to the conference, you know
  , 2014 is wrapping up, I mean, or
   not 2014 in general, but the RailsConf 2014 is wrapping up
   today.
   Are there already plans for what's next or, since you're in
   Chicago, you go all over?
   Yeah, so we've got RubyConf in November coming up, that's
   in San Diego.
   Okay.
   And then we have RailsConf 2015, which we're going to
   announce the location for at the
   keynote this afternoon.
   Great.
   And then, yeah, we're good.
   So it's live in wallets.
   Yeah.
   Oh, yeah.
   Yeah.
   We're, we're going.
   We're going.
   Everything's good.
   You know, I think that people have asked us, you know, like
  , oh, could the conference be
   bigger?
   Is the conference growing okay?
   And, you know, we sell out the, we sell out both
   conferences every year.
   You know, RailsConf only sells out a couple weeks before
   the conference actually starts.
   But that actually tells us that we're probably exactly the
   right size.
   Okay.
   Because if we weren't selling, if we weren't selling out,
   we'd know that we're probably
   buying, you know, we're a little too big.
   If we sold out too early, maybe we're a little too small.
   But we're kind of where we are.
   We're kind of in this sweet spot, I think.
   And, you know, we're a lot of people that are, you know, we
  're a lot of people that are
   a lot of new people at this year's RailsConf, which is
   super, super important.
   We know that the community is healthy.
   We know that there's new people coming in.
   You know, at some point, I've told this to other people, at
   some point there will be
   a decline.
   I don't know when that's going to occur.
   I don't know what it looks like.
   But I know that having new people come in, be it in the
   community, be it at the conferences,
   will delay that decline, you know, all the time.
   So it might come someday, but it's, well, eventually there
  's going to be the heat death
   of the universe.
   But not this year.
   But not this year.

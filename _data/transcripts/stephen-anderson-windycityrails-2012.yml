  Hi, I'm Mike. I'm at Windy City Rails again. I'm standing here with Steven Anderson who
   runs the Mad Railers and he's involved with the Madison Ruby up in Madison, Wisconsin.
   So thank you for taking a few minutes to talk with me. Can you tell me a little bit about
   what Mad Railers is and what you're doing up in Madison?
   Well Mad Railers, a friend and I started that in early 2006 right after we did the first
   agile web development with Rails book in a book club. And he went on to start teaching
   Rails at the Tech College and he and I launched the users group. And I inherited the user
   group from him a few years later. I'm still involved in running it.
   Many other people help run it as well. And it's really blossomed lately. We typically
   have about 20 people at a meeting and we have a wide range of things we do. The next couple
   will be focused, the next one will be introduction for newbies, kind of introduction to Rails.
   And the one after that we're going to split in two. We're going to do Coens and Katas.
   Okay, so more of a hands-on and then also more of a lecture?
   We've traditionally been kind of oriented towards having people talk on a subject. But
   I'm personally trying to move us towards more doing and I'm going to resurrect open hack
   days again. And other people in Mad Railers who want to host hack evenings are welcome
   to do the same. I like to do the days just because a full day lets you bite off Meteorite.
   Yeah, and when I talked to Jim Remsick yesterday, he kind of described that Madison has a very
   interesting culture. And has that something that, like with the Madison Ruby, tries to
   make sure that it really incorporates the local flavor of Madison into the conference.
   Is that something that's affected how you work with Mad Railers, that it has, Madison
   has its own unique culture?
   It certainly does. We don't talk about it much at Mad Railers.
   Because you're all in Madison, so the fish doesn't talk about the sea.
   Right, right. But as Jim and Jen are running a Madison Ruby conference, they're very focused
   on that and exposing technologists from around the nation and the world to aspects that are
   wonderful about Madison.
   And the Madisonites who participate in the conference love it as well. Because it opens
   our eyes to things that we hadn't been thinking about.
   Yeah, just something that's maybe kind of hidden in plain view. You see it all the time,
   but come in and everybody kind of has fresh eyes.
   The other thing that's really awesome about the conferences that Jim runs is the way they
   bring in master crafts people in other crafts. People who are not Ruby on Rails are not, you
   know, not programmers or designers, but come and talk to us about their craft and their
   passion.
   Yeah.
   And it seems like the favorite talks are generally not about Ruby on Rails.
   Yeah, yeah, it's something that's a little bit unique.
   Yes.
   But kind of jumping back to the hands-on, you said you like to do them during the hands-on
   sessions. You like to do them during the day versus the night. How do you work that with
   people's schedules? I mean, most of the times we do user groups at night because that's when
   people are off work.
   Well, what I do is I just kind of say, "Hey, I've got the energy to spend a Saturday and
   to host an open hack day."
   Oh, so on a weekend day.
   I post it, and anyone and everyone who can make it is welcome to join.
   But it's not on a Wednesday. It's on a, generally, a weekend.
   It's generally on a weekend, and it's something above and beyond the regular meetings. And
   another idea that I want to do is, I want to have a workshop. I want to have a workshop
   where I can talk to people. I want to talk to people. I want to pitch to the user group.
   It's something we did at Bendyworks, our software company. We did an internal conference, and
   we're about to do our second. And there's a really great dynamic in having, you know,
   amongst friends, by and for friends. It's a very low-pressure introduction for speaking
   to many people.
   Yeah. Early Geek Fest was, yeah.
   And I want to pitch that to the group. I think that would be pretty wonderful, imagining
   along the lines of a bar camp.
   Yeah. Yeah, those are a lot of fun. Low pressure, safe environments. I mean, that's probably
   one of the best things, I think, about user groups is they generally provide, once you've
   kind of established a presence in the group, it's a little bit safer, and you don't feel
   that, like, coming to a conference and having to stand up in front of 100-plus strangers.
   A dozen or so people that you know seems to be much softer and can lead to bigger and
   better things.
   Mm-hmm.
   Yeah.
   So, just real quick, we kind of mentioned before when we were chatting about Bendyworks
   having kind of an interesting relationship with other, what might be other competitors.
   Oh, yeah.
   Yeah. So, you know, you showed me how your laptop has stickers from a half dozen companies
   that might otherwise be called competitors if you were maybe vying for the same market
   or --
   Well, it's part of the joy in what we do. We're participants in a community that's
   so, so friendly and so supportive. And we're experiencing, you know, a market with enough
   demand that, frankly, most of the time, our problems are along the lines of, "Who can
   I trust to refer a client I can't help right now to rather than, 'Oh, I have to, you know,
   scratch and claw to land the next gig?'"
   Right.
   That's a pretty wonderful spot to be in.
   And it's so much fun to talk to other people who are running shops like ours and swap
   stories.
   Yeah. And has that been something that, you know, that you're a consulting firm, that
   you're involved with the community, has that ever been something where you've -- have you
   ever hired somebody out of -- that you've met just through the user group?
   Oh, yeah. The -- well, Bendyworks itself sprung into existence as a side effect of, you know,
   supporting the user group, amongst other dynamics. But, yeah, I started helping the
   user group and doing things and talking about Ruby on Rails and teaching Ruby on Rails without
   ever thinking it would become a company.
   Oh, well, yeah, that's an interesting way to go about it.
   And also, it's been our main source of employees, that every -- you know, support the community.
   Right.
   Help people grow skills. And every -- you know, we've been doing this for a long time.
   We've been doing this for a long time, and we've been helping people grow skills. And
   every now and then, somebody really stands out that it excites us, that we want them
   to be part of our group.
   That's very interesting. So it's a very synergistic ecosystem that you build the group, you build
   a framework for people to be able to come in and safe and have fun and share and learn
   and grow, and then you're growing, and then you start your own company, and then you're
   able to help these people come up, you know, and they're all having a good time. So, you
   know, the worst case is they come out and they have a good time and they learn something
   new. The best case is, yeah, they come and they join Bendyworks.
   Yeah. But there's other outcomes, too. Like, I really enjoy helping somebody who might
   become a Bendyworker and see them join a different, interesting company. And Rails has really
   blossomed in Madison.
   Yeah.
   There are so many shops doing Rails now, where, when we started, it was kind of like,
   "What?"
   Yeah, yeah.
   "What's this thing you're talking about?"
   Yeah, it's, like, caught on a little bit more into the mainstream.
   Yes.
   Well, thank you very much, Stephen, for taking the time to speak.

  for Windy City\r\n Rails Conference, but we're going to be talking about Chicago
  Ruby right now.\r\n Ray, can you tell us a little bit about Chicago Ruby and what
  kind of meetings you have?\r\n Sure, oh, about Chicago Ruby?\r\n Well, Chicago Ruby
  is a user group.\r\n Our motto is when smart people challenge each other to grow,
  great things happen.\r\n So we get together and we share ideas.\r\n We have three
  events every month, three meetings each month.\r\n One downtown that ThoughtWorks
  sponsors every month.\r\n A second one, a hat night downtown that is typically sponsored
  by Enova Financial.\r\n And in the western suburbs in Elmhurst, the Forest Group
  gives us a space there where\r\n we meet on the third Saturday of every month.\r\n
  So we have three meetings every month.\r\n What kind of numbers do you usually see?\r\n
  What kind of audience do you usually bring to you?\r\n Like how many?\r\n Do you
  bring in designers, developers, more people working with Rails, more people working\r\n
  with other groups?\r\n Yeah, we've done surveys to determine who comes out to our
  meetings.\r\n We've got really four groups, developers, designers, entrepreneurs,
  and investors.\r\n Roughly 90% self-selected developers, 40% designers.\r\n You
  see there's some overlap if you draw a Venn diagram.\r\n Yeah.\r\n And then...\r\n
  So there's devs and designers.\r\n Yeah, devs and designers.\r\n And then entrepreneurs
  and investors together make up about 5% of the people who identify\r\n in one of
  those four groups.\r\n Now, that's really interesting that you have people coming
  out that identify themselves\r\n as entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n Now, do you
  mean like actual people that aren't doing Ruby devs that are coming out to meet\r\n
  Ruby devs at the group?\r\n Yeah, there are a handful of people.\r\n You know, at
  every meeting, we get a few people who come out and say, hey, I'm looking for\r\n
  devs or designers.\r\n I've got this idea, and I want to build a team to do this.\r\n
  So we get a few people coming out who want to meet some people to do that, but mostly\r\n
  because of the content of our meetings, the lion's share of the people at our meetings\r\n
  are developers or designers.\r\n Right.\r\n Because that's who we want to please.\r\n
  You know, when we say when smart people...\r\n That's your audience.\r\n That's
  our audience.\r\n That's our primary audience, yeah.\r\n And so the other people
  are there because they're attracted by the primary audience,\r\n as you say.\r\n
  Yeah, that's interesting.\r\n That's an interesting dynamic.\r\n Now, a typical
  meeting, is it usually a presentation format, or do you do hands-on labs, or is\r\n
  it a mix?\r\n It depends.\r\n It depends.\r\n Meetings are always, there's a presentation,
  followed by a Q&A, followed by a visit to\r\n a bar afterwards, where we engage
  in adult beverages and brainstorming.\r\n So that's what we do downtown.\r\n That's
  on the first Tuesday of every month.\r\n We max out at 100 on the RSVPs there.\r\n
  Holy cow.\r\n So we typically get about 50.\r\n Sometimes we'll get 70, 80 in there,
  depending on the topic.\r\n Have you ever had a meeting where, if you're maxed out
  100, have you ever exceeded that?\r\n Have you ever...\r\n Yeah.\r\n What we find
  is...\r\n We've gone beyond the 100 in RSVPs, but if it's a really nice day outside,
  you might\r\n get 120 RSVPs, but a bunch of people go to the beach.\r\n Because
  we're at the Aon building, which isn't too far from the lake.\r\n So some people
  on the way to the meeting, I imagine some people just hop on their bikes\r\n and
  go to the lake.\r\n Yeah, they're like, you never know.\r\n Yeah, yeah.\r\n But
  you know, it's cool.\r\n You know, we have to live balanced lives and all that stuff.\r\n
  So it's funny.\r\n But you know, we find that when we get 100...\r\n 100 RSVPs,
  typically we'll have about 70 or 80 at the meeting.\r\n Right.\r\n But our average
  at the downtown meetings is probably about 50.\r\n Our hat nights, well, just recently
  we had a hat night last week that did 50 plus.\r\n I don't know what the exact number
  was there, but I know it was more than 50.\r\n Out in these suburbs, we'll get anywhere
  from 5 to 20, somewhere in there.\r\n Because that's a Saturday morning.\r\n Right.\r\n
  Yeah, yeah.\r\n That's what I wanted to ask you about is your schedule.\r\n Because
  you have a unique...\r\n You're dynamic.\r\n You're not just doing one group.\r\n
  It's like a chain of groups.\r\n Yes.\r\n A system of groups that you have the hat
  nights.\r\n Yes.\r\n You have the downtown meetings.\r\n Yes.\r\n And you also have
  the Elmhurst meetings.\r\n Right, right.\r\n How do you coordinate those?\r\n Do
  you have a team of people that you work with?\r\n Oh, yes.\r\n We absolutely have
  a team.\r\n If you go to our GitHub repo at github.com slash chicagoruby, you'll
  see a repo within\r\n our repo, a directory within our repo called How Chicago Ruby
  Works.\r\n Oh, okay.\r\n And in there is...\r\n It's the organization of how we
  build it.\r\n All right.\r\n I'm going to definitely link to that.\r\n Yeah, yeah.\r\n
  So I would take a look at that.\r\n And that evolved over time.\r\n We actually
  started off in Elmhurst.\r\n We started off in Franklin Park.\r\n We were five guys
  meeting in a library in Franklin Park when I became the organizer.\r\n And when
  I became organizer, I said, I'm not going to do it by myself.\r\n I want other people
  to work with me.\r\n One of the other guys in that room was Matt Polito, whom you
  know.\r\n Yes.\r\n So Matt became an organizer then.\r\n Victor Hong, Will Chung.\r\n
  If you go to Chicago...\r\n At Ruby.org, we maintain a list of organizer and alums,
  people who've been part of the\r\n organizer team over time.\r\n Oh, wow.\r\n And
  so the way we managed the three groups is...\r\n Well, the half-night, for example.\r\n
  Ginny Hendry came up to me at one meeting and said, hey, Ray, we should do half-nights.\r\n
  And I said, yeah, Ginny, you should organize.\r\n So that's how Ginny became an
  organizer.\r\n Right.\r\n You know, part of our organization.\r\n So when people
  came to work with you, you gave them, like, some support and help to...\r\n Oh,
  yeah, yeah.\r\n All the support in the world.\r\n And we...\r\n Yeah, because they
  had great ideas.\r\n Ginny had a great idea.\r\n They had great ideas for doing
  half-nights.\r\n Dave Junta came to us one day and said, hey, we should do coding
  donors.\r\n I said, okay, Dave, you can run them.\r\n Dave Junta was an organizer
  of Chicago Ruby for a couple of years, and he brought a lot\r\n of good ideas to
  us, you know, and to Windy City Rails as well.\r\n Yeah.\r\n So, you know, having...\r\n
  You're kind of a veteran in the field of running user groups.\r\n If somebody is
  looking to start up a user group now, is there any kind of sage wisdom\r\n you might
  want to...\r\n Sage wisdom?\r\n Yeah.\r\n I thought some just random stuff off the
  top of my head.\r\n Sage wisdom, whatever.\r\n You know what has worked well for
  us?\r\n One of the first things that we did when I first became an organizer was...\r\n
  First thing I wanted to do is make sure we had consistency.\r\n Because we want
  people to know that they can put on their calendar a Chicago Ruby meeting\r\n a
  year in advance.\r\n They won't necessarily know the topic.\r\n We won't know the
  topic, but we'll know the date, the time, and the place.\r\n So with that consistency,
  everybody can plan around it.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want to
  get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n
  And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once
  you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that,
  then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want
  to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n
  And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once
  you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that,
  then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want
  to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n
  And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once
  you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that,
  then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want
  to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n
  And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once
  you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that,
  then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want
  to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n
  And then once you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once
  you have that, then you want to get good speed.\r\n And then once you have that,
  then you want to get good speed.\r\n Thank you very much, Ray.\r\n This is Ray from
  Chicago Ruby.\r\n Thank you very much.\r\n for talking with us. Thank you Mike,
  thank you for having me."

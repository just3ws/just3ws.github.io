  **Mike:** Hi, I'm Mike again with UGtastic. I'm at SCNA and sitting down with Gary Bernhardt, who created the "Destroy All Software" screencast series and just gave a talk here at SCNA. In previous interviews I've talked about Gary's style of presentation and how, when Gary gets up to talk, he's going to drop some knowledge on you. He has a unique way of presenting. I wanted to understand how you approach your presentations and speaking engagements, and what influences you.

  **Gary:** The way I actually create a talk is, I think, very unusual. I certainly don't outline and I don't write. Usually I stand up in my apartment, start pacing, and just start talking for about 30 to 45 minutes. I might stop and make single-word notes on slides, just making slides with a white background, black text, single words. After that I go through a very long refinement period. But just standing up and talking creates the backbone of it. The pieces get shuffled, but the core message is usually there. If I'm proposing a talk, I'll actually do that before the proposal, so by the time you get my proposal I already know I can deliver a full-length talk and be happy with the content. As far as how I come up with topics, I have much less insight into that process. I just sort of come up with them.

  **Mike:** I want to talk about X.

  **Gary:** Sometimes I do. I keep a running wiki page in my personal wiki. It's just ideas, and I'll see trends. That's where my talk last year at SCNA came from. This talk was a little more premeditated. I wanted to focus on this idea of boundaries and values—the boundary between opportunities. It's a very high-level overview of how my talks work.

  **Mike:** Because last year was expansion and contraction, and now this year is boundaries.

  **Gary:** That was another pair of topics, yes. Last year was actually a series of seven or eight dichotomies: expansion, contraction, capability, suitability, and several others I forgot.

  **Mike:** Yeah, I sort of remember one.

  **Gary:** Those were all related, and then I tried to make a talk out of them—found the ones that fit together best. I figured out how to turn that into a narrative by putting them in the right order and adding some historical context. But there's usually a core idea. The core of capability and suitability was three pairs of words. The core of boundaries was just boundaries and values: the relationship between the boundary between code and other code, and how that relates to a value passed between code and other code. There's always a core.

  **Mike:** The value is how you correspond words?

  **Gary:** Yes, the value being the boundary itself—the thing that goes between two pieces of code for them to communicate, as opposed to a blocking synchronous message send or a method call. There's usually a core idea that's very simple and can be expressed in just a few words.

  **Mike:** With your "Destroy All Software" series, is that a similar methodology that you use to come up with topics for that screencast?

  **Gary:** Sort of. It's a little different because "Destroy All Software" are screencasts. I can't just come up with things to say and then put images to them—that would be me doing a talk. I practice talks every other week, which I don't think would be worth $9 a month. Instead with a screencast, I usually sit down and just silently go through it. There will be a refactoring that's the core of a screencast, so I'll just do it silently a few times. If it still feels interesting after a couple times, I'll pull out the microphones, start recording, and just start doing it. Sometimes the second time I do it I'm already recording. I do it all the way through over and over again until I feel good enough about it—I didn't make any major mistakes, I didn't have to backtrack, I didn't stumble over words. It's similar in that I don't do upfront planning, I just start doing it, but the thing I'm doing is different. For a talk I'm standing up and speaking and the visual is secondary. For a screencast the visual is much more prominent and important. I start with the visual work and then figure out what to say.

  **Mike:** I have to ask, do you do the art for your presentations?

  **Gary:** The designs, the slide design, yep. I do all that myself. I'm not a good designer—at least I don't think I am—but I know how to get a color scheme on the internet. I know how to make things either line up or not line up in conspicuous ways. Those are sort of the core things.

  **Mike:** Maybe it's the simplicity and having a clean design.

  **Gary:** Preparing talks has been the mechanism by which I've become much better at design. The main thing I had to learn is that it's very simple. I have a lot of slides where there will be—like I did a lightning talk today about how I design slides—a slide might be four words. But I don't just put four words in the middle of the screen with black and white. The color choice matters. At least one of those words is probably a different color for some semantic reason. And they're not just in a line—they're in some kind of spatial relationship. It keeps people interested in the content.

  **Mike:** Where did that influence start?

  **Gary:** The point at which I started doing it was when I read a blog post by Zach Holman, who's at GitHub. I forget the name of the post, but one of the big things he said was: line things up or don't line things up. That is sort of the core of what I do. It's really simple. Big fonts, not a lot of stuff on a slide, line things up or don't line things up.

  **Mike:** With "Destroy All Software," I remember when you came to SCNA and you were talking about it. I think you were just at the point of launching, where you had just a few.

  **Gary:** That was last year summer, so I was a couple months in.

  **Mike:** You were open to suggestions and you did apply some of those. I thought that was very impressive—that it wasn't "I'm going to create this thing and I'm just going to push it out the way I see fit." You were open to feedback. A few years on, watching the interactions you have, I wonder: is that something that's been a double-edged sword with interacting with the community?

  **Gary:** As far as "Destroy All Software," I would say no. I get a fair bit of email to the support address, a few emails a day—not a huge amount, but enough that I have to check it regularly. I don't know that I've ever gotten a question I thought was just a dumb question. People are very deeply engaged and the questions they ask are usually deep, meaningful questions, like they've really understood what I was trying to say. That is not true in general on Twitter, where people may lack context about me. They might have followed me because they saw me do some silly four-minute lightning talk. The context for my relationship to software colors your perception of what a person either believes or is saying. So there are very different worlds. The "Destroy All Software" subscribers have a lot of context for what I think about programming and they very rarely misattribute ideas to me or misunderstand what I'm saying.

  **Mike:** But on Twitter, different story?

  **Gary:** On Twitter, different story. It's much more frustrating for me because people will explain very basic computer science concepts to me. I'm like, I know that already, I don't need that explained to me. It's very frustrating when 20 people explain to you what a basic data structure is. I feel sort of attacked. It feels like people are calling me stupid, even though I know that's not happening. The emotional response I get is defensive, like I'm being attacked.

  **Mike:** We were saying before we started the interview that Twitter is a very lossy medium. Even the written word in long form is hard to convey intent. I tried to couch a joke today and I was like, I don't know how this will be received. Some people are very literal and see a question and think, "Oh wow, I'm surprised he didn't know that." Is it something that, as you become more successful, success can be a double-edged sword? That's really what I was going for. With "Destroy All Software," you become more known. There's a kind of demi-fame in our profession, and you move from being one of the people in the crowd to being a focal point. People start to come to you, kind of like with Uncle Bob. It's not that it's him, it's what people's motivations are for going to that person—are they going because he's famous or because they've seen value in what he says?

  **Gary:** That's an interesting dichotomy. In the early days it's got to be the latter: people go because you said something they found useful. But when you become well known enough, people come to you because of your name, or they might dislike you and assume you're wrong because of your name. There are people who view anyone with notoriety as either extracting money from people by unfair means or being detached from reality. There are a lot of people who think some of the core Agile guys don't program, which isn't true—they all hack all the time. I've had a little bit of that. It's been very frustrating, and I'm planning on reducing my public visibility for exactly this reason. I don't want to turn into more of a curmudgeon than I am naturally because I feel beaten down.

  **Mike:** I wonder if that's what happened with _why. Overall most people were positive, but I wonder if there was enough negative that it drove him away.

  **Gary:** I know people in the Ruby community, prominent people, more than one of them, who think that's exactly what happened. If you go back to some of _why's posts and read the comments, the posts are self-contained. But in the comments, he's interacting with people in a very sarcastic, dry way. I think that might have been masking discontent behind his very dry speaking. I don't want to guess what was going on in his head. Poor guy probably just wants us to never say a thing again.

  **Mike:** It's relevant to this conversation though. You're talking to many people here—speakers, prolific speakers, authors, even free and open source folks. Sometimes people are just like, "Do this," as if you owe them something. It's the same for speakers and authors. There's a social contract, but some people take it too far.

  **Gary:** That relates back to "Destroy All Software" interactions versus public Twitter interactions. It's very rare for a subscriber to demand anything. There are a couple of things people seem to want, like an iTunes feed, which I will do someday. But as far as demanding that I do something for them, it's very rare. On public Twitter, people will tweet me a link to 100 lines of code including specs and ask, "What's wrong with this?" I can't read and deeply analyze 100 lines of code at a whim. It will take me half an hour, and I'm not going to take the time to do that. It puts you in the unfortunate position of telling someone no, and they may not realize the level of demand that's on you. As you can tell, I have lots of feelings bound up in this.

  **Mike:** A few years ago there was a popular ASP.NET site called "Four Guys from Rolla." One of the guys got so many questions he responded with a link to a page that explained how to hire him—"$75 an hour, minimum an hour." Maybe that's a way to turn these random questions into a few extra bucks.

  **Gary:** Yeah, there's always that. I don't think I've ever responded to one of these requests that way, partly because I don't want to seem like a jerk. There are many kinds of jerk, and I don't ever want to seem like the kind of jerk who's trying to take money from you.

  **Mike:** I was aware of his context when he did this. He was getting thousands of requests.

  **Gary:** If I were getting that many, I'd probably stop using Twitter and change my email address. The other thing is I don't want to spend my day answering the same questions I've answered before. I don't want to analyze code for the same mistakes I've found before. I want to be figuring out how to do new things that are genuinely interesting to me. It's not that those other things are bad; I just get bored very quickly and I don't want to be doing repetitive work. So unfortunately that's not a solution for me.

  **Mike:** Just curious, you said you ran a user group before—a Python group in Cleveland.

  **Gary:** I didn't start it, I just ran it for about a year.

  **Mike:** Have you done much speaking or engagement with user groups?

  **Gary:** Not really. I did a few talks there. The first talks I ever did were there, long before I ever did a conference talk. I have done a couple in Seattle, mostly short ones. I don't think I've ever done a full-length talk at a user group after I started speaking at conferences for the first time, which was 2008. So it kind of switched completely over.

  **Mike:** You alluded to having an opinion and I'm not sure how to couch the question. I'll just ask: what was your thought?

  **Gary:** My opinion about user groups is not why I stopped speaking at them. There are two pieces to this. One is that doing a talk like the one I did here is extremely expensive in time for me. It's probably now 20 to 30 hours of prep. When I started doing high-quality talks like this it was more like 40 to 60 hours. It's a lot of work, and I didn't want to do that to give it to an audience of 20 people. I mean, doing a talk at SCNA has a monetary value—it's how I make my living indirectly through "Destroy All Software." The other side is that I've been to a lot of user groups. I ran a user group for a year, and I think their isolated nature has some negative effects. You can get into a situation where the user group forms a thought bubble in and of itself, and certain ideas become prominent and are reinforced through people talking to each other and through presentations. I think this happened to a small extent in the Ruby community when the Cleveland Ruby community—of which I was an early and frequent member—got into certain ideas that, in retrospect, we weren't validating against the outside world. We just got excited about them internally.

  **Mike:** The insular bubble of not enough cross-pollination. Some of the conversations I've had over the last couple days have focused on getting beyond your small group. It sounds like the same problem: you don't want to become a hive mind where everybody just agrees and nods. Do you think the answer is spreading out and going to different groups—go to the Clojure group, go to the .NET group, go to something you've not done before?

  **Gary:** It could be. My knowledge is limited to my own experience, so I don't want to speculate too much. That could probably help, but there are always things specific to a group. In 2007 in Cleveland, you had the Ruby group, Python group, and then a bunch of more traditional Java and C# groups. There was very little counterpoint to Ruby because Python isn't a cultural counterpoint. It's a very different culture, but the things you talk about in Ruby have no analog in the Python community. There's no counterpoint to RSpec; the counterpoint is xUnit in Python. That may be better now—it depends on where you live—but I could certainly see it helping.

  **Mike:** Python has doc tests.

  **Gary:** Doc tests, yes.

  **Mike:** That's one of the things I think would be healthy—if a Ruby developer who's enamored with RSpec went to a Python group and learned about doc tests.

  **Gary:** That would be wonderful. Every Ruby programmer should learn about doc tests for sure.

  **Mike:** It's a different way of thinking. From the conversations I've had over the last several days, a lot of interviews have talked about cross-pollination. It fits with what you described about becoming too much of a closed group and not being exposed to new ideas—seeing, "Oh, that's really different than the way we do it."

  **Gary:** It's certainly valuable to do that at every opportunity—well, maybe not every opportunity. There's value to focusing down on something, but you need to come up for sure.

  **Mike:** Thank you very much for taking the time to stop in.

  **Gary:** No problem.

  Alt.net user group and I'm just going to ask him a few questions about his group.
  We'll start off with, well, what is Chicago Alt.net?\r\n So, it's very hard to define
  what Alt.net is. I'm not going to dare try to define it. It's something that people
  want to define when they're starting Alt.net. But I can give a few traits that could
  more or less describe the group.\r\n So, I think we are mostly developers that are
  going after the continuous improvement and improvement of self or processes.\r\n
  And also the quality of the software that you write. We like to think we are not
  necessarily .net developers, but we are developers that happen to use .net a lot,
  probably like .net a lot.\r\n And I think we try to also give a little bit of a
  voice to things that are good practices, good components, good methodologies that
  may or may not\r\n .\r\n come from Microsoft. It may or may not even be .net necessarily,
  so we try to give space for those things to be talked about.\r\n So, it isn't just
  about technologies that are related to Microsoft and .net, but things like testing
  and things like that?\r\n Okay, so, you know, that was Alt.net, but how do people
  find out about your user group?\r\n Do they have a site?\r\n Yeah, so, well, we
  do have our site. We have chicagoalt.net.\r\n Yeah, what's more like to that?\r\n
  We have an account on Twitter. We have a mailing list.\r\n In reality, this site
  and all the communications are mostly about our events and meetings.\r\n There's
  no propaganda of any type of thing there. It's really just about the group events.\r\n
  But you can find out by subscribing several ways. I mean, I think the site has everything
  you need to know to\r\n get info about the group.\r\n Well, so, you know, we can
  contact you via the site or via the Twitter. You said that there's a mailing list.\r\n
  I'm sure all that's linked through the site.\r\n It's all on the site. There's a
  calendar. There's everything there.\r\n Okay, and so, what is your, kind of, your
  meeting schedule? Do you hold regular meetings?\r\n It's a monthly, bi-weekly? How
  do you do it?\r\n Yeah, we have a monthly meeting. We almost always meet on the
  second Wednesday of the month.\r\n We meet on the Sears Towers, Willys Towers at
  Red Point Technologies.\r\n It's usually, well, I guess we start at 6:30 on those
  days, and it's once a month.\r\n Why do you go to 6:30? Why 6:30? Which is 6, 5
  o'clock, 8 o'clock?\r\n I think, you know, I don't really know why. It just has
  always been 6:30.\r\n I guess it's not too bad for people that work in the city,
  and it's viable for people that are catching the train from the suburbs.\r\n What
  typically do you see at a meeting? Like, what is, do you have, I mean, you've been
  doing this a while.\r\n How about over the last couple years, how many people have
  you typically seen? Do you see, like, a few people, or is it?\r\n I think an average
  meeting would have, like, 25 people. We have capacity of about 50, and we hit that
  several times, but normally it's really around\r\n 25. So it's a good-sized, I think,
  group for anyone that even has not necessarily given talks to other user groups,
  so I think I encourage our members to give talks, because they probably give talks
  to their, you know, development teams at work, and it's just a little bit of a next
  step to bring their talks to our user group.\r\n Okay, so, I mean, you try to not
  just bring in external speakers, but you're trying to cultivate speakers inside
  the group.\r\n I think, so, especially in .NET, .NET's a funny, .NET developers
  are a funny type of developers. I mean, they have grown up being told what tools
  to use, how to do things, mostly by Microsoft.\r\n There's not a, you know, it kind
  of comes with the territory. I mean, you work, .NET's a popular platform in businesses
  and enterprise, and it kind of comes with the kind of developers that you end up
  having in .NET, and so there are not a lot of .NET speakers.\r\n They're into non-Microsoft
  things. Some are, but they don't talk about it. There's no venues for them to talk
  about it, so one way to change that, we believe, is one of the charters of our group,
  is to create more speakers within the community, and so we really try to get our
  members to be encouraged to present on topics, and how often you're going to find
  a .NET user group that we invite you to talk about and hibernate, or go sharp.\r\n
  I don't want Ruby to be mine, but, you know.\r\n For a few years now, why do you
  do it? Why do you continue to work with it and maintain it?\r\n So, yeah, so we
  started this group in late 2007. We had a few formal meetings with myself, Derek
  Whitaker, JDM, and then we had more, you know, get together with more people. I
  think you might have attended some of those, and I think for me, it's the opportunity
  to participate\r\n in the process of changing the .NET developer type of definition
  or stereotype. You know, I think there's a lot of room for improvement in your average
  .NET developer. I don't like the terminology, but in reality, that's what it is,
  and I think that over the last four years, not because of my group, of course not,
  but I've seen so many changes in .NET.\r\n Visual Studio now shipped with jQuery,
  really, that's huge if you look back four years. So there are many things changing.
  Microsoft has an MVC platform. A bunch of those things changed over the last four
  years because of feedback and pressure from people. Some of those were associated
  with .NET back then, and I think that makes the .NET developer a better developer,
  you know, having access to things that are just normal in other platforms.\r\n So
  you enjoy being able to give developers who might not otherwise have an opportunity
  to voice their thoughts and ideas and what they're passionate about, a platform,
  to come and learn about other people's passions and to also share their own.\r\n
  Yeah, I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I
  think that's a really good point.\r\n You know, see how test-driven development
  is done, how behavior-driven development works. So many people don't know those
  things because it's just not part of the .NET culture. It varies by organization,
  of course. There's always good places that do the right things, but it's not the
  group. And I think that by having those people come and see ideas from other platforms,
  other groups of developers brought to .NET, and even .NET technologies as well,\r\n

  few words, then people start leaving after the presentation, because that's really
  what they're there for, is the presentation. So we kind of cut on the discussions
  after. We try to start food early, so people can mingle and network and talk about
  things, and just have a presentation at the end.\r\n I think that's what most people
  are interested in seeing. It's funny, because they are interested in seeing that,
  and they, for whatever reason, they like someone to be there to select topics, the
  participation.\r\n They like to curate it.\r\n Yes. The .NET meetings are very different
  from the Chicago Ruby meetings. I mean, it's not like people go in the mailing list
  and they offer talks, and they volunteer to do talks.\r\n Or discuss what the next
  topic will be. For whatever reason that I don't know, that just doesn't really work
  well. Maybe it's just we didn't figure out how to make it work yet.\r\n So I'm in
  that role of me and Eduardo, and trying to find the speakers and the topics that
  could be in line with the group's interest.\r\n And it has been working. We've been
  doing this for almost four years now.\r\n Okay, great. Well, again, this is Sergio
  Pereira with Chicago Alphanet.\r\n Thank you very much for being my first interview.\r\n
  No problem.\r\n Take care."

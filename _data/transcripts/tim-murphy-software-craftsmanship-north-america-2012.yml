  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic again.
   I'm sitting here at a SciTag meeting.
   What is SciTag?
   SciTag is the Chicago Information Technology Architects Group meeting, and I'm sitting
   here with Tim W. Murphy, @TWMurphy on Twitter, who runs the user group.
   Hi Tim, thanks for sitting down with me.
   Thank you.
   Can you tell me a little bit about what is SciTag?
   Well, Chicago Information Technology Architect Group, the whole long name that we're officially
   required to have there because "architect" is a protected name within professions in
   Illinois.
   Okay.
   We have to call it "information technology" otherwise we could sue.
   Oh, really?
   We started in 2008, four of us that wanted to get together and discuss architecture-related
   topics, but we didn't want to limit it to one particular topic.
   We had one particular practice within architecture.
   We essentially sit down with Microsoft people, Java people, Ruby, you name it.
   That's what I was going to ask, is it focused on platform?
   We're very agnostic as far as what platforms we cover.
   Now granted, the group that started the Architects Group was all Microsoft people.
   We had an architect, an architect, and a developer.
   I think that's what we did.
   I think that's what we did.
   We had an architect, an architect, an evangelist from Microsoft, Larry Clarkin, Carl Franklin
   from Maven Wave, and a gentleman from CBW, Steven Rylander.
   Carl and I are the only two that are left from the group at this point.
   Between shuffling our normal consulting jobs and trying to get speakers so that we can
   offer the Chicago community a view.
   A view into different technology topics that affect the way we architect solutions.
   So your talks are more like higher level, this is how we put together solutions, not
   so much implementation details.
   We vary.
   Some of them are very high level concept, and other ones, we've had a couple.
   One that we did last year was Java versus C#.
   So we went down into the code and more of an application architect level, and then we've
   had ones that were data architect or information architect driven.
   I've gone to one of your meetings before, but it was under a different name.

   Now when you kind of mentioned having to change a name, was that why?

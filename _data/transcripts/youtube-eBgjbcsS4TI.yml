  Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2014. I
  'm sitting here with Cindy Sprague,
   who helps with GOTO Conf. And help is a big word. She's been
   involved in helping to decide the
   location, the finally deciding on Chicago, and all that
   forward searching, scouting for locations,
   and then a lot of other stuff that's involved. And I just
   want to say thank you very much for
   taking the time to speak with me. Certainly. So what does
   helping mean? In the beginning,
   it was finding a venue that would actually take us because
   Chicago is very much a convention town.
   Right. So all the hotels are used to saying, well, if you
  're going to stay with us, you have
   to guarantee that every...
   Attendee will book a room and they want a huge financial
   guarantee right up front. That's not
   our model. Our model is to appeal to the local community.
   We do have people coming in from as
   far away as Poland. I met someone just yesterday. But
   mostly this is for the local community.
   So, you know, we're here in year two and we're back at the
   Drake Hotel.
   You know, when you were looking back...
   Now, let's see, over two years ago, three years ago now,
   and coming and talking to the hotels,
   what was finally brought you and what was some of the
   criteria you used to decide on
   going with the Drake in particular?
   Well, all the rest of the hotels said, you know, this is
   our model financially and put up or shut
   up. So we looked at a number of other venues trying to find
   some place that would fit because
   we like to have enough space. We like to have, you know,
   great catering as well as the ability to
   interact with speakers for all of the attendees. This hotel
   had a recent acquisition of a new sales
   manager came in and I approached her and said, so, you know
  , we spend a lot of money on catering
   because everybody wants to have a good time and they'll
   stay in and coffee and soda and all that,
   all that stuff. And they, the conversations in the hall are
   just as important.
   As the conversations in the, or the sessions, the providers
  , right? So they were actually willing
   to be flexible. They went to management and said, so let's
   look at something different and let's try
   this. So kind of the lesson I'm taking from that is if you
  're looking at a, at a location, don't
   just take that first one. You're going to have to go in
   there and dig. And I think I looked at
   20 hotels as well as a couple of public venues around the
   city. So, yeah, so that was probably
   a lot of footwork right there. Yes. Lots of
   emails, lots of phone calls. But to go to the other aspect
   of it, from, from the venue to the
   community, what about the Chicago community? And again, I'm
   a part of the Chicago community,
   so I want to hear nice things, but in all seriousness, you
  've probably had a lot of choices
   across the country. What was it about Chicago that, that
   made it a destination for Goju?
   Well, it actually came out of a conversation that happened
   when we were doing consulting and I was
   in a number of other people and we had a large project here
   in Chicago and one night over beer,
   it was, why is there no major software development
   conference in Chicago when there are all these
   great tech people and lots of technology companies, but
   there isn't a focused software
   development conference? And that was eight years ago. Okay.
   So, you know, it was a lot of talking.
   Thoughts that have come from a long time. From a long time.
   Yes. And Chicago seems to be,
   we have a nice technology base here. There's a diversity of
   technologies.
   It's a really fun place to come. It's an easy place to get
   to for speakers because of O'Hare
   being a central airport. Yeah. So yeah, we have O'Hare and
   Midway and the metro that comes from
   all over. I know that's what I take. For instance, you know
  , Michael Nygaard, he's one of our speakers
   this year. He's a great, great speaker, but he's up in
   Minnesota and he's like, it's great to be able
   to go to a conference where I only have to get on one
   airplane. Yeah, not too many transfers. It's
   pretty direct. Yeah. And it's actually only maybe a day's
   drive from, depending on where he is.
   Yeah. But so you were looking at Chicago as being kind of
   ripe for having a major conference.
   That's right. And working with the communities, one of the
   unique things that I got to experience
   is that you don't just come in and plant a flag and say, we
  're going to host a conference.
   You do some outreach and interaction work with user groups
   and other local communities. Can you
   describe how you came, actually also describe how you came
   to the idea of doing that kind of
   interaction? Well, this is a conference about software
   development, but it's also by software
   developers. That community is skeptical always about value
   and they want to know that there's
   value. So they don't believe, you know, a marketing person
   like me, they want to hear it from a
   developer. So it just seemed to be a natural outreach to
   reach out to those developer groups,
   like all the meetups that are in town. One of the problems
   of course, is that they are skeptical. So
   they don't always answer my emails. When I say we have a
   network of over a thousand speakers that
   we've vetted and we can pick from them and invite them and
   they'll come because we asked them to.
   Right. And we, so, you know, we like to pair to improve the
   offerings in the community.
   With the user groups and provide them with a tech talk
   evening.
   Right. So it's the go-to nights.
   Go-to nights. Exactly. So I, you know, I will send an email
   to, you know, all the organizers of a
   given meetup and say, Hey, you know, we'd love to pair with
   you. We'll bring you a speaker and we'll
   pay for it. And all we want to do is to be able to, you
   know, stick up our go-to banner. You know,
   it's all about the speaker as opposed to go-to. Yeah. There
  's definitely a value. Even if you did
   nothing with that as a user group. Right. But there's
   definitely a value. Even if you did nothing
   with that as a user group. Right. And all we want to do is
   to be able to, you know, stick up our go-to
   user group organizer. Even if I did nothing with go-to
   after that, it's, it's a great opportunity
   to just have somebody come in and bring in a fresh talk,
   fresh idea that might come from outside of
   the normal sphere of, of, of local talent. We try to bring
   you somebody who's not
   normally here. Right. Okay. And was that something that you
   did for the first time with go-to or is
   that, that does that idea come from previous experience?
   Like where did that idea to do this
   kind of outreach come from? Um, the one, the person I know
   that doesn't the most in the
   start of this was, was Dave Thomas. Right. Uh, when he
   started with Yao, who was the, the kind of the
   parent company for, for go-to, um, he was doing it in
   Australia and he's been doing that in Australia
   for nine years. Okay. And that worked well there. It works
   well there. Brought the, brought that
   concept here. So it seemed to be the natural way to evolve,
   uh, a conference here. So. So if I'm in
   a, uh, in a region that it's, it's looking at go-to and
   seeing success here in Chicago.
   And I think that I'm in, you know, let's say Minnesota, St.
   Paul, Minnesota, for example,
   just cause we talked about Minnesota and, and I'm thinking,
   you know, we could,
   we have a tech community that could support a go-to
   conference and make it financially viable.
   What are some of the things I need to think about? Um, when
   I want to reach out to you, like,
   what would you like to hear that, that would make it so
   that way it would be financially feasible
   to bring something like a go-to to your city? Well, if you
  're going to be in a place that's
   hard to get to by an airplane, you better actually, you
   better have a list of sponsors
   say that we're going to help support this. Right. And is it
   also, uh, being able to present like the,
   the, the actual community itself? I mean, do you look at
   all of those things? Okay. For one thing,
   we, we started talking to all the speakers we knew about,
   you know, we're thinking about doing a go-to
   in Chicago. What do you think? And they were all, oh,
   Chicago would be great. We'd love to come to
   Chicago. Right. Because part of it at least is that it's a
   great destination and it's also easy
   to get to. And speakers, the good speakers are busy and
   they travel a lot. So, you know, sending
   them someplace that takes 10 or 12 hours to get to. Yeah.
   So, so sometimes you're just, if you're
   too far remote, it's going to be, it's pretty, it's kind of
   hard because that's one thing that
   I think is, is missing in, in understanding why these
   conferences are so expensive.
   When I, you look at it and I, I know I've suffered the
   sticker shock many times myself
   at $1,200 for a two day conference. Oh my gosh. I can't,
   you know, like fork that out
   or my company won't fork that out. But there's a reason for
   that, that, that, that dollar, uh,
   that, that, that price, it's not, it's not, uh, just an
   arbitrary number. Like, uh, last year you
   were describing that it actually wasn't even profitable. It
   was not, we lost money last year.
   It was an investment. So, yeah. So, but, and then here you
   are, so yet again,
   so you still see enough value to keep. We see a future.
   Okay. Because, you know, um,
   one of the reasons that we have a long list of speakers is
   that we do treat them well. And so if
   we say we're going to take that money, we're going to take
   it. We're going to take it. We're going to
   take care of you. They're more like, they, they trust us to
  , to do that and come into a conference.
   Um, so that takes that relationship that we've had. Um, I'm
   sorry, I've lost my train.
   No, the relationship with the, with the speaker community.
   Yeah. So that they want to come out.
   That's right. And, and be part of the conference. Yeah.
   Cause that was an interesting aspect is that
   like, you don't have a speaker room. No, we don't. That you
  , you push the speakers out. Nope. You're gonna
   go talk to people. Yes. Well, that's one of the reasons to
   put out all the really good food. And
   you may have noticed it just kept going, right? There was a
   break in another break and then there
   was lunch and then there was another break. Right. So, uh,
   including mimosas to start the morning.
   Yeah. Yeah. I saw that. I knew I had a long day, so I didn
  't get to partake. They look delicious.
   Well, the whole point is to, to get people to stay out in
   the halls when they're not in a, in a,
   in a, listening to a presentation so that you do actually
   do get to walk out. Yeah. So that you do get to walk out at
   the end of the day.
   So that you do actually do get to walk up to Adrian Cockcro
  ft for instance, and say,
   and engage him in the conversation, right? Oh, it certainly
   made my job easier.
   So, all right. Well, I want to say thank you very much for
   taking the time to speak with me. Thank
   you very much. And thank you for letting me come and do
   these interviews as a, as GOTO Conf. They've
   been a lot of fun, two years in a row. Very good. Thanks.
   Thank you. User groups with lots to say,
   interviews and more. No way. Sharing great ideas in the
   tech community. Fascinating
   conversations, a plethora of information. Find out for

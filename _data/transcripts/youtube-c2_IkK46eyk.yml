  Hi, it's Mike with uTasic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2015. I'm
   sitting here with
   Alexandra Masterson who is the conference organizer today
   and thank you
   very much for taking the time to speak with me. Now
   conference manager, I said
   conference organizer, conference manager, what is the
   conference manager
   and how did you come into that position? So essentially the
   conference manager
   is someone who just makes sure that everything is running
   smoothly, makes
   sure sponsors are happy, that things like this are
   happening at the
   conference, that people outside of the space can interact
   and see what's
   going on. Also just to make sure attendees are happy as
   well. That's the most important thing.
   You're kind of like the MC, the party host, making sure
   everybody's got enough to drink, you need
   more coffee, just kind of making sure everybody's having a
   good time
   and has what they need. And you've actually helped me
   because I needed an iron for this earlier.
   So you've been very helpful and I also appreciate this room
   which none of you
   can see but it's very nice. It's beautiful. And it's quiet
   too. So, you know, GOTO Conf
   and how do you came to be the conference manager? You know,
   first off it
   was, did you come to GOTO Conf or did you happen to grow
   into a role with GoTo?
   Yeah, so I actually met my company Trifork while I was at
   my sister's
   conference, Scala Days Amsterdam in Berlin. Oh, so tech
   conferences are a family thing. Yeah, apparently.
   We kind of fell into that. And I met Trifork there and I
   had past experience
   with conferences and so we just kind of grew our
   relationship from there. And
   Nealey is our original conference manager, but she is on
   maternity leave. Yes,
   she is probably having a baby right now. She has had her
   baby. Oh, yeah, she has had her baby. It's a little boy.
   Congratulations, Nealey. And yes, that's wonderful. Yeah,
   last year we interviewed with Nealey and she's been a
   fantastic supporter of UGtastic, so best of luck and best
   health to her. So, but
   here at GOTO Conf, you know, looking at the ramp up to this
   year, there were some
   interesting events that took place and one of those was a
   meta meetup. Can you tell me a
   little bit about the ramp up or the road to GOTO Conf? Yeah,
   so we like to do, A, the
   Chicago tech community is really important to us and we're
   just essentially trying to build and
   strengthen that community feel. So we like to host events,
   bring speakers to certain user groups who
   are looking for speakers. We work with the Chicago Java
   user group a lot. We've worked with Vivek at
   Morningstar. And we also host a meta GoToNight, which is
   for meetup organizers, community leaders,
   tech influencers to kind of come together, brainstorm and
   trade ideas on
   what they want to see from the Chicago tech community. Yeah
  , and I've been
   involved in some of those, and they're really interesting
   because it's bringing
   the GoTo banner as a kind of a rallying point for groups
   that might not otherwise
   interact together. Yeah, so yeah, it's great. I mean, that
  's one of the unique things I see about GOTO Conf.
   Not only that you guys keep inviting me to come back and do
   interviews, but that you're
   really actually focused on not just, oh, this is a day of
   conference or a week of conference,
   but then there's this whole kind of buzz building and ramp
   up to the actual day of the event. Yeah,
   we want the community to make sure that we know that we're
   involved and we want to support you
   guys and make sure that we can help as much as we can to
   make it the best that it can be. So one
   last question. As a conference organizer, I always hear
   about the one thing they
   would like to have their attendees keep in mind that helps
   with things like
   costs and things like that. One thing I've heard in years
   past is water,
   another is the cost of coffee. So if you were to say, like,
   conference
   attendees, please do this one thing. Is there anything you
   can think of that you
   would say as advice? Maybe, I guess, just for our
   conferences in particular, one of
   the questions that we get the most is what is the Wi-Fi
   password? And all of our Wi-Fi passwords are
   actually cleverly located on the bottom of our badge on the
   front page. So if you are curious
   what your Wi-Fi password is, it's right there. It's also at
   the bottom. So just read your badge.
   This is a Bible of information. Yeah. And it's one of the
   interesting things about GoToComp in,
   in itself, is that you guys have this, all the information
   is right around the
   neck. Yeah. And I was commenting on that on a little
   preview video earlier that
   it's something I think all conferences should consider if
   they have the budget
   for it. Yeah, it's, these badges are amazing. They have our
   full schedule,
   speakers, sponsors, maps of the venue, and QR code readers
   so that sponsors and
   other attendees can scan each other and stay connected. Yep
  . So yeah, so there's,
   there's value that, you know, when we click on an ad on a
   web page, you know,
   we're helping support that web page, but when you come to a
   conference and you
   let the, the sponsors, the vendors, scan your badge, they
   know that they're
   getting value here at the conference, so they want to come
   back. Yeah. Okay, so remember
   your badge. It's got everything you need. It's your Swiss
   Army tool badge. Well, thank you very much, Alexandra.
   Thank you, Mike.
   I appreciate it, and I appreciate being here at GOTO Conf
   again.
   Thanks for coming.

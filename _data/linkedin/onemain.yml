  Owned architecture for the Acquisitions platform across customer flows,
  partner integrations, and legacy systems in a regulated environment. Senior
  IC accountable for architectural integrity, production stability, and
  cross-team execution, with authority built through incident leadership and
  system knowledge. Focused on making system behavior observable across teams
  to enable data-driven decisions, reduce systemic risk, and support reliable
  change in long-lived systems.

  • Final escalation point for high-severity incidents: led live diagnosis,
  coordinated investigations, aligned system understanding, and drove action
  plans with clear ownership.
  • Turned incidents into institutional learning by ensuring each major failure
  improved monitoring, clarified ownership, updated documentation, refined
  operations, and corrected cross-team touchpoints.
  • Reconstructed end-to-end acquisition flows by mapping execution from
  browser through application layers, middleware, and downstream systems,
  creating an operational model for incident response, risk review, and change
  planning.
  • Re-architected session state handling across multi-step workflows,
  eliminating a persistent integrity failure that harmed customer tracking,
  diagnosis, and recovery.
  • Founded and led the OpenTelemetry Working Group, set observability
  standards, trained engineering and cybersecurity teams, then transitioned
  ownership once adoption was self-sustaining.
  • Led platform modernization and lifecycle remediation under continuous load,
  maintained regulatory compliance, reduced operational risk, and restored safe
  evolution of legacy systems.
  • Re-architected fragmented ownership into one accountable model, clarifying
  responsibility and escalation paths based on production realities.
  • Founded an enablement function to isolate platform, risk, and remediation
  work from feature delivery, enabling sustained progress on long-horizon
  stability.

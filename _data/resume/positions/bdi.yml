description: >-
  Responsible for primary development and support for all BDI systems. I
  collaborated directly with the primary stakeholder on technical strategy and
  planning as well as managing teams on several consulting firms. I simplified
  on-boarding for contractors by creating virtual images that could be used by
  any developer reducing costly setup time. I also coordinated our internal
  communications and document management on SharePoint. I deployed a Subversion
  server to begin storing software and resources in a version control system.

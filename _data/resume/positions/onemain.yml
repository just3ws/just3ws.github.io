  OneMain Financial is one of the largest consumer installment lenders in the
  United States, serving millions of customers through ~1,400 branches and
  digital channels. The company specializes in personal loans for non-prime
  borrowers, operating in a heavily regulated financial services environment
  with strict compliance requirements. The Acquisitions platform owns the
  customer-facing loan application flow—a revenue-critical system processing
  high volumes of applications daily under strict availability, auditability,
  and data-integrity constraints.

scope:
  scale: Millions of customers, ~1,400 branches, revenue-critical loan acquisition
  ownership: End-to-end lane-level architecture, production health, and systemic risk
  influence: Cross-functional across engineering, product, cybersecurity, and executive leadership
  initiatives: Enterprise observability adoption, platform remediation, incident leadership, engineering communities

description: >-
  Owned lane-level architecture for the Acquisitions platform, spanning customer
  application flows, partner integrations, and a large legacy application estate
  in a regulated financial environment. Operated as a senior individual
  contributor accountable for architectural integrity, production stability,
  and cross-team execution, with authority established through incident
  leadership, deep system knowledge, and cross-team trust. Focused on making
  system behavior observable and understandable across teams to enable
  data-driven decisions, reduce systemic risk, and support reliable change in
  long-lived systems.

achievements:
  summary: >-
    Delivered durable reductions in systemic risk and incident recurrence by
    restoring architectural legibility in a complex, legacy-heavy environment.
    Served as the final escalation point for production incidents and embedded
    shared understanding, observability, and operational discipline as enduring
    organizational capabilities.

  highlights:
    - >-
      Acted as the final escalation point for high-severity production incidents,
      taking ownership of live diagnosis during large cross-functional calls,
      coordinating investigation across teams, establishing a shared
      understanding of system behavior, and driving concrete action plans with
      clear follow-up ownership.

    - >-
      Transformed incident response into institutional learning by ensuring
      every major failure resulted in improved monitoring, clarified ownership,
      updated documentation, refined operational processes, and corrected
      cross-team touchpoints across systems with decades of accumulated history.

    - >-
      Reconstructed end-to-end customer acquisition flows by mapping execution
      context from the customer’s browser through application layers,
      enterprise service middleware, and downstream business systems, creating
      an authoritative operational model to ground incident response, risk
      review, and change planning in observed reality.

    - >-
      Designed and delivered a re-architecture of session state handling across
      complex, multi-step user workflows, eliminating a persistent integrity
      failure mode that impaired customer tracking, diagnosis, and incident
      recovery under real production conditions.

    - >-
      Founded and led the OpenTelemetry Working Group, establishing shared
      observability standards and training engineering and cybersecurity teams
      to reason about system behavior using common telemetry; transitioned
      ownership once practices were institutionalized and adoption became
      self-sustaining.

    - >-
      Led platform modernization and lifecycle remediation under continuous
      production load, maintaining regulatory compliance while reducing
      operational risk and restoring the ability to safely evolve legacy
      systems.

    - >-
      Re-architected fragmented engineering ownership into a single accountable
      operating model, clarifying architectural responsibility and escalation
      paths as a necessary consequence of observed production realities.

    - >-
      Founded an enablement function to isolate cross-cutting platform, risk,
      and remediation work from feature delivery, enabling sustained progress
      on long-horizon stability initiatives without disrupting customer-facing
      teams.

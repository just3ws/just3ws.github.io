context: >-
  ActiveCampaign is a large-scale marketing automation and CRM platform serving
  a global customer base. The system included a mature PHP backend with a highly
  coupled core responsible for contact management, business rules, and data
  access, alongside a modernizing frontend stack.

scope:
  scale: Large, high-traffic CRM platform with complex legacy core
  ownership: Testability, performance, and change safety within core systems
  influence: Engineering teams responsible for backend and frontend reliability

description: >-
  Engaged as a short-term senior contributor to address deep structural
  complexity in the core backend systems. Focused on improving testability,
  performance, and change safety within a tightly coupled legacy PHP codebase,
  while making targeted frontend enhancements to stabilize and extend the
  existing test suite.

achievements:
  highlights:
    - >-
      Conducted a deep dive into the core backend subsystem responsible for
      contact management and business rules, identifying structural constraints
      that limited testability and safe iteration.
    - >-
      Introduced testable query patterns and caching strategies to replace
      ad-hoc global data access, improving performance and enabling more reliable
      automated testing.
    - >-
      Reduced risk in a highly coupled legacy codebase by isolating critical
      behaviors behind clearer boundaries, enabling incremental change without
      large-scale rewrites.
    - >-
      Learned Ember.js sufficiently to extend and harden the existing frontend
      test suite, improving reliability and confidence in UI-driven workflows.
    - >-
      Refactored shared pagination and interaction logic into reusable Ember
      constructs, reducing duplication and improving long-term maintainability.
    - >-
      Improved developer feedback loops by making previously opaque behavior
      observable through tests rather than runtime debugging.

context: >-
  ActiveCampaign is a large-scale marketing automation and CRM platform serving
  a global customer base. The system included a mature PHP backend with a highly
  coupled core responsible for contact management, business rules, and data
  access, alongside a modernizing frontend stack.

scope:
  scale: Large, high-traffic CRM platform with complex legacy core
  ownership: Testability, performance, and change safety within core systems
  influence: Engineering teams responsible for backend and frontend reliability

description: >-
  Engaged as a short-term senior contributor to address deep structural
  complexity in the core backend systems. Focused on improving testability,
  performance, and change safety within a tightly coupled legacy PHP codebase,
  while making targeted frontend enhancements to stabilize and extend the
  existing test suite.

achievements:
  highlights:
    - >-
      Diagnosed structural constraints in the core backend subsystem and
      established a path for safe iteration on contact management and business
      rules.
    - >-
      Introduced testable query patterns and caching strategies to replace
      ad-hoc global data access, improving performance and enabling more reliable
      automated testing.
    - >-
      Reduced risk in a highly coupled legacy codebase by isolating critical
      behaviors behind clearer boundaries, enabling incremental change without
      large-scale rewrites.
    - >-
      Extended and hardened the existing frontend test suite in Ember,
      improving reliability and confidence in UI-driven workflows.
    - >-
      Improved developer feedback loops by making previously opaque behavior
      observable through tests rather than runtime debugging.

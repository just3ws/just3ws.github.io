  As part of the ActiveCampaign Contacts team I have converted multiple PHP
  based endpoints to Ember.js. I implemented new features and performance
  improvements in the legacy PHP API backend.

  highlights:
    - Converted simple paginated PHP to infinite scrolling with drag and drop
      interface using Ember.js.
    - Refactored common pagination logic to generic reusable functionality via
      Ember.js Mixins.
    - Refactored performance in PHP API to use cached query and introduced
      testable Query pattern to replace global query functions.
    - Created scripts for developers to conditionally enable MySQL logging in
      their development environments.

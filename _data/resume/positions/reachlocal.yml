context: >-
  ReachLocal provided a large-scale digital marketing platform supporting
  thousands of small and mid-sized businesses. The system combined lead
  management, campaign execution, subscription billing, and reporting, and
  included a long-lived legacy codebase with significant data volume and
  historical complexity.

scope:
  scale: Thousands of customers, high-volume transactional and reporting data
  ownership: API design, legacy system modernization strategy, integration boundaries
  influence: Cross-team across engineering, product, and customer-facing functions

description: >-
  Contributed to platform modernization efforts during a period of organizational
  transition and acquisition. Designed and implemented new API layers to safely
  expose internal capabilities, while working with the Customer Funnel team to
  evaluate and de-risk a planned rewrite of a large legacy system. Identified
  fundamental data and system knowledge gaps that informed a shift toward
  incremental modernization rather than wholesale replacement.

achievements:
  highlights:
    - >-
      Designed and built an API Gateway to expose selected internal services
      through well-defined, secure interfaces, enabling controlled integration
      with internal and external consumers.
    - >-
      Evaluated the feasibility of a full rewrite of a legacy customer-facing
      system and demonstrated that unclear data lineage and billions of existing
      records made a big-bang migration impractical and high risk.
    - >-
      Proposed and validated an incremental modernization strategy in which a
      new API layer operated alongside the legacy system, allowing new features
      to be developed independently while legacy functionality was migrated
      selectively.
    - >-
      Designed a two-tier frontend architecture that separated user experience
      iteration from backend system constraints, reducing regression risk while
      enabling faster experimentation without destabilizing core systems.
    - >-
      Modernized critical integration points by wrapping legacy functionality in
      Rails APIs, extending the useful life of the existing platform while
      enabling gradual transition to newer components.
    - >-
      Reduced operational and maintenance risk by introducing code quality and
      security tooling, improving visibility into system health and failure modes.

    description: >-
      From Chicago Code Camp 2009 at Lake County Community College, May 2009. My topic
      was an introduction to Aspect-Oriented Programming using the Post# framework.
      This was my first public presentation, I think it's obvious especially in the
      beginning. The slides and additional information can be found here:

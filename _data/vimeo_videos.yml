  description: 'From Chicago Code Camp 2009 at Lake County Community College, May
    2009. My topic was an introduction to Aspect-Oriented Programming using the Post#
    framework. This was my first public presentation, I think it''s obvious especially
    in the beginning. The slides and additional information can be found here: http://just3ws.pbworks.com/Introduction-to-AOP-with-PostSharp'

    The unbelievably awesome Posterous experience encapsulated in four minutes of frustrated clicking.
    Basically, last night I was fighting with Posterous to make changes to a SCMC meeting announcement. I needed to add a sponsor image but wanted it to retain it's shape and be a clickable link. Posterous wants to load images into it's own format and will reduce them to a tiny, cropped square otherwise. But this session wouldn't even let me remove the image. I would edit, update and the content would be reset. I was working in Chromium and Firefox. Heck, when I open the dashboard in Firefox the post doesn't even appear until I force refresh.
    Don't watch it all the way to the end. The last 30 seconds or so was me trying to close Screeny but I have too many things in my status bar and it was hidden. :P

  description: C++ is still one of the most popular languages out there. Given that
    there are hundreds of languages, that still means that 80%+ of you have never
    seen it or needed to use it. C++ informs a lot of what we do in other languages.
    Come on out and learn about this thing called C++. We’ll teach you enough to read
    basic C++ code, understand the differences between a pointer and a reference,
    and maybe even show the dangers and benefits of this thing called multiple-inheritance.
    You’ll learn a lot—like why in C++ it’s cool when a friend touches your privates.

      From Chicago Code Camp 2009 at Lake County Community College, May 2009. My topic
      was an introduction to Aspect-Oriented Programming using the Post# framework.
      This was my first public presentation, I think it's obvious especially in the
      beginning. The slides and additional information can be found here:

      The unbelievably awesome Posterous experience encapsulated in four minutes of
      frustrated clicking.

      Basically, last night I was fighting with Posterous to make changes to a SCMC
      meeting announcement. I needed to add a sponsor image but wanted it to retain
      it's shape and be a clickable link. Posterous wants to load images into it's
      own format and will reduce them to a tiny, cropped square otherwise. But this
      session wouldn't even let me remove the image. I would edit, update and the
      content would be reset. I was working in Chromium and Firefox. Heck, when I
      open the dashboard in Firefox the post doesn't even appear until I force refresh.

      Don't watch it all the way to the end. The last 30 seconds or so was me trying
      to close Screeny but I have too many things in my status bar and it was hidden.
      :P

      and Cloud'
    description: As developers we all like to use tightly couple systems where possible
      and loosely coupled ones where necessary. In the closed world of the pre-Cloud
      era, traditional relational databases have gained tremendous leverage from tight
      coupling of B-tree storage, transaction managers, and query optimizers, providing
      developers with an efficient, consistent, and easy to use ACID programming model.
      In the open, distributed, asynchronous, and heterogeneous world of the Cloud,
      we must consider more loosely coupled computational models that are designed
      with distribution and concurrency in from the get go, and accept that our knowledge
      of the world is never fully consistent. Actors as envisioned by Carl Hewitt
      fit the bill perfectly. In this talk we will show how highly-available stateful
      Actors provide a flexible and easy to use programming model for the Cloud on
      the outside, while still allowing for the traditional programming models on
      the inside.

    description: The JVM has traditionally hosted many languages, but only those closest
      to Java itself got the full optimization treatment. Those days are changing
      rapidly with new JVM features like invokedynamic and lambda, and with the rise
      of new frameworks like Truffle and Nashorn. In this talk we'll explore what
      it takes to optimize more exotic languages like JavaScript and Ruby and see
      how the JVM is evolving to do a better job. We'll see how projects like JRuby
      and Nashorn are trying to work around gaps in the JVM's optimizer. We'll see
      how JRuby+Truffle routes around the JVM to achieve blistering fast performance.
      And we'll look at upcoming projects on the JVM that will make language-building
      even easier.

    description: Apache Spark has been blessed as the replacement for MapReduce in
      Hadoop environments. It also runs in other deployment modes. Spark provides
      better performance, better developer productivity, and it supports a wider range
      of application scenarios than MapReduce, including event stream processing,
      ad hoc queries, graphs, and iterative algorithms. Graphs are a natural way to
      represent many data sets, such as social media networks, and iterative algorithms
      are important for Machine Learning, such as model training with gradient descent.

      and human factors. Using these perspectives, we will look at how systems work,
      how you can optimize them, and the many ways they can fail.

    description: This session introduces org.ObjectLayout and StructuredArray, a new
      Java collection library and an array class designed specifically to enable JVMs
      to optimize memory layout for arrays of objects in a way that closely matches
      the performance behaviours of arrays of structs in C. org.ObjectLayout works
      on any JDK (version 6.0 and above), but when &ldquo;intrinsified&rdquo; in newer
      JDKs, it brings dead-reckoning and streaming speed to what is in essence an
      array of Java objects.

    description: Carbon Five has been using Agile XP from our very beginnings 14 years
      ago. Six years ago we started on a deep dive into Design Thinking inspired by
      collaborations with the Stanford d.school. We then extended those learnings,
      integrating Lean UX techniques, to help our clients focus the team's development
      power in a direction more closely aligned to a viable product market fit. Using
      two specific case studies and learnings from several other projects, I walk
      attendees through the weekly cadence that we use at Carbon Five during product
      development. This methodology and its activities establish a sustainable culture
      of integrated and invested teams that are able to communicate across disciplines
      in a meaningful way. The result of creating this type of culture via cadence
      allows our teams to put new features in front of users each week for validation
      and hence move the product closer to its market fit faster.

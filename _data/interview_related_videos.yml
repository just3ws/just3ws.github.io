      is evolving for new languages and features'
    description: The JVM has traditionally hosted many languages, but only those closest
      to Java itself got the full optimization treatment. Those days are changing
      rapidly with new JVM features like invokedynamic and lambda, and with the rise
      of new frameworks like Truffle and Nashorn. In this talk we'll explore what
      it takes to optimize more exotic languages like JavaScript and Ruby and see
      how the JVM is evolving to do a better job. We'll see how projects like JRuby
      and Nashorn are trying to work around gaps in the JVM's optimizer. We'll see
      how JRuby+Truffle routes around the JVM to achieve blistering fast performance.
      And we'll look at upcoming projects on the JVM that will make language-building
      even easier.

    description: Apache Spark has been blessed as the replacement for MapReduce in
      Hadoop environments. It also runs in other deployment modes. Spark provides
      better performance, better developer productivity, and it supports a wider range
      of application scenarios than MapReduce, including event stream processing,
      ad hoc queries, graphs, and iterative algorithms. Graphs are a natural way to
      represent many data sets, such as social media networks, and iterative algorithms
      are important for Machine Learning, such as model training with gradient descent.

    description: While micro-services are all the rage, they need to be approached
      with caution. Using the techniques of evolutionary architecture, coupled with
      continuous delivery, allows for the micro-services architecture and its companion
      data architecture to evolve. This talk explores the relationship between these
      three concepts, focusing on how they all support each other in the creation
      of complex systems.

      But despite this, despite big steps forward with TDD, BDD, and other approaches
      which bring automated testing to the forefront of the development process, many
      developers still behave as if testing is a second class citizen.

      to optimize memory layout for arrays of objects in a way that closely matches
      the performance behaviours of arrays of structs in C. org.ObjectLayout works
      on any JDK (version 6.0 and above), but when &ldquo;intrinsified&rdquo; in newer
      JDKs, it brings dead-reckoning and streaming speed to what is in essence an
      array of Java objects.

    description: 'Stateless applications aren''t: they rely on other systems storing
      and transforming shared state correctly. On the basis of documentation and reputation
      we assume that our clients and database systems comprise a safe, meaningful
      distributed system. How justified is our faith in that system''s correctness?
      Do popular databases actually provide the safety invariants we assume? Are we
      using those invariants correctly? I want experimental answers to these questions.'

    description: As developers we all like to use tightly couple systems where possible
      and loosely coupled ones where necessary. In the closed world of the pre-Cloud
      era, traditional relational databases have gained tremendous leverage from tight
      coupling of B-tree storage, transaction managers, and query optimizers, providing
      developers with an efficient, consistent, and easy to use ACID programming model.
      In the open, distributed, asynchronous, and heterogeneous world of the Cloud,
      we must consider more loosely coupled computational models that are designed
      with distribution and concurrency in from the get go, and accept that our knowledge
      of the world is never fully consistent. Actors as envisioned by Carl Hewitt
      fit the bill perfectly. In this talk we will show how highly-available stateful
      Actors provide a flexible and easy to use programming model for the Cloud on
      the outside, while still allowing for the traditional programming models on
      the inside.

    description: 'Dr. Anita Sengupta is an engineer at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory (JPL). She has been developing entry system and propulsion technologies
      for Mars, Venus, and deep space missions for the past decade. She is currently
      the Project Manager for the Cold Atom Laboratory Mission, an ultra-cold quantum
      gas experiment to be launched to the International Space Station in 2016. She
      previously was the lead systems engineer for the MSL supersonic parachute, leading
      the development of a Mars Ascent Vehicle, the principal investigator for the
      Orion Vehicle Drogue Parachute Subscale Test Program, entry system lead for
      a Venus lander mission, lead systems engineer for a Mars Sample return mission
      concept, and Co-Investigator of several plasma propulsion development programs
      including VHITAL, NEXIS, and Prometheus 1. Prior to joining JPL she worked in
      industry on the Delta IV Launch Vehicle, X37 Vehicle, Space Shuttle, and Commercial
      Communication Satellites (XM-radio). She received her PhD and MS in Aerospace
      Engineering from the University of Southern California, where she is currently

      the JRuby project, an effort to bring the beauty of Ruby and the power of the
      JVM together. Charles believes in open source and open standards and hopes his

    description: The JVM has traditionally hosted many languages, but only those closest
      to Java itself got the full optimization treatment. Those days are changing
      rapidly with new JVM features like invokedynamic and lambda, and with the rise
      of new frameworks like Truffle and Nashorn. In this talk we'll explore what
      it takes to optimize more exotic languages like JavaScript and Ruby and see
      how the JVM is evolving to do a better job. We'll see how projects like JRuby
      and Nashorn are trying to work around gaps in the JVM's optimizer. We'll see
      how JRuby+Truffle routes around the JVM to achieve blistering fast performance.
      And we'll look at upcoming projects on the JVM that will make language-building
      even easier.

      represent many data sets, such as social media networks, and iterative algorithms
      are important for Machine Learning, such as model training with gradient descent.

      continuous delivery, allows for the micro-services architecture and its companion

    description: In this full-day workshop, you will learn how to analyze and influence
      any system. (There's no such thing as "control"!) We will take a sociotechnical
      view of systems that draws on lean thinking, cybernetics, complex adaptive systems,
      and human factors. Using these perspectives, we will look at how systems work,
      how you can optimize them, and the many ways they can fail.

    description: Carbon Five has been using Agile XP from our very beginnings 14 years
      ago. Six years ago we started on a deep dive into Design Thinking inspired by
      collaborations with the Stanford d.school. We then extended those learnings,
      integrating Lean UX techniques, to help our clients focus the team's development
      power in a direction more closely aligned to a viable product market fit. Using
      two specific case studies and learnings from several other projects, I walk
      attendees through the weekly cadence that we use at Carbon Five during product
      development. This methodology and its activities establish a sustainable culture
      of integrated and invested teams that are able to communicate across disciplines
      in a meaningful way. The result of creating this type of culture via cadence
      allows our teams to put new features in front of users each week for validation
      and hence move the product closer to its market fit faster.

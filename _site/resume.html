          <strong>Hello. Finding a software developer to hire is not easy but let me ask you a few questions to see if I can help you out.</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          Are you looking for a software developer to enhance your team or can work independantly?
          <br>
          <br>
          How about a developer that can build a solid and maintainable software foundation for your business?
          <br>
          <br>
          Maybe you'd like to know that they will be able to help with defining the goals and tradeoffs required to fulfill your business's needs?
          <br>
          <br>
          Do <code>Ruby</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>SQL</code>, and <code>Linux</code> sound like <em>some</em> of the technologies you need the developer to have experience working with?
          <br>
          <br>
          "<em>Full-stack</em>" get's thrown around a lot but you might possibly need a developer who can work from the backend setting up and managing servers as well as being able to build out the API and frontend UI (although isn't a graphic designer)?
          <br>
          <br>
          Would you like to know that developer has solid experience working for companies like Groupon and Coderwall?
          <br>
          <br>
          If you answered "<strong>yes</strong>" to the above questions then this might be a great time for us to chat. Shoot an email to <strong><a href="mailto:mike@just3ws.com">mike@just3ws.com</a></strong> and we can chat about your needs are and how I can help you.

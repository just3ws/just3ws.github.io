Remember me Forgot your password?   Guest Martin Atkins Welcome To the User-Group Industry. You&#39;re
Going To Have a Good Time. Martin Atkins is an artist, teacher, author and musician who’s uniquely
open to new experiences. He started out as a drummer in bands like Public Image Limited and has had
a broad career of collaborations notably (for yours truly) with bands like NIN and Ministry. Most
recently he’s also published several books on surviving the music industry and has presented on the
music industry at conferences like Madison Ruby and ChicagoWebConf and has been sharing his
experiences running a successful Kickstarter Campaign. Let’s just say he’s a very busy fellow and
has some good thoughts that we should take the time to listen to. I’m very excited about this
interview and consider it a high point in my interviewing career. :) BTW, a Ministry tape was the
first piece of real musical rebellion I had squashed by my mom way back when I was a teenager, so
this is also a bit of a fan crush getting to speak with someone who helped create some of the music
I still enjoy. Make blackberry jam. Sponsored by ChicagoWebConf Interviewed on 2012-10-06 by Michael

1 2 3 4 5 … Next › Last » UGtastic grew from the belief that interacting with people for a few
minutes can convey more or different ideas than blogs and twitter. Based on that idea, we aim to
collect a a series of short interviews with individuals who run user-groups, meetups, tech
conferences or are otherwise involved in supporting technical communities. If any of the above
applies to you, or you&#39;re engaged in fun software related things like running large F/OSS projects,
speaking at conferences, or simply feel that yours is a unique perspective on technical communities,
we should have a chat! Drop a note here to set up an interview or let us know what you are working
on and how we can help. We&#39;d love a chance to learn something together. Published Interviews Welcome

<h3> 1999: The World Braced for Collapse—But I Was Planning My Escape  </h3>

<p> In <strong>December 1999</strong>, the world was fixated on <strong>Y2K</strong>. People feared that at the stroke of midnight, technology would fail—planes would fall from the sky, banks would lose all records, and the digital age would come crashing down.  </p>

<p> But I wasn’t worried about Y2K. <strong>I was planning my own escape.</strong>  </p>

<p> I was working at my <strong>father’s shop</strong>—unpaid, surviving on food and shelter, having to justify every dollar I asked for. My first real attempt at an IT career—a <strong>warehouse contract job assembling computers</strong>—had come and gone. I was <strong>back where I started, with no money and no path forward.</strong>  </p>

<p> By the time Y2K hit, I wasn’t bracing for disaster. I was making my move.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> Betting on the Future (Even When It’s Uncertain)  </h3>

<p> I found an early <strong>CareerBuilder</strong> job posting for a <strong>PC/Network Technician</strong> at <strong>C.H. Robinson</strong>. <strong>I didn’t meet all the requirements</strong>, but I had:  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Hands-on IT experience</strong> from my short-lived contract job.  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Freight forwarding knowledge</strong> from working for my father.  </p>

<p> C.H. Robinson was a <strong>freight company</strong>, so I made my case:  </p>

<blockquote> <strong>“I know the industry, and I know computers. I can learn the rest.”</strong>  </blockquote>

<p> That was enough. I got the job.  </p>

<p> But taking the job <strong>came at a cost.</strong>  </p>

<p> When I told my <strong>mother</strong> about the <strong>$42,000 salary</strong>, she <strong>immediately told me to take it</strong>—she would <strong>handle my father</strong>. But when I told him, his response was simple:  </p>

<blockquote> <strong>“You will come crawling back.”</strong>  </blockquote>

<p> He <strong>kicked me out</strong>, gave me a <strong>deadline to leave</strong>, and we didn’t talk for years.  </p>

<p> I never crawled back. But I did return—<strong>on my terms</strong>, standing alongside my then-girlfriend <strong>Aneta</strong>, who would become my wife and my greatest supporter.  </p>

<h3> 2025: The Future is Still Coming, and Fear Won’t Stop It  </h3>

<p> Today, people fear <strong>AI</strong> the way they feared <strong>Y2K</strong>.  </p>

<ul> <li> “It’s going to take all the jobs.” </li> <li> “We’re losing control of technology.” </li> <li> “We need to stop it before it’s too late.” </li> </ul>

<p> I understand the anxiety. But <strong>I feel the same way now that I did then</strong>:  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>There is no going back.</strong>   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Staying in place is not an option.</strong>   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>The only way forward is through.</strong>  </p>

<p> The lesson I learned in <strong>1999</strong> is the same one I carry in <strong>2025</strong>: <strong>The future is always uncertain, but it’s still worth building.</strong>  </p>

<p> Y2K didn’t end the world. AI won’t end the world either.  </p>

<p> What we do <strong>right now</strong>—how we <strong>adapt, learn, and build</strong>—is what matters.  </p>

<p> There was a boy who saw a wolf.  </p>

<p> He was a shepherd, living where the wild met the edges of civilization. His job was simple: protect the flock, watch the hills, and warn the village if danger came.  </p>

<p> One day, he saw the shadow of a wolf in the distance. He shouted to the village: <strong>“A wolf is coming!”</strong>  </p>

<p> By the time the villagers arrived, the wolf was gone. They saw nothing, shrugged, and walked back home.  </p>

<p> The boy, still uneasy, began reinforcing the fences, setting traps, and watching the darkness more carefully.  </p>

<p> The next day, he saw it again—closer this time. He called out once more: <strong>“The wolf is coming!”</strong>  </p>

<p> Again, the villagers arrived too late. And now, they were annoyed.  </p>

<p> <em>"Stop being so dramatic,"</em> they said. <em>"Why are you always making noise?"</em> <em>"If the wolf was real, we would have seen it too."</em>  </p>

<p> The boy wanted them to understand—this was not imagination. He wasn’t calling for fun. He was calling because he lived at the edge, where the safety of the village ended, and reality began.  </p>

<p> But the villagers had always been safe. To them, safety was normal. The idea of a wolf coming wasn’t real <strong>because it had never happened to them.</strong>  </p>

<h3> The Wolf Comes Anyway  </h3>

<p> One night, the boy saw the wolf slip through the trees and attack his sheep. He ran to the village, desperate, shouting louder than ever before. <strong>“The wolf is here!”</strong>  </p>

<p> The villagers, tired of his warnings, <strong>did nothing.</strong>  </p>

<p> By morning, the wolf had not only slaughtered the flock—it had entered the village. The villagers, unprepared, finally understood the danger. But it was too late.  </p>

<h3> Who Do They Blame?  </h3>

<p> Not themselves.  </p>

<p> Not their complacency.  </p>

<p> Not the false security of their village walls.  </p>

<p> They blame the boy.  </p>

<p> <em>"Why didn’t you warn us better?"</em> <em>"You should have told us in a way that made us listen."</em> <em>"You were too emotional about it—no wonder we didn’t take you seriously."</em>  </p>

<p> The boy, exhausted, wounded, and furious, stared at them in disbelief.  </p>

<p> <em>"I told you,"</em> he whispered. <em>"You just didn’t want to hear it."</em>  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Real Lesson of The Boy Who Cried Wolf  </h3>

<p> People misremember <em>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</em> as a story about honesty. But <strong>what if the boy was never lying?</strong>  </p>

<p> What if the real problem was <strong>not urgency, but apathy</strong>?  </p>

<p> This happens everywhere.  </p>

<ul> <li> The <strong>engineer</strong> who warns that the system is vulnerable. </li> <li> The <strong>scientist</strong> who warns of environmental collapse. </li> <li> The <strong>security expert</strong> who sees the breach before it happens. </li> <li> The <strong>worker</strong> who calls out a toxic leader before the damage spreads. </li> </ul>

<p> They see the wolf first. They warn the village. And instead of listening, the village argues about <strong>tone</strong>, about <strong>proof</strong>, about how the warning makes them <strong>feel</strong>.  </p>

<p> By the time the wolf arrives, the damage is done.  </p>

<p> And the worst part? The people who dismissed the warning will never admit fault. They’ll blame the messenger. They’ll say, <em>"If you had only warned us in the right way, we would have listened."</em>  </p>

<p> But that’s a lie.  </p>

<p> They didn’t listen <strong>because they didn’t want to.</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<h3> When Someone Warns You About the Wolf, Listen.  </h3>

<p> If someone is raising alarms—especially someone at the edge of the problem—<strong>don’t ignore them just because you don’t feel the danger yet.</strong>  </p>

<ul> <li><strong>Listen to the people closest to the problem.</strong></li> <li><strong>Don’t dismiss warnings just because they don’t sound the way you want them to.</strong></li> <li><strong>Don’t wait until the wolf is at your door to take it seriously.</strong></li> </ul>

<p> Because when that happens, it’s not just the boy who pays the price.  </p>

<p> It’s the whole village.  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“They’re Your Legs.”</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/02/01/they-re-your-legs.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“They’re Your Legs.”" /><published>2025-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/02/01/they-re-your-legs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/02/01/they-re-your-legs.html"><![CDATA[<figure><img src="/assets/images/writing/linkedin/2025-02-01-they-re-your-legs.jpg" alt="“They’re Your Legs.”"></figure>

<p> A few weeks ago, I was at Valvoline getting an oil change.  </p>

<p> It was a busy day—<strong>full bays, a strong shop lead keeping things moving, and a small crew working fast.</strong> Watching them coordinate, I was impressed. I was enjoying the moment so much that I even agreed to buy an air filter replacement—something I usually do myself.  </p>

<p> My car was due for a tire rotation, so I stepped out while they lifted it.  </p>

<p> The manager helped the younger mechanics <strong>stabilize the lift, ensuring it was locked in place before moving to the next car.</strong>  </p>

<p> Everything looked good.  </p>

<p> And then—<strong>I saw it.</strong>  </p>

<p> One of the mechanics sat <strong>cross-legged under the rear axle.</strong>  </p>

<p> 🚨 <strong>My dad’s voice hit me before I even realized I was moving.</strong> 🚨  </p>

<p> I was through the door. <strong>“Hey, don’t cross bones. Don’t trust that jack.”</strong>  </p>

<p> The young mechanic looked up. “I’m okay,” he said.  </p>

<p> I just shrugged. <strong>“Okay. They’re your legs.”</strong>  </p>

<p> And he moved back.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> A Team Owns Its Own Safety  </h3>

<p> Once they were done, I spoke with two of the younger mechanics—a <strong>young man who had been working on my car and a young woman who had been listening in as she finished her task.</strong>  </p>

<p> I reminded them about their buddy—the one who <strong>hand-waved</strong> his safety, the one who thought <strong>he’d be fine under the axle.</strong>  </p>

<p> I told them:  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Kneeling might be uncomfortable.</strong>   </p>

<p> 🚨 <strong>But it’s a lot more comfortable than getting crushed.</strong>  </p>

<p> And more importantly—<strong>his safety is their problem, too.</strong>  </p>

<p> If he gets pinned, it won’t just be <strong>his</strong> crisis. <strong>It’ll be theirs.</strong> It’ll be <strong>them</strong> trying to save him. It’ll be <strong>them</strong> listening to the screams.  </p>

<p> Because a team isn’t just responsible for their own safety. <strong>They’re responsible for making sure everyone makes it home.</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<h3> I Grew Up in a Shop. I Know What Happens When You Get It Wrong.  </h3>

<p> I grew up in a shop. My father was a <strong>lead diesel mechanic and later an owner-operator. Keeping him on the road was priority number one.</strong>  </p>

<p> By 13, I was <strong>breaking down truck tires, armed with nothing but a breaker bar and the will to get it done.</strong>  </p>

<p> By my late teens, I was running the yard while my dad was on the road. <strong>When he came back, he’d tell me what needed to be done, then go to sleep so he could get back on the highway.</strong>  </p>

<p> That meant I had to work <strong>alone</strong>—late at night, in a steel building, with machines that didn’t care if I lived or died.  </p>

<p> <strong>There was no room for mistakes.</strong>  </p>

<p> 🛠 <strong>I had to know how to be safe—because no one was there to save me if I wasn’t.</strong>   </p>

<p> 🛠 <strong>I had to respect the work—because there’s no such thing as "I’ll fix it later" when you’re under 80,000 pounds of steel.</strong>  </p>

<p> My dad drilled it into me:  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Never trust a jack.</strong> Always <strong>block and chock.</strong>   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Assume everything is heavier, sharper, and more dangerous than it looks.</strong>   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Know the difference between discomfort and disaster.</strong> A little discomfort today beats a lifetime of regret.   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Never rush safety.</strong> You’ll never get back the time you lose if you get it wrong.  </p>

<p> The lesson was clear:  </p>

<p> 👉 <strong>The best way to learn safety isn’t through experience—it’s through listening to those who already have it.</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<h3> This Moment Meant Something.  </h3>

<p> As I got into my car, I called out— <strong>“Hey, stay safe.”</strong>  </p>

<p> And he hollered back— <strong>“I will.”</strong>  </p>

<p> That moment stuck with me.  </p>

<p> I was raised to be independent. To survive. But when it comes to safety, no one is truly alone—it’s always a shared responsibility.  </p>

<p> Today, <strong>I’m not the kid in the shop anymore.</strong> I’m older. A professional software engineer. My world today is almost unimaginable to that younger version of me.  </p>

<p> But when I see someone who reminds me of <strong>the kid I used to be?</strong>  </p>

<p> I can’t walk away without making sure <strong>they know what I know.</strong>  </p>

<p> Because sometimes, that’s the difference between <strong>walking away from the job at the end of the day—</strong> And <strong>not walking at all.</strong>  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Moment of Absurdity in Stagnation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/31/a-moment-of-absurdity-in-stagnation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Moment of Absurdity in Stagnation" /><published>2025-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/01/31/a-moment-of-absurdity-in-stagnation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/31/a-moment-of-absurdity-in-stagnation.html"><![CDATA[<figure><img src="/assets/images/writing/linkedin/2025-01-31-a-moment-of-absurdity-in-stagnation.jpg" alt="A Moment of Absurdity in Stagnation"></figure>

<p> In the early 2000s, before .NET had solidified and JavaScript was still dismissed as a “toy language,” I worked at a small firm developing <strong>kiosk-based HR systems</strong>. The company was a skeleton crew—just the owner, a senior developer with a long corporate background, a part-time contractor, and me. The entire technology stack was <strong>VBScript, ASP, ActiveX, and IE6</strong>, dictated by a belief that <strong>staying deeply embedded in Microsoft’s ecosystem was the only “serious” way forward.</strong>  </p>

<p> One of my projects was an <strong>on-screen keyboard generator</strong>. The initial version in <strong>VBScript</strong> was bulky and slow, so I rewrote it in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, dramatically improving speed and maintainability. The next day, I was written up. Not because the solution didn’t work—it did—but because <strong>I had violated an unspoken rule</strong>. JavaScript was forbidden. It was, according to the senior developer, a “toy language,” and more people knew VBScript anyway.  </p>

<p> I sat across from him in the owner’s <strong>empty office</strong>, as he placed the write-up on the desk in front of me, taking the owner’s chair as if staging a corporate tribunal. The absurdity of the moment hit me then—<strong>he had no one but me and a part-time contractor to rely on. He depended on me entirely.</strong> Yet, here we were, engaged in a theater of control over something as trivial as which scripting language was used to accomplish the task.  </p>

<p> This pattern repeated when <strong>.NET</strong> entered the conversation. I suggested we explore it. The contractor agreed. But the senior developer shot it down without discussion. When the company’s <strong>one major client fell through</strong>, a potential buyout followed—only to collapse once the buyer realized the technology stack was already obsolete.  </p>

<p> The company folded soon after.  </p>

<p> In retrospect, that moment in the <strong>empty office</strong> encapsulated the entire downfall. A leader so preoccupied with controlling the present that he was blind to the future. So certain of his authority that he refused to see <strong>the walls closing in around him</strong>.  </p>

<p> I walked away from that experience with a simple lesson: <strong>sometimes, the greatest risk isn’t change—it’s refusing to change.</strong>  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Sound Above: Bridging Inspiration and Understanding in Tech</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/24/the-sound-above-bridging-inspiration-and-understanding-in-tech.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Sound Above: Bridging Inspiration and Understanding in Tech" /><published>2025-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/01/24/the-sound-above-bridging-inspiration-and-understanding-in-tech</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/24/the-sound-above-bridging-inspiration-and-understanding-in-tech.html"><![CDATA[<figure><img src="/assets/images/writing/linkedin/2025-01-24-the-sound-above-bridging-inspiration-and-understanding-in-tech.jpg" alt="The Sound Above: Bridging Inspiration and Understanding in Tech"></figure>

<h3> Defining the Sound Above  </h3>

<p> “The sound above” represents the echoes of ideas, inspirations, and cultural touchstones that have shaped an industry or a mindset. It’s the legacy carried forward by those who came before, forming an unspoken language and shared context among those who lived through it. For many in tech, <em>Star Trek</em> is part of that sound—a source of optimism, imagination, and exploration that inspired entire generations of programmers, engineers, and dreamers.  </p>

<p> But as time passes, the sound grows faint for those who didn’t grow up hearing it. To them, it’s not inspiration; it’s noise—opaque references that can feel like barriers instead of bridges.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> Star Trek and the Foundation of Tech  </h3>

<p> <em>Star Trek</em>, especially <em>The Next Generation</em>, holds a special place in the hearts of many who shaped the modern tech industry. The show’s vision of a future driven by exploration, collaboration, and technology as a force for good resonated deeply with the pioneers of computing. Episodes like <em>“Darmok”</em> embody the spirit of problem-solving, communication, and empathy—core values that underpin not just technology but how we work together as people.  </p>

<p> In <em>Darmok</em>, Captain Picard faces an impossible situation: the Tamarians speak entirely in metaphor, referencing their own history and culture in ways that are incomprehensible to outsiders. It’s only through shared struggle, patience, and a willingness to learn that Picard bridges the gap, finding connection where it seemed impossible. This is the heart of what <em>Star Trek</em> has always been—a lesson in overcoming differences through empathy, intellect, and collaboration.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The New Generation: A Different Sound  </h3>

<p> For those entering tech today, <em>Star Trek</em> isn’t the foundation—it’s a distant echo. To many, it’s just another cultural reference they’re expected to decode, one more hoop to jump through in an industry that already feels intimidating. It’s easy for them to see it as exclusionary, a marker of an in-group they’re not part of. And they’re not wrong—without context, a <em>Star Trek</em> reference might as well be Smurf language: familiar to some, meaningless to others.  </p>

<p> But what they may not see—and what senior leaders must help them see—is that <em>Star Trek</em> isn’t just a reference; it’s part of the sound above. It reflects the values and hopes of its time, just as today’s inspirations will shape the next generation of innovators. The task isn’t to force newcomers to learn <em>Star Trek</em> or pass a cultural test—it’s to build a bridge between what inspired us and what inspires them, so they too can contribute to the sound.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Challenge for Seniors: From Sound to Connection  </h3>

<p> As senior members of the tech industry, it’s our responsibility to adapt how we communicate and lead. We can’t assume that our references will automatically resonate with others. Instead, we must respect that new people bring their own inspirations, references, and perspectives—and that the gap isn’t a failure on their part. It’s an opportunity for us to connect.  </p>

<p> The way forward is through empathy:   </p>

<ol> <li> <strong>Be Receptive</strong>: Understand that new voices aren’t rejecting the past; they’re starting from a different place. Meet them where they are. </li> <li> <strong>Respect Their Inspirations</strong>: What inspires them might not look like <em>Star Trek</em>, and that’s okay. Their references are no less valid. </li> <li> <strong>Build Bridges</strong>: Share the sound above, not as a requirement, but as a gift. Show how the echoes of <em>Star Trek</em>—its optimism, its lessons in connection, its problem-solving spirit—can still inspire, but only if we make it accessible. </li> </ol>

<hr>

<h3> Why It Matters  </h3>

<p> The industry’s strength has always been its ability to build on what came before. But that only works if the foundation is shared. If we want the next generation to care about the sound above—to find inspiration in the values and stories that shaped us—we must first help them thrive. Only then can we inspire them to look up, to hear the echoes of the past and add their own notes to the sound of the future.  </p>

<p> In the end, it’s not about forcing people to learn <em>Star Trek</em>. It’s about showing them why it matters to us, and why it might matter to them, too. Just as Picard found a way to connect with the Tamarians, we must find a way to connect across the gaps of generations, culture, and experience. That’s the true spirit of <em>Star Trek</em>—to boldly go where understanding can be built.  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Power of People, Not Just AI</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/21/the-power-of-people-not-just-ai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Power of People, Not Just AI" /><published>2025-01-21T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-21T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/01/21/the-power-of-people-not-just-ai</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/21/the-power-of-people-not-just-ai.html"><![CDATA[<figure><img src="/assets/images/writing/linkedin/2025-01-21-the-power-of-people-not-just-ai.jpg" alt="The Power of People, Not Just AI"></figure>

<p> In an era where AI dominates conversations and headlines, it’s easy to feel like the future of work is all about machines solving problems for us. But the truth is simpler—and far more human.  </p>

<p> At its core, the work we do is still about people coming together to solve complex problems. And while AI has its place in that story, the most transformative changes I’ve seen are rooted in something profoundly human: <strong>collaboration, understanding, and connection.</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<h3> OpenTelemetry: A Catalyst for Change  </h3>

<p> For me, OpenTelemetry (OTel) has been one of the most powerful tools for driving these changes—not just as a technical solution, but as a cultural and collaborative one.  </p>

<p> OTel provides a framework for observability, enabling teams to measure, understand, and improve their systems. But its real value lies in how it brings people together:  </p>

<ul> <li> <strong>Conversations spark between teams</strong> that may never have collaborated before. </li> <li> <strong>Silos begin to connect</strong>, as shared dependencies and goals come into focus. </li> <li> <strong>Insights surface</strong> into the challenges and triumphs of other teams’ work, creating empathy and understanding across the organization. </li> </ul>

<p> The journey to system observability isn’t easy, and it’s far from complete. But even at this early stage, the impact is undeniable.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Human Impact of Observability  </h3>

<p> When we introduced observability, I didn’t just see better metrics or cleaner dashboards—I saw people talking.  </p>

<ul> <li> Teams that were once isolated began collaborating. </li> <li> Challenges that had been hidden in the complexity of our systems became apparent—and discussable. </li> <li> Contributors found new ways to align their efforts, building not just better systems, but better relationships. </li> </ul>

<p> This is the real value of OpenTelemetry. It’s a practical driver of technical conversations that are inclusive and empowering. And because it’s built on shared frameworks and standards, the innovation it sparks is <strong>empirically provable and wholly owned by the people doing the work.</strong>  </p>

<h3> AI’s Role in the Story  </h3>

<p> AI certainly has its place, and it can help us solve certain types of problems faster or more effectively. But when it comes to the complexity of understanding our systems—and, more importantly, the people behind them—there’s no substitute for human connection.  </p>

<p> OpenTelemetry shows us what’s possible when we focus on creating the conditions for collaboration. It’s not just a technical initiative; it’s a cultural shift, a spark for meaningful, distributed change that connects people across silos and teams.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> Starting the Journey  </h3>

<p> We’re still in the early stages of this journey. Observability isn’t perfect, and the work isn’t 100% done. But the act of starting—of creating a shared framework and encouraging collaboration—has already shown how much we can achieve together.  </p>

<p> The challenges of complex systems, siloed teams, and competing priorities are daunting. But OpenTelemetry has proven that even the smallest steps toward understanding can unlock meaningful change.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> A Call to Action  </h3>

<p> The future isn’t just about AI. It’s about <strong>people, working together to solve hard problems.</strong>  </p>

<ul> <li> It’s about creating frameworks that enable connection. </li> <li> It’s about breaking down silos and fostering collaboration. </li> <li> And it’s about starting the conversations that lead to real, lasting innovation. </li> </ul>

<p> If you’re considering a journey toward observability, don’t wait for perfection. The act of starting is enough to make a difference—not just for your systems, but for your people.  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What I Learned from Running Down a Hallway with Groupon’s CEO</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/18/what-i-learned-from-running-down-a-hallway-with-groupon-s-ceo.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What I Learned from Running Down a Hallway with Groupon’s CEO" /><published>2025-01-18T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/01/18/what-i-learned-from-running-down-a-hallway-with-groupon-s-ceo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/18/what-i-learned-from-running-down-a-hallway-with-groupon-s-ceo.html"><![CDATA[<figure><img src="/assets/images/writing/linkedin/2025-01-18-what-i-learned-from-running-down-a-hallway-with-groupon-s-ceo.jpg" alt="What I Learned from Running Down a Hallway with Groupon's CEO"></figure>

<p> Sometimes, a single question can change everything. For me, it wasn’t just a question—it was also a hallway run with Andrew Mason, Groupon’s CEO at the time, that shifted the trajectory of my career and taught me lessons I’m still unpacking to this day.  </p>

<p> It started with a lunch that almost didn’t happen. Our engineering team had been scheduled to meet Andrew for months, but the meeting kept getting rebooked. By the time it finally happened, most of our team was at a conference, leaving just a few of us behind. We assumed the lunch would be postponed again, but it wasn’t. Nervously, a small group of us sat down in a meeting room, unsure what to expect.  </p>

<p> As we waited, we saw Andrew approach through the glass walls of the office. He glanced in, did a double take, consulted with his assistant, and hesitated for a moment. I’ll never forget that moment of hesitation—it was as if he was deciding whether this meeting was worth his time. Then, he shrugged, walked in, and greeted us enthusiastically.  </p>

<p> That decision—to step into a meeting with a smaller group than expected—would end up being pivotal for me, though I didn’t know it yet.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Question That Changed Everything  </h3>

<p> The lunch was casual, filled with sushi and light conversation about engineering culture and corporate vision. Toward the end, Andrew asked if we had any questions. I hesitated, then decided to speak up:  </p>

<p> <em>"Are you aware of the current attrition rate?"</em>  </p>

<p> Andrew was surprised but thoughtful. His initial answer—that attrition was within industry norms—wasn’t unexpected. But I followed up:  </p>

<p> <em>"Does that account for who is leaving?"</em>  </p>

<p> I pointed out that many of our most skilled and experienced engineers—those who had been with Groupon from the earliest days—were leaving.  </p>

<p> Andrew didn’t dismiss the question. He considered it and said he’d look into it. The lunch wrapped up shortly after, and I figured that was the end of it.  </p>

<p> But it wasn’t.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Hallway Run  </h3>

<p> As I walked back to my desk, I heard someone call out: <em>"Hey, hey, what’s your name?"</em> I turned to see Andrew running down the hallway toward me. He was out of breath by the time he reached me, but he didn’t care about the stares from passing employees. He motioned for me to follow him.  </p>

<p> We ran through the office—me, completely bewildered, and Andrew, completely unfazed. Eventually, we arrived at an open-plan intersection where a group of people were deep in conversation with Brian, who was essentially head of engineering. Andrew, still catching his breath, didn’t hesitate to interrupt.  </p>

<p> <em>"Mike, this is Brian. Brian, this is Mike. Mike, tell Brian everything you just told me."</em>  </p>

<p> And then he ran off, leaving me standing there, completely stunned, in the middle of the intersection with Brian and half a dozen others who had clearly been in the middle of something important.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Moment That Changed Everything  </h3>

<p> That moment was life-altering for me, though it likely wasn’t a big deal for Andrew. At the height of Groupon, with millions of things vying for his attention, he heard something I said and decided it mattered enough to act on immediately.  </p>

<p> For me, it was overwhelming. At the time, I didn’t fully understand the weight of what had just happened. It was like being hit by a really cool car in an entirely unexpected circumstance—not something I planned for, but something I couldn’t ignore.  </p>

<p> That conversation led to a new role as the "Talent Development Business Partner for Engineering," a role I could never have imagined for myself when I first began transitioning into software development.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> More Than I Thought Possible  </h3>

<p> When I took my first timid steps into this new phase of my career, I struggled to believe I was worthy to work with the brilliant minds of Obtiva, let alone play any meaningful role in a company like Groupon. I thought being a Software Developer would be more than enough—that just reaching that point was my goal.  </p>

<p> But this moment, this role, this responsibility—it was so much more than I could have imagined. And, honestly, it was more than I could bear at the time. I didn’t feel ready to be "more." It was intimidating to step into something so far beyond what I thought was possible for me.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Leadership Lesson  </h3>

<p> That experience taught me a profound lesson about leadership: the further you are from the day-to-day realities of your employees, the harder it becomes to recover when you lose their trust or perspective.  </p>

<p> Attrition isn’t just a metric; it’s a story. When you look at who is leaving, you begin to understand the unspoken dynamics shaping your organization.  </p>

<p> Andrew didn’t just listen—he acted. That’s the part I reflect on most often. Listening is one thing, but acting before the moment passes you by is what makes the difference.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> Why This Matters Now  </h3>

<p> Organizations often talk about transformation, innovation, and growth. But none of those are possible without the people who make them happen. If you’re in a leadership position, I encourage you to ask yourself: <em>What am I missing? Who should I be listening to? What action can I take today to bridge the gap between strategy and experience?</em>  </p>

<p> Sometimes, listening means sitting down over sushi. Other times, it means running down a hallway. Either way, it means acting when the opportunity presents itself—even if it’s unexpected.  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Power of Titles: What I Misunderstood</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/the-power-of-titles-what-i-misunderstood.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Power of Titles: What I Misunderstood" /><published>2025-01-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/the-power-of-titles-what-i-misunderstood</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/the-power-of-titles-what-i-misunderstood.html"><![CDATA[<figure><img src="/assets/images/writing/linkedin/2025-01-14-the-power-of-titles-what-i-misunderstood.jpg" alt="The Power of Titles: What I Misunderstood"></figure>

<p> For most of my career, I’ve eschewed titles. I saw people chase them like prizes—coveting authority without earning respect, collecting accolades without delivering results. I didn’t want to be like that. I thought my work should speak for itself, that my results would be my title.  </p>

<p> But that was my mistake.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> What I Misunderstood About Titles  </h3>

<p> I thought rejecting titles meant rejecting ego, politics, and posturing. What I didn’t realize was that titles aren’t just symbols of power—they’re tools of utility. They’re shorthand for your role, your value, and your expertise in a world where time is scarce and perceptions matter.  </p>

<p> Here’s what I misunderstood:  </p>

<ol> <li> <strong>Titles Shape Perception</strong> A title can mean the difference between being invited to the table or left outside the room. It doesn’t matter if you’re the most qualified person in the building—if your role doesn’t reflect that, people won’t know to include you. </li> <li> <strong>Titles Signal Authority</strong> Titles grant weight to your voice. Without them, even your best ideas can be dismissed or overlooked—not because they lack merit, but because people instinctively defer to perceived authority. </li> <li> <strong>Titles Protect Your Work</strong> A title isn’t just about status; it’s about accountability. When your role is clearly defined and respected, it’s harder for others to co-opt your contributions or sideline your expertise. </li> </ol>

<hr>

<h3> Why I Avoided Titles  </h3>

<p> I avoided titles because of what I’d seen them represent:  </p>

<ul> <li> People chasing promotions for the sake of appearances. </li> <li> Colleagues using their titles as shields to deflect accountability. </li> <li> Leaders wielding authority without the competence to back it up. </li> </ul>

<p> To me, titles seemed like distractions from what really mattered: the work. But I failed to see the bigger picture.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> What I’ve Learned About Utility  </h3>

<p> Titles aren’t inherently good or bad—it’s what you do with them that matters. For someone like me, who values integrity, collaboration, and results, a title isn’t about ego. It’s about utility. It’s about:  </p>

<ul> <li><strong>Making your contributions visible.</strong></li> <li><strong>Amplifying your voice.</strong></li> <li><strong>Ensuring your seat at the table.</strong></li> </ul>

<p> A title is a tool—not a prize. And in rejecting it, I gave others tools to define me, to speak over me, and to take credit for work they didn’t do.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> Moving Forward  </h3>

<p> I still don’t covet titles. But I no longer reject them outright. I recognize their utility—not as symbols of status, but as tools for impact. Titles aren’t about what they mean to <em>me</em>; they’re about what they signal to others. They’re a key to opening doors, shaping conversations, and protecting the value I bring to the table.  </p>

<p> So no, I don’t want your job. But I do want the recognition and respect that come with doing it well. Titles can help me achieve that—not for vanity, but for fairness. That’s not a mistake I’ll make again.  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Dog Who Caught Their Tail: The Best Collaborators I’ve Worked With</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/the-dog-who-caught-their-tail-the-best-collaborators-i-ve-worked-with.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Dog Who Caught Their Tail: The Best Collaborators I’ve Worked With" /><published>2025-01-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/the-dog-who-caught-their-tail-the-best-collaborators-i-ve-worked-with</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/14/the-dog-who-caught-their-tail-the-best-collaborators-i-ve-worked-with.html"><![CDATA[<figure><img src="/assets/images/writing/linkedin/2025-01-14-the-dog-who-caught-their-tail-the-best-collaborators-i-ve-worked-with.jpg" alt="The Dog Who Caught Their Tail: The Best Collaborators I've Worked With"></figure>

<p> Some people step into new roles like a dog catching its tail—they’ve achieved something they’ve worked hard for, but the real test comes after the title. Among the best collaborators I’ve worked with are those who make this transition not just about themselves, but about the people around them. They don’t just take on responsibility; they elevate everyone involved.  </p>

<p> This isn’t about avoiding mistakes—it’s about embracing growth and collaboration. These are the traits that make someone truly great to work with.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Strengths of Outstanding Leaders  </h3>

<p> The best people in new roles have a way of turning potential vulnerabilities into opportunities for connection. They do this by focusing on a few key behaviors:  </p>

<ul> <li> <strong>Sharing Context:</strong> They understand that information is most valuable when it’s shared. Instead of hoarding knowledge, they ensure everyone is aligned and equipped to contribute meaningfully. </li> <li> <strong>Seeking Input:</strong> They’re not afraid to admit they don’t know everything. By inviting perspectives, they build trust and create space for better solutions. </li> <li> <strong>Celebrating Collaboration:</strong> They recognize that working with others isn’t a weakness—it’s the key to collective success. </li> </ul>

<p> These behaviors build trust, foster innovation, and make collaboration not just productive but genuinely enjoyable.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> The Impact of Great Collaborators  </h3>

<p> When someone approaches leadership with humility and openness, it transforms the way teams function. Here’s what I’ve noticed about the best collaborators:  </p>

<ul> <li> <strong>They Remove Obstacles:</strong> By sharing context and being transparent, they make it easier for everyone to do their best work. </li> <li> <strong>They Build Trust:</strong> Open communication creates an environment where people feel safe to share ideas, admit mistakes, and ask for help. </li> <li> <strong>They Inspire Confidence:</strong> By valuing input and celebrating contributions, they make their teammates feel seen and appreciated. </li> </ul>

<p> This dynamic doesn’t just improve outcomes—it strengthens relationships and creates a sense of shared purpose.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> How to Foster Collaborative Intersections  </h3>

<p> The magic happens at the intersections where collaboration thrives. Here’s what the best people I’ve worked with do to make that happen:  </p>

<h3> For New Leaders  </h3>

<ol> <li><strong>Share Context Freely</strong></li> <li><strong>Ask for Input</strong></li> <li><strong>Celebrate Wins Together</strong></li> </ol>

<h3> For Teammates  </h3>

<ol> <li><strong>Be Proactive in Offering Support</strong></li> <li><strong>Focus on Solutions</strong></li> <li><strong>Build Relationships Through Transparency</strong></li> </ol>

<hr>

<h3> What Great Collaboration Looks Like  </h3>

<p> The best collaborators understand that leadership isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about creating an environment where everyone can thrive. They model humility, transparency, and curiosity, which in turn inspires their teammates to do the same.  </p>

<p> Collaboration is a two-way street. When leaders and teammates bring their best selves to the table, the result is more than just successful projects—it’s a culture of trust and mutual growth.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> Closing Thoughts  </h3>

<p> If you’re stepping into a new role, remember that your title isn’t the end of the journey—it’s the beginning. And if you’re working with someone in that position, focus on creating collaborative intersections where both sides can learn and grow.  </p>

<p> The best people I’ve worked with know this: Together, we’re not just chasing tails—we’re building something better.  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stand Up and Fight: Running the Gauntlet of Change</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/12/stand-up-and-fight-running-the-gauntlet-of-change.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stand Up and Fight: Running the Gauntlet of Change" /><published>2025-01-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/01/12/stand-up-and-fight-running-the-gauntlet-of-change</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/01/12/stand-up-and-fight-running-the-gauntlet-of-change.html"><![CDATA[<figure><img src="/assets/images/writing/linkedin/2025-01-12-stand-up-and-fight-running-the-gauntlet-of-change.jpg" alt="Stand Up and Fight: Running the Gauntlet of Change"></figure>

<p> Change, whether in ourselves or the systems we inhabit, is rarely easy. It’s a battle—a gauntlet—of meetings, justifications, setbacks, and uncertainty. For anyone who’s fought to make a project, a vision, or even a career change a reality, the battlefield can feel endless and isolating. But it’s not insurmountable.  </p>

<div></div>

<p> Dropkick Murphys’ <em>“The Gauntlet”</em> captures the essence of that struggle. Its lyrics, steeped in resilience and determination, provide a framework for how to approach the battlefield of change and emerge stronger, even when the odds feel stacked against you.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> “When the walls are closing in…”  </h3>

<blockquote> <em>“I was weighing in heavy but still feeling alright…”</em>  </blockquote>

<p> I’ve stood at the edge of uncertainty, from my blue-collar roots to transitioning into a career in technology. Changing my life wasn’t a sure thing—there was no guarantee I’d succeed. The walls often felt like they were closing in, whether it was self-doubt or the resistance I encountered in systems that didn’t want to change.  </p>

<p> The key was recognizing that the weight of those challenges didn’t define me. I had to remind myself: feeling the weight is part of the process. You’re not failing because it’s hard—you’re growing because you keep going despite it.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> “Do you think we’re gonna make it? / I don’t know unless we try…”  </h3>

<blockquote> <em>“You could sit here scared to move or we could take them by surprise.”</em>  </blockquote>

<p> This lyric speaks directly to the core of action. There’s a moment in every battle—whether it’s for a professional goal, a personal vision, or systemic change—where you face a choice: sit back, or step forward.  </p>

<p> For me, stepping forward meant planting seeds long before anyone could see their value. It meant justifying solutions in meeting after meeting, facing skepticism, and holding onto the belief that what I was doing <em>mattered</em>, even when the results weren’t immediate. The lesson? You won’t know if you can make it until you try. And trying means taking the first step, even when success feels uncertain.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> “They’re gonna prey upon your weakness…”  </h3>

<blockquote> <em>“No man’s soul is ever spared.”</em>  </blockquote>

<p> In every gauntlet, your weaknesses will be tested. I learned this early—both in labor-intensive jobs and in white-collar environments. People will question your vision, your ability, and even your motives. Systems will resist change, and you’ll be forced to confront your own fears and insecurities.  </p>

<p> The only way to survive is to prepare. Know your vulnerabilities and build resilience. When I entered tech, I didn’t have all the answers, but I was relentless in learning, adapting, and improving. That’s how you protect your soul: by refusing to let the doubts—whether internal or external—define you.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> “You’ve got to stand up, yeah, and fight them…”  </h3>

<blockquote> <em>“Show them what it’s all about.”</em>  </blockquote>

<p> This is the anthem of every meeting where I’ve had to fight for solutions that weren’t immediately obvious to others. The project no one believed in. The processes that felt too ambitious. The long, uphill battle of transforming legacy systems that others had given up on. Each of these moments was a fight—not against people, but against inertia, apathy, and fear of change.  </p>

<p> Standing up means having clarity of purpose and the courage to see it through. It’s not about aggression—it’s about conviction. When I’ve stood up in meetings, it’s been with a mindset of collaboration, even when I’ve had to fight for my vision. Every fight was a step forward.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> “Stand up and fight! / And I’ll stand up with you…”  </h3>

<blockquote> <em>“We shall succeed.”</em>  </blockquote>

<p> The journey is never a solo endeavor. I’ve leaned on mentors, partners, and colleagues who believed in me when I struggled to believe in myself. And I’ve tried to be that support for others—encouraging them to stand up and fight for their own visions.  </p>

<p> This lyric reminds us that we’re not alone. Whether you’re leading a team or finding your way in a new role, solidarity matters. When you stand up for what’s right, you inspire others to do the same. Together, you can achieve more than you ever could alone.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> “They won’t get me, they won’t get me…”  </h3>

<blockquote> <em>“I would rather fight and die.”</em>  </blockquote>

<p> There were times when the resistance felt overwhelming—when my ideas were dismissed or my confidence was shaken. But this lyric became my mantra. It’s a reminder that standing your ground, even when it’s hard, is better than compromising your values or vision.  </p>

<p> Not every battle will be won, and not every seed will grow. But the act of fighting for what matters—to you, to your team, to your organization—is its own reward. It’s how you grow, learn, and ultimately succeed.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> A Call to Action: Running Your Gauntlet  </h3>

<p> To anyone facing their own gauntlet—whether it’s changing your career, transforming a system, or realizing a personal vision—this is your moment to stand up and fight. Here’s what I’ve learned:   </p>

<ol> <li> <strong>Prepare for the unexpected.</strong> The path won’t be what you think, but that’s part of the process.  </li> <li> <strong>Focus on what you can control.</strong> Plant the seeds, even when others can’t see their value yet.  </li> <li> <strong>Lean on others.</strong> You don’t have to fight alone. Build a network of people who will stand with you.  </li> <li> <strong>Keep moving forward.</strong> Progress is slow, but every step matters. </li> </ol>

<p> The gauntlet isn’t just a struggle—it’s a transformation. It’s where you find out who you are and what you’re capable of. And when you emerge on the other side, you’ll know: the fight was worth it.  </p>

<p> So, what’s your gauntlet? Will you stand up and fight?  </p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Hall</name><email>mike@just3ws.com</email></author><category term="linkedin" /><category term="republished" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>

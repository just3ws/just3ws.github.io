<p>The actors are assembled for the Writer’s play.  Some will play heroes, and some villains while most will walk through the scene forgotten and unheard.  The Director moves the actors through the tragedy and comedy and the quiet moments in-between.  When the script is done and the speaking stops the curtains draw and the all is ended.  The cast is called to take a bow, is the villain still applauded?  Or is he taken away and punished for his role?  Is the hero to be knighted?  The Writer wrote their deeds and they played their part as it was already decided.  Who will be invited to the post-production party?</p>

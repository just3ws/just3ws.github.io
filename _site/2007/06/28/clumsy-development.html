<p>Basically it’s the <a href="https://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheOpposite.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">George Costanza</a> model of software development.  The only requirement is to know the vocabulary, not that you need to know what the words mean though.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p>Agile says to not have constantly changing priorities while expecting your developers to change on a dime.  </p>
<p>Clumsy says, the more projects the better, what else are the developers going to do with their time?  Test, bah!</p>
<p>Agile says to keep meetings to a minimum.</p>
<p>Clumsy says that whoever passes out from lack of oxygen first wins.</p>
<p>Agile cares about the developer’s quality of life and acknowledges that it is important for the long term success of the project.</p>
<p>Clumsy says “Whip the horse until it’s dead.” (This I have on reliable hearsay was an actual statement made by someone with a very fancy title and doors on his office.)</p>

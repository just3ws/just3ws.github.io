<p>Coding Horror posted an article in 2006 that proposed a <a href="https://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programmers Bill of Rights</a>.  I’ve worked at some pretty messed up places that violated all or most of these “rights”.  Although I know that the word “rights” was used in a tongue-in-cheek manner the point was that these things make sense.  Calling it a “Bill of Rights” was meant to get the readers attention, but it’s fair to call the list “Common Sense”.  To be fair, most of these things I’d be happy to get myself if I’m paid well enough, but somethings can only be provided by the employer, such as the quiet working conditions and fast internet connection.

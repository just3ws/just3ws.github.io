    <p>Whenever you think you have the toughest, nastiest and unpleasant job ever then you may need to watch a show that my wife and I have been enjoying for a while now that I think will put those thoughts to rest permanently.<br><br><b><a href="https://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/dirtyjobs/dirtyjobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirty Jobs</a></b><br><br>The show is about the backbreaking, nasty, gross, yucky and usually very interesting jobs that are performed to keep our civilization running smoothly. The host, Mike Rowe, is no fainting flower journalist who only observes from afar. Mike gets in and sticks his hands into some of the most unpleasant places and substances.<br><br>Each episode usually consists of Mike traveling to various locations around the country to showcase 2-3 different industries. He's been to cattle breeders (the hands in unpleasant places) to sewage treatment plants (the unpleasant substances) to alligator farms. And he seems to do his best to try to do the work of whatever occupation is being spotlighted, usually with humorous and sometimes successful results.<br><br>What makes the show good and makes my wife and I fans, is not just the topics and locations. It's how Mike treats the people that are being showcased. He really seems down-to-earth and doesn't condescend or look down his nose, nor does he kiss their butts either. He gives as good as he gets and sometimes the banter with the hosts is the most entertaining part.<br><br>Chances are there are jobs being done in America that you have no idea about. Watch Dirty Jobs on the Discovery Channel and find out what happens after you flush.</p>

    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2014. I\n'm sitting here with Jez Humble,\n who today presented on DevOps, and he's got a background as\n the co-author of the Continuous\n Delivery book, and he also was working on another book that\n we'll get into in a minute,\n but also, and also, and also, you're a busy person. He's\n working on a new conference called\n FlowCon, but first, you know, thank you for taking the time\n to speak with me.\n Thanks for having me.\n Your talk today was on DevOps. Can you tell us a little bit\n more about what part of DevOps\n and what does, DevOps is one of those terms that means a\n lot of things to different people.\n You helped write the book on Continuous Delivery, which\n helped lead into kind of what we call\n DevOps.\n Can you tell us a little bit about what that means to you,\n and how that relates to your\n talk today?\n Yeah, so, I mean, which is a very big question, and debate\n rages on how to define DevOps and\n what DevOps really is, but for me, ultimately, DevOps is\n about creating a culture in which\n we're always learning how to get better at creating, and\n evolving, and operating great\n products and services.\n With a particular focus on...\n ...collaboration between all the different people involved\n in doing that, whether that's\n the engineers, the UX people, the operations people, and\n all the various groups who are\n involved in doing that.\n So it isn't just about deploying. It's about the whole\n application cycle, from code writing\n to delivery.\n Yeah, and, you know, even outside that cycle, I mean, the\n point of Continuous Delivery is\n to give you this capability to be able to get changes out\n fast to users in a low-risk way,\n and to make it...\n ...economic to work in small batches, but once you have\n that capability, the question\n then becomes, \"What do you do with it?\"\n And I think, you know, the people in the DevOps field will\n tell you that you use that for\n creating a feedback loop so that you can make sure that you\n're working on the right things,\n so that you're building things that actually delight users\n and improve the customer experience.\n And so it kind of feeds into that whole discussion around\n building things that are delightful\n and better serve our customers.\n Right, and is that what your goal of your talk was today?\n Actually, what was the title of the talk?\n The title of the talk...\n It was a long one.\n It was.\n You have a lot of very long titles.\n I do, yeah.\n Sorry about that.\n So, yeah, \"DevOps: Culture and Practices to Create Flow.\"\n \"DevOps: Culture and Practices to Create Flow,\" and flow\n being...\n Flow being being able to get ideas out to users as quickly\n as possible, so I mean,\n the question of the thing that is actually doing the\n flowing was kind of the premise\n for the talk, right?\n Because I go back to the Toyota production system, and the\n idea of flow in the context\n of the Toyota production system is the customer puts in an\n order, \"I want this car.\n How fast can you get it to them?\"\n Right.\n So there's this kind of idealized concept of one-piece flow\n of being able to go from\n customer order all the way through to delivering the\n vehicle as a single piece of flow with\n no kind of interruptions and cues or anything like that,\n which is unachievable, but the idea\n is that you're always moving towards that.\n And so the idea is, what's the equivalent of that in the\n context of software development?\n And so my contention is that what you should be looking at\n is check-ins, creating builds,\n and trying to get those builds out to users as fast and as\n safely as possible.\n And how do you actually do that?\n Okay.\n And some people, that is, even at the very beginning of how\n to write software is a controversial\n topic right now with TDD.\n Right.\n You know, is TDD that?\n Right.\n It's not how to write software, much less how to finally\n get something to that end-user.\n Is that something you've been experienced or having\n conversations about, like trying\n to figure out those kind of things with your teams?\n Yeah.\n Absolutely.\n I mean, one of the things that, again, I said in the talk\n and I also say in the book and\n to anyone who'll listen to me, frankly, is that you've got\n to build quality into the\n product.\n So the idea that you can somehow write some code and then\n there's like quality activity\n a bit further down where you find out if it's any good,\n that doesn't work, or you have like\n a separate quality team.\n It's the responsibility of the people building the software\n to build quality in.\n And one of the ways that you do that is through TDD, by\n making sure the developers are responsible\n for writing the tests that show that their software does\n what users want and what they\n expect of it.\n I mean, TDD is a whole other topic in its own right, and\n you know, one of the things\n for me about TDD is, you know, going back to the idea of\n satisfying the user, what we\n do in TDD is we put ourselves, it forces us to put\n ourselves in the perspective of the\n user of the software.\n Right.\n The first thing you do when you write a test is, you know,\n when you're starting TDD\n for a new module or component or class or function, you\n think about what's the API?\n Because you have to write the test against an API that\n doesn't exist yet.\n Right.\n So you're designing the API which puts you in the\n perspective of the user.\n Yeah.\n And that for me is a really important part of TDD, it\n forces developers to think as a\n consumer of the software they're about to build.\n Right.\n And design an API that's simple to use and simple to test.\n Yeah, you get that pain early that, like, whoa, what comes\n here?\n Right.\n And actually, once you've worked out the right test to\n write, actually writing the code that\n implements that should be relatively easy.\n The hard bit is working out what the test should look like.\n Right.\n And so that, I think, actually is very, you know, there's a\n very lean aspect of that.\n And just, you know, jumping straight over into, you alluded\n to a book that you're working\n on.\n Is that also in the same vein of topic or is this, what is\n the book?\n So, the book is called Lean Enterprise, and the book is\n about how large companies can\n innovate at scale.\n Okay.\n And so, excuse me, pardon me, the problem that we have with\n the continuous delivery\n book is we talk about the technical practices and the\n principles behind them, but organizations\n have trouble implementing it.\n And we see it time and time again, people say, \"Oh, we'd\n love to do this, but we can't because\n of, oh, excuse me again, we can't because of our\n architecture or because of governance\n or because of compliance or because of our budgeting\n process.\"\n And so, the book tries to address the whole ecosystem of\n innovation.\n How do you build and grow a company that can innovate at\n scale?\n You know, big companies who don't treat IT as a competitive\n advantage find it very hard.\n I mean, IT ends up being a critical path.\n Right.\n There's no investment in it.\n It's treated as an, you know, an order to-\n A cost center.\n Yeah, a cost center, an order-taking function.\n And then, you know, it takes ages to get anything done\n because it has to follow all these rules.\n Imagine if your software actually was a competitive\n advantage to your business, how would you\n do things differently?\n And of course, there are companies who do do that, you know\n, Netflix and Google and\n all these other kinds of companies that are doing this\n stuff at scale actually treat software\n as part of their product development process.\n And it's central to how they innovate and it's kind of\n exploring how enterprises can\n adopt that culture.\n And I can see how some of this, all of these things can be\n daunting for somebody who's\n adopting them because even these terms, lean, flow, now I'm\n forgetting the other one, but\n they have multiple meanings in different contexts, like\n when you described flow, my first earlier,\n when you described flow.\n I was thinking about developer flow and then you're talking\n about product flow and it's,\n is it been something that's been a challenge making sure\n that people understand these terms\n that have been used in different contexts, that they\n understand the context of what you're\n talking about?\n Yeah, I mean, it's a huge problem, even understanding the\n concepts and understanding\n the names and then understanding how they fit together and,\n you know, people make basic\n mistakes with this.\n You know, again, it's not because they're stupid, it's\n because it's genuinely difficult\n and counterintuitive.\n And a lot of people think that lean is about cutting costs.\n Lean is not about cutting costs.\n Lean is about reducing waste and by reducing waste, we end\n up with lower costs, but you\n don't just go about looking for expensive things and cut\n them out of the budget.\n Right, right.\n But people do that.\n People are like, well, we're going to go lean.\n That means we're going to reduce our head count and we'll\n actually know that's not the\n case.\n And again, if you look at Toyota, I mean, in Japanese\n culture until quite recently,\n everybody had a job for life, so you could never fire\n anyone.\n So the idea with lean was that you would increase\n productivity by, you know, making people more\n efficient at what they did and more effective at what they\n did.\n And that frees up people to work on higher value things\n instead.\n And what they would do is they would use the efficiency\n gains they got through applying\n the principles to drive the growth of the company.\n Because those people who were doing all this low level\n stuff are now freed up to do high\n level stuff.\n And now we can do more stuff.\n And so that means we can expand our market or introduce new\n products, you know, it gives\n you the power to do all these additional things.\n Whereas a lot of people adopting lean, they think it's\n about, you know, making people\n redundant and firing them so we can reduce costs.\n Right.\n No, absolutely not.\n That's totally not the point.\n But you know, this is just one of many misconceptions and\n it's very counterintuitive.\n And it's, and it's even, this is a word that has come up in\n a lot of interviews is empathy.\n You know, trying to put your mind into the listener's mind.\n And, and that's, that's always a trick, you know, here we\n're doing these interviews is\n trying to, to take what are my own biases, like when I hear\n lean, I'm a developer.\n So I'm thinking, I mean, I'll flow, I'm thinking developer\n flow.\n So when you're, when you're at these presentations, do you\n often get people that are, or when\n you're talking these topics, do you often get people\n surprised or pushed back or expecting\n something different and, and have to be brought back into\n the fold or.\n Yeah.\n I mean, a lot of the time, I mean, because, you know,\n people come up and they, you know,\n they expect me also to be a continuous delivery guy.\n We need to be talking about these very technical things.\n And I found that the technical stuff is not the problem.\n The problem is leadership and culture.\n And so I tend to talk about those things these days.\n And, you know, I've been doing a bunch of research in my\n book.\n So what comes out in my talks is basically a lot of the\n research I've been doing from\n the book and, and, and talking about that stuff.\n And that's not what people often expect to talk about.\n Um, but in my experience is the most important stuff.\n So yeah, I mean, I kind of hope that people will come and\n be excited by some of this stuff\n and be inspired.\n I mean, the most I can hope is that people come away with a\n bunch of ideas for things\n they can try out.\n That's what I really hope, but you know, people are not\n necessarily going to get what they\n come for.\n Um, and, uh, yeah, so one of the things I want to do is say\n, sorry to the people that\n didn't get what they were expecting out in the talks.\n Maybe they got something that they can use.\n What do they say?\n You didn't get what you asked for, but you got what you\n needed.\n Right.\n Hopefully, hopefully.\n Well, and then just to, to segue straight into your\n conference that you're working on,\n um, FlowConf, it's obviously something that's related to\n this topic, but what is it?\n Where is it?\n Okay.\n So this year it's, uh, the week of Labor Day, uh, 3rd of\n September and 4th of September\n in San Francisco.\n Uh, you go to flowcon.org, flowcon.org and, uh, my fabulous\n British accent.\n Okay.\n With a W.\n Yes.\n F-L-O-W-C-O-N.org.\n Um, and the idea of the conference is to explore the whole\n range of stuff that goes into building\n great products and services.\n So we talk about UX, we talk about product development, we\n talk about, you know, deep\n dive on technical topics, talk about culture and we talk\n about all those things.\n And the idea is to emphasize the fact, A, that it's a cross\n-functional activity.\n So, you know, we don't have a developer track and a UX\n track.\n And, uh, abstract, because that kind of goes against the\n whole principle, which is that\n we all have to work together and we explore all the\n different aspects that go into creating\n great products.\n Yeah.\n The developers need to know more about the business,\n business or the needs and empathy,\n have more empathy with what the business needs and the\n business needs to understand what\n they're asking.\n So everybody needs to kind of get empathy.\n Yeah, exactly.\n No, and that's absolutely right, I mean, my personal\n experience, I, I wanted to design\n a conference that reflects our industry as I want it to\n look, not as it looks right now.\n And I also kind of wanted to think about, you know, what\n makes a great conference.\n When I go to a conference, I often will attend topics that\n I don't know very much about so\n that I can just get my mind blown.\n Right.\n Um, I really enjoy that experience.\n So I kind of wanted to go to a conference where you could\n see a bunch of things that\n were related to what you do, but not directly related, so\n tangentially related and get an\n idea of how all this stuff fits together to create a bigger\n picture, because again, one\n of the things that I lean is, you know, you can't just\n optimize your particular part.\n You've got to think about the whole and think about the\n high-level objectives of what you're\n doing.\n So, you know, it's important to think about all these other\n things and how they fit together\n and as you say, create empathy for all those different\n people and what they're trying to\n do.\n So the conference is focused on that and on real stories of\n people doing real things,\n um, in difficult situations.\n September 3rd and 4th, San Francisco, flocon.org.\n Yeah, and if you register before May the 30th, there's an\n early bird, so you get it cheap.\n Great.\n Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.\n Pleasure.\n Thanks so much for having me.\n Thanks.\n User groups with lots to say, interviews and more.\n No way!\n Sharing great ideas in the tech community, fascinating\n conversations, a plethora of information,\n find out for yourself today at ucdastic.com.\n Thank you.",

 and what does, DevOps is one of those terms that means a
 lot of things to different people.
 You helped write the book on Continuous Delivery, which
 helped lead into kind of what we call
 DevOps.
 Can you tell us a little bit about what that means to you,
 and how that relates to your
 talk today?
 Yeah, so, I mean, which is a very big question, and debate
 rages on how to define DevOps and
 what DevOps really is, but for me, ultimately, DevOps is
 about creating a culture in which
 we’re always learning how to get better at creating, and
 evolving, and operating great
 products and services.
 With a particular focus on…
 …collaboration between all the different people involved
 in doing that, whether that’s
 the engineers, the UX people, the operations people, and
 all the various groups who are
 involved in doing that.
 So it isn’t just about deploying. It’s about the whole
 application cycle, from code writing
 to delivery.
 Yeah, and, you know, even outside that cycle, I mean, the
 point of Continuous Delivery is
 to give you this capability to be able to get changes out
 fast to users in a low-risk way,
 and to make it…
 …economic to work in small batches, but once you have
 that capability, the question
 then becomes, “What do you do with it?”
 And I think, you know, the people in the DevOps field will
 tell you that you use that for
 creating a feedback loop so that you can make sure that you
‘re working on the right things,
 so that you’re building things that actually delight users
 and improve the customer experience.
 And so it kind of feeds into that whole discussion around
 building things that are delightful
 and better serve our customers.
 Right, and is that what your goal of your talk was today?
 Actually, what was the title of the talk?
 The title of the talk…
 It was a long one.
 It was.
 You have a lot of very long titles.
 I do, yeah.
 Sorry about that.
 So, yeah, “DevOps: Culture and Practices to Create Flow.”
 “DevOps: Culture and Practices to Create Flow,” and flow
 being…
 Flow being being able to get ideas out to users as quickly
 as possible, so I mean,
 the question of the thing that is actually doing the
 flowing was kind of the premise
 for the talk, right?
 Because I go back to the Toyota production system, and the
 idea of flow in the context
 of the Toyota production system is the customer puts in an
 order, “I want this car.
 How fast can you get it to them?”
 Right.
 So there’s this kind of idealized concept of one-piece flow
 of being able to go from
 customer order all the way through to delivering the
 vehicle as a single piece of flow with
 no kind of interruptions and cues or anything like that,
 which is unachievable, but the idea
 is that you’re always moving towards that.
 And so the idea is, what’s the equivalent of that in the
 context of software development?
 And so my contention is that what you should be looking at
 is check-ins, creating builds,
 and trying to get those builds out to users as fast and as
 safely as possible.
 And how do you actually do that?
 Okay.
 And some people, that is, even at the very beginning of how
 to write software is a controversial
 topic right now with TDD.
 Right.
 You know, is TDD that?
 Right.
 It’s not how to write software, much less how to finally
 get something to that end-user.
 Is that something you’ve been experienced or having
 conversations about, like trying
 to figure out those kind of things with your teams?
 Yeah.
 Absolutely.
 I mean, one of the things that, again, I said in the talk
 and I also say in the book and
 to anyone who’ll listen to me, frankly, is that you’ve got
 to build quality into the
 product.
 So the idea that you can somehow write some code and then
 there’s like quality activity
 a bit further down where you find out if it’s any good,
 that doesn’t work, or you have like
 a separate quality team.
 It’s the responsibility of the people building the software
 to build quality in.
 And one of the ways that you do that is through TDD, by
 making sure the developers are responsible
 for writing the tests that show that their software does
 what users want and what they
 expect of it.
 I mean, TDD is a whole other topic in its own right, and
 you know, one of the things
 for me about TDD is, you know, going back to the idea of
 satisfying the user, what we
 do in TDD is we put ourselves, it forces us to put
 ourselves in the perspective of the
 user of the software.
 Right.
 The first thing you do when you write a test is, you know,
 when you’re starting TDD
 for a new module or component or class or function, you
 think about what’s the API?
 Because you have to write the test against an API that
 doesn’t exist yet.
 Right.
 So you’re designing the API which puts you in the
 perspective of the user.
 Yeah.
 And that for me is a really important part of TDD, it
 forces developers to think as a
 consumer of the software they’re about to build.
 Right.
 And design an API that’s simple to use and simple to test.
 Yeah, you get that pain early that, like, whoa, what comes
 here?
 Right.
 And actually, once you’ve worked out the right test to
 write, actually writing the code that
 implements that should be relatively easy.
 The hard bit is working out what the test should look like.
 Right.
 And so that, I think, actually is very, you know, there’s a
 very lean aspect of that.
 And just, you know, jumping straight over into, you alluded
 to a book that you’re working
 on.
 Is that also in the same vein of topic or is this, what is
 the book?
 So, the book is called Lean Enterprise, and the book is
 about how large companies can
 innovate at scale.
 Okay.
 And so, excuse me, pardon me, the problem that we have with
 the continuous delivery
 book is we talk about the technical practices and the
 principles behind them, but organizations
 have trouble implementing it.
 And we see it time and time again, people say, “Oh, we’d
 love to do this, but we can’t because
 of, oh, excuse me again, we can’t because of our
 architecture or because of governance
 or because of compliance or because of our budgeting
 process.”
 And so, the book tries to address the whole ecosystem of
 innovation.
 How do you build and grow a company that can innovate at
 scale?
 You know, big companies who don’t treat IT as a competitive
 advantage find it very hard.
 I mean, IT ends up being a critical path.
 Right.
 There’s no investment in it.
 It’s treated as an, you know, an order to-
 A cost center.
 Yeah, a cost center, an order-taking function.
 And then, you know, it takes ages to get anything done
 because it has to follow all these rules.
 Imagine if your software actually was a competitive
 advantage to your business, how would you
 do things differently?
 And of course, there are companies who do do that, you know
, Netflix and Google and
 all these other kinds of companies that are doing this
 stuff at scale actually treat software
 as part of their product development process.
 And it’s central to how they innovate and it’s kind of
 exploring how enterprises can
 adopt that culture.
 And I can see how some of this, all of these things can be
 daunting for somebody who’s
 adopting them because even these terms, lean, flow, now I’m
 forgetting the other one, but
 they have multiple meanings in different contexts, like
 when you described flow, my first earlier,
 when you described flow.
 I was thinking about developer flow and then you’re talking
 about product flow and it’s,
 is it been something that’s been a challenge making sure
 that people understand these terms
 that have been used in different contexts, that they
 understand the context of what you’re
 talking about?
 Yeah, I mean, it’s a huge problem, even understanding the
 concepts and understanding
 the names and then understanding how they fit together and,
 you know, people make basic
 mistakes with this.
 You know, again, it’s not because they’re stupid, it’s
 because it’s genuinely difficult
 and counterintuitive.
 And a lot of people think that lean is about cutting costs.
 Lean is not about cutting costs.
 Lean is about reducing waste and by reducing waste, we end
 up with lower costs, but you
 don’t just go about looking for expensive things and cut
 them out of the budget.
 Right, right.
 But people do that.
 People are like, well, we’re going to go lean.
 That means we’re going to reduce our head count and we’ll
 actually know that’s not the
 case.
 And again, if you look at Toyota, I mean, in Japanese
 culture until quite recently,
 everybody had a job for life, so you could never fire
 anyone.
 So the idea with lean was that you would increase
 productivity by, you know, making people more
 efficient at what they did and more effective at what they
 did.
 And that frees up people to work on higher value things
 instead.
 And what they would do is they would use the efficiency
 gains they got through applying
 the principles to drive the growth of the company.
 Because those people who were doing all this low level
 stuff are now freed up to do high
 level stuff.
 And now we can do more stuff.
 And so that means we can expand our market or introduce new
 products, you know, it gives
 you the power to do all these additional things.
 Whereas a lot of people adopting lean, they think it’s
 about, you know, making people
 redundant and firing them so we can reduce costs.
 Right.
 No, absolutely not.
 That’s totally not the point.
 But you know, this is just one of many misconceptions and
 it’s very counterintuitive.
 And it’s, and it’s even, this is a word that has come up in
 a lot of interviews is empathy.
 You know, trying to put your mind into the listener’s mind.
 And, and that’s, that’s always a trick, you know, here we
‘re doing these interviews is
 trying to, to take what are my own biases, like when I hear
 lean, I’m a developer.
 So I’m thinking, I mean, I’ll flow, I’m thinking developer
 flow.
 So when you’re, when you’re at these presentations, do you
 often get people that are, or when
 you’re talking these topics, do you often get people
 surprised or pushed back or expecting
 something different and, and have to be brought back into
 the fold or.
 Yeah.
 I mean, a lot of the time, I mean, because, you know,
 people come up and they, you know,
 they expect me also to be a continuous delivery guy.
 We need to be talking about these very technical things.
 And I found that the technical stuff is not the problem.
 The problem is leadership and culture.
 And so I tend to talk about those things these days.
 And, you know, I’ve been doing a bunch of research in my
 book.
 So what comes out in my talks is basically a lot of the
 research I’ve been doing from
 the book and, and, and talking about that stuff.
 And that’s not what people often expect to talk about.
 Um, but in my experience is the most important stuff.
 So yeah, I mean, I kind of hope that people will come and
 be excited by some of this stuff
 and be inspired.
 I mean, the most I can hope is that people come away with a
 bunch of ideas for things
 they can try out.
 That’s what I really hope, but you know, people are not
 necessarily going to get what they
 come for.
 Um, and, uh, yeah, so one of the things I want to do is say
, sorry to the people that
 didn’t get what they were expecting out in the talks.
 Maybe they got something that they can use.
 What do they say?
 You didn’t get what you asked for, but you got what you
 needed.
 Right.
 Hopefully, hopefully.
 Well, and then just to, to segue straight into your
 conference that you’re working on,
 um, FlowConf, it’s obviously something that’s related to
 this topic, but what is it?
 Where is it?
 Okay.
 So this year it’s, uh, the week of Labor Day, uh, 3rd of
 September and 4th of September
 in San Francisco.
 Uh, you go to flowcon.org, flowcon.org and, uh, my fabulous
 British accent.
 Okay.
 With a W.
 Yes.
 F-L-O-W-C-O-N.org.
 Um, and the idea of the conference is to explore the whole
 range of stuff that goes into building
 great products and services.
 So we talk about UX, we talk about product development, we
 talk about, you know, deep
 dive on technical topics, talk about culture and we talk
 about all those things.
 And the idea is to emphasize the fact, A, that it’s a cross
-functional activity.
 So, you know, we don’t have a developer track and a UX
 track.
 And, uh, abstract, because that kind of goes against the
 whole principle, which is that
 we all have to work together and we explore all the
 different aspects that go into creating
 great products.
 Yeah.
 The developers need to know more about the business,
 business or the needs and empathy,
 have more empathy with what the business needs and the
 business needs to understand what
 they’re asking.
 So everybody needs to kind of get empathy.
 Yeah, exactly.
 No, and that’s absolutely right, I mean, my personal
 experience, I, I wanted to design
 a conference that reflects our industry as I want it to
 look, not as it looks right now.
 And I also kind of wanted to think about, you know, what
 makes a great conference.
 When I go to a conference, I often will attend topics that
 I don’t know very much about so
 that I can just get my mind blown.
 Right.
 Um, I really enjoy that experience.
 So I kind of wanted to go to a conference where you could
 see a bunch of things that
 were related to what you do, but not directly related, so
 tangentially related and get an
 idea of how all this stuff fits together to create a bigger
 picture, because again, one
 of the things that I lean is, you know, you can’t just
 optimize your particular part.
 You’ve got to think about the whole and think about the
 high-level objectives of what you’re
 doing.
 So, you know, it’s important to think about all these other
 things and how they fit together
 and as you say, create empathy for all those different
 people and what they’re trying to
 do.
 So the conference is focused on that and on real stories of
 people doing real things,
 um, in difficult situations.
 September 3rd and 4th, San Francisco, flocon.org.
 Yeah, and if you register before May the 30th, there’s an
 early bird, so you get it cheap.
 Great.
 Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.
 Pleasure.
 Thanks so much for having me.
 Thanks.

    "transcript": "Hi it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2015 and I\n'm standing here with\n Mads Torgersen who talked about the future of C#. Thank you\n very much for\n taking the time to speak with me. So the future of C#, what\n is what's in a\n crystal ball? Well they're a bundle of things that are in\n the very near future\n of C#, which means we release in a couple of months. We\n just put out a\n release candidate for it. One being several language\n features for C#\n itself, which are all sort of in the category of helping\n clean up the code\n and remove boilerplate and so on. Pretty lightweight\n features, if you will, but\n should make everybody's code look nicer. The signatures of\n funk and types and T\n are gonna go away? Well some things are, a lot of member\n declarations will get\n shorter. We'll have shorthands for what we call the null\n conditional operator\n where lots more null checks become implicit. We have, you\n know, various\n little features that just make your code safer and nicer in\n various ways.\n Lots of little features. And that's kind of not the most\n exciting thing\n that's happening with C# actually. The main thing I think\n is that\n we're sort of almost putting out a new kind of tech, like\n sort of a language\n engine. We call it Project Roslyn. That is, at the core it\n's a compiler, so\n it's something that understands. It's the thing that we\n build our compiler with.\n It's also underlying the tooling experience in Visual\n Studio, so it's a\n very deep language understanding engine, if you will. It's\n both good at compiling\n with high throughput to, you know, to some executable, but\n it's also really good\n at being, sitting behind an ID and being reactive at a\n typing speed while answering\n all kinds of deep questions about the code. And it's also\n good at performing custom analysis\n that people write for it. And this is one of the things\n that I think is really exciting\n about it is that it provides a complete and efficient API\n on top of the whole language\n that people can write to. And they can write, you know,\n batch static analysis over it. That's\n very high fidelity. They can also write plug-ins that run\n in real time as you type and give\n you squiggles. Where they think, \"Oh, this is going to take\n a long time.\" So, you know,\n they can do that. Where they think that your code is wrong,\n offer suggestions for fixes\n that can be executed.\n So, lots of introspection type things.\n Sort of, you could call it compile time introspection. So,\n it's that, it's giving\n that ability to deeply understand the language. It's\n putting that in the hands of people who\n want to enhance the tool in a very easy fashion. And so, I\n think, you can, for instance, imagine\n people who write APIs and share them out, whether within a\n company or publicly or whatever.\n What you could do now is to ship analyzers with your API\n that will help them, you know,\n that will help people use the API in the right way. Saying,\n \"Don't call it like this. Call\n it like this or use it in this sequence.\" It can, you know,\n people can write very simple\n logic that discovers those patterns in people's code and\n give them real time feedback saying,\n \"Here's how you should rather do it. Click the light bulb\n and I'll fix it for you.\"\n So, like, instead of just comments about deprecations, it\n could be like, \"Oh, this method is old.\"\n And that could be something that could be surfaced through\n the IDE.\n Certainly. Any pattern, essentially, we have this hardened\n immutable object model of code\n that we present to whoever wants to take advantage of it,\n want to plug in and take advantage of\n it. And they can look for whatever pattern they want in the\n code. So, tactically, semantically,\n following the static bindings, they can ask about all those\n things of the compiler in\n real time as advanced as they want it to and give immediate\n feedback to the compiler. So,\n to the eventual user of the IDE who's using that plugin.\n Interesting.\n It's actually very, it's a very, it sort of opens a lot of\n doors for new tooling\n experiences, much more tailored tooling experiences,\n depending on your environment, depending on\n what libraries you use and so on, than people have had in\n the past.\n Interesting. And, you know, to kind of move over to some of\n the advancements in portability\n for the CLR, we're looking at the recent release of the\n Visual Code and, you know,\n in promotion of running .NET code on non-Microsoft servers.\n How does this play into the Roslyn\n story?\n Well, it does play very nicely together. First of all, the\n Roslyn source code is in\n C#.\n Right.\n So, the fact that C# runs, is going to run well on Linux\n and on Mac means that, well,\n the C# language engine is going to run well there. So, now\n we can support, people can\n use that engine to support IDE integration.\n Visual Studio Code, for instance, does make use of that,\n where the way that the language\n engine runs with the IDE is not actually running inside of\n the IDE, but is running as a separate\n process on your Linux box, for instance. It's a surface\n that runs on the box or anywhere\n else, but then the latency issues creep in.\n And then it just speaks a protocol, you know, through a\n pipe with the IDE and that's a thin,\n long integration layer in the IDE.\n Is that the OmniSharp?\n The OmniSharp, exactly.\n Okay, yeah.\n Yes. So, it uses OmniSharp for that integration. And OmniS\nharp is also, it's a great open project\n actually, with Microsoft participation, but driven by the\n community. It lets it easily\n integrate with a ton of different IDEs.\n Yeah, I've seen it for Vim, like hooking into OmniSharp\n with Vim and it kind of opens\n up.\n Right, it's a blind text and so on. There's a long list if\n you go to the website. So,\n enabling technology for all of that to happen.\n Interesting, yeah. And so, are you looking at other\n products, like Mono, who had been\n on non-dotnet runtimes? It's because of this now open Ros\nlyn project. Is there more communication\n with Mono?\n Absolutely. We have this formal entity now called the dot\nnet foundation, of which both\n Microsoft and Mono and many others are members. And these\n projects are undertaken under that\n foundation, if you will. So, essentially, you can think of\n dotnet on Linux and on Mac.\n You sort of think of them as the next version of Mono, if\n you will. The source code is primarily\n derived from the Microsoft source codes for Windows, but\n they are essentially the next\n version, being more robust and more tailored for sort of a\n modernâ€¦\n It brings me to even thinking about Office 365 and how it\n seemed like earlier resistance\n from the Office team to adopt dotnets, because they had\n their legacy code base with all the\n Win32 and C++ for optimized speed. But now, Office 365\n seems to be really getting some\n serious traction. And I'm presuming that's powered by ASP.\nNET.\n On Roslyn, are you working with some of these product teams\n internally to identify?\n There's not a specific connection between those two things.\n I think they're more expressive\n of a similar trend where we are happy to take our business\n to any platform.\n Well, I was just seeing more of how dotnet might be\n becoming more important to the overall\n strategy inside of Microsoft, and looking beyond the\n Microsoft desktop platform and\n saying, \"Okay, we have this tool inside that's\n doing this amazing stuff for ASP.NET. Let's shore that up\n and make it even stronger.\"\n I mean, is that even within any kind of strategy\n discussions you guys are working on?\n So the way to look at it is not so much that dotnet is the\n linchpin of everything we do\n to push into other platforms or to work in other places in\n the cloud or whatever. It's\n really just one of the things that we're opening up. We've\n stopped thinking about\n Windows as the only platform for things, and that goes\n across the board. Sometimes\n dotnet is enabling technology for that, and sometimes it's\n something else. Some things\n work at the JavaScript level, cross-platform. Some things\n are actually, there's a ton of\n C++ code that gets ported that's a little harder to get to\n work cross-platform, but\n it's not impossible. And so it's not that dotnet is sort of\n like\n the thing that we're shoving everything through or building\n everything on as we kind of expand\n into new places.\n Well, yeah, because I remember when dotnet came out and the\n original marketing push was\n that dotnet is the future, and then it seemed like there\n was kind of a winnowing of, like,\n okay, dotnet really is just for server stuff, but now it\n seems like, okay, now we're going\n to expand what dotnet can be used for.\n Yeah, I don't think we ever, like, thought, we didn't think\n of dotnet as only for server\n stuff. I think it just, it's just one of those technology\n choices. If you're looking at efficiency,\n systems-level efficiency, you're going to pick C++. It's\n still going to be faster than\n dotnet or Java or whatever. If you're looking at the reach\n that you can get on the web,\n for instance, well, you'll pick JavaScript, even though you\n don't have the same productivity\n and performance that you do in C#. For that vast space in\n the middle, C# is a really good\n choice. And that's regardless of whether it's in the cloud\n or on on-prem servers or whether\n it's a client app. Like, if you look at our own...\n App ecosystem, most things are written in C# on Windows.\n And we don't have a Microsoft\n offering. Microsoft, or Samurai is our close partner in\n offering C#-based development on\n other client platforms. So you can kind of pretty much take\n it in any direction you want.\n I don't think we ever thought of it as not being for the\n whole range of clients, from\n client to server. It was more that we kind of focused all\n that energy in the Windows\n space only.\n Yeah. Well, personally, as a developer, I developed on\n Microsoft platforms for a decade\n and moved to Ruby on Rails. But now what I've seen, I was\n one of the people that was tweeting,\n \"Wow,\" when Visual Studio and Visual Code came out. And it\n's kind of exciting to look\n at ways to be able to take those old skills and apply them\n in a broad space.\n It's an exciting time to be working at Microsoft as well,\n because we really have opened up\n a lot. And we're...\n Not only becoming available on a much broader range of\n platforms, we're also doing it much\n more in the open. The open sourcing has been really\n exciting. The direct contact with the\n user community, the contributions that we get through that,\n both in terms of proposals\n and discussions and down to code contributions on our .NET\n Core CLR and framework there,\n and to Roslyn itself, the compiler engine, if you will.\n That's just staggering and amazing.\n Yeah. It's really great.\n It's very cool. Even from the outside, it's really cool to\n see that those changes\n taking place. Well, thank you very much for taking the time\n to speak with me.\n Thanks. That's great.\n Appreciate it. Thank you.",

 Lots of little features. And that’s kind of not the most

 that’s happening with C# actually. The main thing I think
 is that
 we’re sort of almost putting out a new kind of tech, like
 sort of a language

 So, lots of introspection type things.
 Sort of, you could call it compile time introspection. So,
 it’s that, it’s giving
 that ability to deeply understand the language. It’s
 putting that in the hands of people who
 want to enhance the tool in a very easy fashion. And so, I

 Well, it does play very nicely together. First of all, the
 Roslyn source code is in
 C#.
 Right.
 So, the fact that C# runs, is going to run well on Linux
 and on Mac means that, well,
 the C# language engine is going to run well there. So, now
 we can support, people can
 use that engine to support IDE integration.
 Visual Studio Code, for instance, does make use of that,
 where the way that the language
 engine runs with the IDE is not actually running inside of
 the IDE, but is running as a separate
 process on your Linux box, for instance. It’s a surface
 that runs on the box or anywhere
 else, but then the latency issues creep in.
 And then it just speaks a protocol, you know, through a
 pipe with the IDE and that’s a thin,
 long integration layer in the IDE.
 Is that the OmniSharp?
 The OmniSharp, exactly.
 Okay, yeah.
 Yes. So, it uses OmniSharp for that integration. And OmniS
harp is also, it’s a great open project
 actually, with Microsoft participation, but driven by the
 community. It lets it easily
 integrate with a ton of different IDEs.
 Yeah, I’ve seen it for Vim, like hooking into OmniSharp
 with Vim and it kind of opens
 up.
 Right, it’s a blind text and so on. There’s a long list if
 you go to the website. So,
 enabling technology for all of that to happen.
 Interesting, yeah. And so, are you looking at other
 products, like Mono, who had been
 on non-dotnet runtimes? It’s because of this now open Ros
lyn project. Is there more communication
 with Mono?
 Absolutely. We have this formal entity now called the dot
net foundation, of which both
 Microsoft and Mono and many others are members. And these
 projects are undertaken under that
 foundation, if you will. So, essentially, you can think of
 dotnet on Linux and on Mac.
 You sort of think of them as the next version of Mono, if
 you will. The source code is primarily
 derived from the Microsoft source codes for Windows, but
 they are essentially the next
 version, being more robust and more tailored for sort of a
 modernâ€¦
 It brings me to even thinking about Office 365 and how it
 seemed like earlier resistance
 from the Office team to adopt dotnets, because they had
 their legacy code base with all the
 Win32 and C++ for optimized speed. But now, Office 365
 seems to be really getting some
 serious traction. And I’m presuming that’s powered by ASP.
NET.
 On Roslyn, are you working with some of these product teams
 internally to identify?
 There’s not a specific connection between those two things.
 I think they’re more expressive
 of a similar trend where we are happy to take our business
 to any platform.
 Well, I was just seeing more of how dotnet might be
 becoming more important to the overall
 strategy inside of Microsoft, and looking beyond the
 Microsoft desktop platform and
 saying, “Okay, we have this tool inside that’s
 doing this amazing stuff for ASP.NET. Let’s shore that up
 and make it even stronger.”
 I mean, is that even within any kind of strategy
 discussions you guys are working on?
 So the way to look at it is not so much that dotnet is the
 linchpin of everything we do
 to push into other platforms or to work in other places in
 the cloud or whatever. It’s
 really just one of the things that we’re opening up. We’ve
 stopped thinking about
 Windows as the only platform for things, and that goes
 across the board. Sometimes
 dotnet is enabling technology for that, and sometimes it’s
 something else. Some things
 work at the JavaScript level, cross-platform. Some things
 are actually, there’s a ton of
 C++ code that gets ported that’s a little harder to get to
 work cross-platform, but
 it’s not impossible. And so it’s not that dotnet is sort of
 like
 the thing that we’re shoving everything through or building
 everything on as we kind of expand
 into new places.
 Well, yeah, because I remember when dotnet came out and the
 original marketing push was
 that dotnet is the future, and then it seemed like there
 was kind of a winnowing of, like,
 okay, dotnet really is just for server stuff, but now it
 seems like, okay, now we’re going
 to expand what dotnet can be used for.
 Yeah, I don’t think we ever, like, thought, we didn’t think
 of dotnet as only for server
 stuff. I think it just, it’s just one of those technology
 choices. If you’re looking at efficiency,
 systems-level efficiency, you’re going to pick C++. It’s
 still going to be faster than
 dotnet or Java or whatever. If you’re looking at the reach
 that you can get on the web,
 for instance, well, you’ll pick JavaScript, even though you
 don’t have the same productivity
 and performance that you do in C#. For that vast space in
 the middle, C# is a really good
 choice. And that’s regardless of whether it’s in the cloud
 or on on-prem servers or whether
 it’s a client app. Like, if you look at our own…
 App ecosystem, most things are written in C# on Windows.
 And we don’t have a Microsoft
 offering. Microsoft, or Samurai is our close partner in
 offering C#-based development on
 other client platforms. So you can kind of pretty much take
 it in any direction you want.
 I don’t think we ever thought of it as not being for the
 whole range of clients, from
 client to server. It was more that we kind of focused all
 that energy in the Windows
 space only.
 Yeah. Well, personally, as a developer, I developed on
 Microsoft platforms for a decade
 and moved to Ruby on Rails. But now what I’ve seen, I was
 one of the people that was tweeting,
 “Wow,” when Visual Studio and Visual Code came out. And it
‘s kind of exciting to look
 at ways to be able to take those old skills and apply them
 in a broad space.
 It’s an exciting time to be working at Microsoft as well,
 because we really have opened up
 a lot. And we’re…
 Not only becoming available on a much broader range of
 platforms, we’re also doing it much
 more in the open. The open sourcing has been really
 exciting. The direct contact with the
 user community, the contributions that we get through that,
 both in terms of proposals
 and discussions and down to code contributions on our .NET
 Core CLR and framework there,
 and to Roslyn itself, the compiler engine, if you will.
 That’s just staggering and amazing.
 Yeah. It’s really great.
 It’s very cool. Even from the outside, it’s really cool to
 see that those changes
 taking place. Well, thank you very much for taking the time
 to speak with me.
 Thanks. That’s great.
 Appreciate it. Thank you.</p>

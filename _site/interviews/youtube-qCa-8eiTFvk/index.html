    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2015. I'm\n sitting here with\n Jerry Cattell, who is one of the organizers with the\n Chicago DevOps Group.\n Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.\n So Chicago DevOps,\n how did you get involved in that? And what is the DevOps\n group?\n Sure, I mean DevOps in general, at least I mean you can ask\n anyone, they'll have\n different definitions. For me it's generally about sort of\n breaking down\n silos and getting everyone in the company to sort of\n alignment and trying\n to achieve the same goals instead of development and\n operations sort of\n fighting each other historically. So yeah, I've been\n involved with the\n organization for I guess about three years now. Okay, so it\n's been around a little while.\n Yeah, it's actually been around probably for five years or\n so. Okay. It was\n registered with the actual meetup.com/devops. It was the\n first one.\n Yeah, that's a coveted title.\n Yeah.\n Yeah, so Martin Logan registered that long ago and yeah, he\n was the original\n creator of it. And yeah, it's, I basically got involved\n because I've always sort of\n straddled the line between development and operations and\n database\n administration. So for me it was just finally finding a\n place that I kind of\n belonged. But in general, I think it's a lot more about\n just improving the whole\n process of developing software at a company and stream\nlining that.\n And you mentioned that, you know, the group's been around\n longer than you've been a part of.\n So, and now you're an organizer, you know, so what brought\n you to the group?\n And then what kind of encouraged you to want to invest time\n into helping run the\n group? Sure. I mean, well, I went to a couple of them\n before, but like it just\n as an attendee to the meetups and always thought it was\n very interesting. Then\n Martin left to go to Seattle. Yeah. Leaving sort of a void.\n And so I had\n missed the talks on those subjects. And then so I thought,\n well, I might as well\n see if I can help on that. And yeah, I mean, I basically\n decided to put in the\n time just because I think it's a great group of people that\n attend the meetups\n and I tend to learn a ton just from hearing how they're\n solving their\n problems. Like any meetup group, I mean, you just want to\n understand, you know, how do\n you solve this problem that I'm having at work right now.\n What are you doing? And also, I mean, because as the\n organizer, part of your job is to find good speakers and\n stuff. And so a lot of\n that has been just sort of me being able to reach out\n beyond our community and\n actually start to talk to people that I would have never\n introduced myself to\n just, you know, at a crowd or a conference. I might not\n have talked to them in the\n past, but now as the organizer, I'm like, okay, now I\n actually have a reason.\n That's an excellent point. And that's actually one of the\n things that I've\n discovered as with UGtastic is you have a reason to go up\n to people that\n you're like, oh, I went to a conference and somebody gave a\n presentation. Okay,\n great. And then you just go off and do your business. But\n if you're a user\n group organizer, now you have, you know, a reason. Like,\n hey, would you come to our\n group? Yeah, it's like, I really enjoyed your talk and I'd\n love for you to give\n that talk to like the local community now. Right, right.\n From wherever I might\n be seeing them talk. And yeah, it's a, so that's been one\n of the huge benefits\n of being an organizer is just meeting all these amazing\n people. Yeah, it's open\n doors. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And speaking of other\n community events, you\n mentioned there's this DevOps Day, which you got the shirt\n on for. What is\n DevOps Days? So DevOps Days, it's been around for about\n five, almost six years\n now. Yeah. The first one took place in Ghent in 2009 and\n that was just sort of\n the start of it all. It's now been, I think, over 50 events\n worldwide. Chicago\n first held DevOps Days, they had their first DevOps Days\n last year. Okay. And so\n we're doing it all again this year in August 25th and 26th.\n So yeah, so it's...\n Is it a multi-day conference? Yeah, it's a two-day\n conference. It's got presentations,\n it's got Ignite talks, it's got open spaces. So it's like a\n good mix of lots\n of things. It's a much more participatory conference than\n the standard one\n where you just sort of go and listen to someone talk. It's\n much more about actually\n voicing the things you care about and actually talking to\n each other. Yeah. It's\n not the lecture style. No, not at all. So it's definitely a\n great conference that I\n love going to. And so when we finally got one here in\n Chicago, we were thrilled and\n then we had a great response last year, so we decided to do\n it again this year. So if\n I just Google DevOps Days? DevOpsDays.org will get you to\n the main website and from\n all our stuff. And right now, actually, our call for\n proposals is open, so anyone\n who wants to do that. Okay, so DevOps Days and then it's,\n you said it runs in\n several cities and different states at different times?\n Yeah, I mean, Austin was\n just last week. I think Toronto was actually this week. Oh,\n so it's all over the\n place. Yeah, and like I know Minneapolis is in July. We're\n in August. Yeah, and\n they're just great events to go to. Okay, great. Well,\n thank you very much for\n taking the time to speak with me. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n Subtitles by the Amara.org community",

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015. I’m
 sitting here with
 Jerry Cattell, who is one of the organizers with the
 Chicago DevOps Group.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
 So Chicago DevOps,
 how did you get involved in that? And what is the DevOps
 group?
 Sure, I mean DevOps in general, at least I mean you can ask
 anyone, they’ll have
 different definitions. For me it’s generally about sort of
 breaking down
 silos and getting everyone in the company to sort of
 alignment and trying
 to achieve the same goals instead of development and
 operations sort of
 fighting each other historically. So yeah, I’ve been
 involved with the
 organization for I guess about three years now. Okay, so it
‘s been around a little while.
 Yeah, it’s actually been around probably for five years or
 so. Okay. It was
 registered with the actual meetup.com/devops. It was the
 first one.
 Yeah, that’s a coveted title.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, so Martin Logan registered that long ago and yeah, he
 was the original
 creator of it. And yeah, it’s, I basically got involved
 because I’ve always sort of
 straddled the line between development and operations and
 database
 administration. So for me it was just finally finding a
 place that I kind of
 belonged. But in general, I think it’s a lot more about
 just improving the whole
 process of developing software at a company and stream
lining that.
 And you mentioned that, you know, the group’s been around
 longer than you’ve been a part of.
 So, and now you’re an organizer, you know, so what brought
 you to the group?
 And then what kind of encouraged you to want to invest time
 into helping run the
 group? Sure. I mean, well, I went to a couple of them
 before, but like it just
 as an attendee to the meetups and always thought it was
 very interesting. Then
 Martin left to go to Seattle. Yeah. Leaving sort of a void.
 And so I had
 missed the talks on those subjects. And then so I thought,
 well, I might as well
 see if I can help on that. And yeah, I mean, I basically
 decided to put in the
 time just because I think it’s a great group of people that
 attend the meetups
 and I tend to learn a ton just from hearing how they’re
 solving their
 problems. Like any meetup group, I mean, you just want to
 understand, you know, how do
 you solve this problem that I’m having at work right now.
 What are you doing? And also, I mean, because as the
 organizer, part of your job is to find good speakers and
 stuff. And so a lot of
 that has been just sort of me being able to reach out
 beyond our community and
 actually start to talk to people that I would have never
 introduced myself to
 just, you know, at a crowd or a conference. I might not
 have talked to them in the
 past, but now as the organizer, I’m like, okay, now I

 That’s an excellent point. And that’s actually one of the

 if you’re a user
 group organizer, now you have, you know, a reason. Like,
 hey, would you come to our
 group? Yeah, it’s like, I really enjoyed your talk and I’d

 that talk to like the local community now. Right, right.
 From wherever I might

 it’s got Ignite talks, it’s got open spaces. So it’s like a

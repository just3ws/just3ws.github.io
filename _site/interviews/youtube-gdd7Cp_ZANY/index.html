    "transcript": "Hi it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here again at GOTO Conf\n 2014 and I'm\n standing here with Adrian Colcroft who gave the keynote,\n the kickoff talk here\n at the conference. Thank you very much for taking the time\n to speak with me.\n Can you tell me a little bit about what your talk was about\n and and how you came\n to give that talk here at GOTO Conf? Sure, thanks for having\n me on this. The talk\n really came from, there's two pieces to it. The first part\n was about how to speed\n things up and the speed of innovation being very important\n and how to think\n about what is innovation and what is disruptive rather than\n what is kind of\n the incumbent sort of existing companies and the way they\n do things. And so\n there's this\n phrase that I kind of hinged it around which is, \"It ain't\n what you know that\n messes you up, it's what you know that ain't so.\" It's a\n Will Rogers quote and a\n lot of the disruptions that happen in this\n industry happen because an incumbent figures out, \"Okay, we\n're gonna, we have an\n idea, we're gonna, we know how to optimize for that idea.\"\n You build a business\n model around it and then you go off and build your business\n. And then somebody else noticed\n this is that one of your assumptions is no longer true. And\n you're optimizing for\n something that used to be really expensive but now it isn't\n. And then\n you, the disruptor basically takes advantage of this thing\n that\n everyone else assumes is a big expensive hard-to-do thing\n that has now\n become cheap and easy. So you end up wasting a lot of\n something and it looks\n horrifying to the incumbents, right? So they couldn't\n possibly do that, you know.\n But you end up disrupting the industries that way and there\n's a number of examples that\n of that that I went through. Yeah, because the first thing\n I think about is\n is data databases, you know, that we have Oracle and MS SQL\n that they're\n Microsoft, they have these big monolithic products. But\n then along comes open\n source products like MySQL and Postgres which are now\n running huge operations.\n And before, I mean, they're still incredibly intensely\n difficult problems they're solving,\n but they're able to take and disrupt the business of Post\ngre, I mean, of Oracle.\n So yeah, so really the open source itself is one of those,\n the concept of open\n source, the concept that the best software you could buy is\n the stuff you\n get for free that's built by a community is something that\n is sort of alien to\n the traditional enterprise software businesses where you\n have a\n product manager who comes up with an idea and then they go\n away and work on\n it for a few years and then they pop out with the product\n and try and sell it\n to you for a lot of money. And historically that was how\n you bought\n stuff because it was the best stuff you could get and these\n companies knew\n were the places that knew best how to build things. And I\n worked for Sun\n Microsystems for a long time and, you know, part of that\n process. But what\n really happened was the best things you can get now are\n free and they are built\n by communities and the best engineers don't work at those\n enterprise\n companies, they work for end users. So, you know, the most\n interesting scale\n available reliable software now is coming from open source\n projects and I\n highlighted a few of those in the talk. So that's one\n disruption. Another one I\n mentioned was solid-state disk replacing spinning raster to\n traditional\n disks and that the way that that has completely taken what\n used to be a it's\n a multi-trillion dollar business or whatever it is in\n storage and if you\n look at the way that a Cassandra based deployment on AWS is\n there are no storage admin\n there's no SAN, there's some SSD inside an instance and\n that's all there is. So\n the person managing it is probably a Java distributed\n systems programmer,\n developer type of person with a little bit of operational\n experience to\n automate how to keep that thing up and running. But there's\n no layers and\n layers of SAN fabrics and storage arrays have completely\n disappeared so\n it's not just that you disrupt the product, you make the\n entire product\n category disappear. That's one of the most disruptive\n things that's going on right now.\n I have to think about when you're talking about trying to\n change the\n mindset of people who've built their own business, their\n entire business on a\n certain set of assumptions and looking at more about just a\n human quirk there.\n I'm just reading an article about how people who have\n deeply held beliefs that\n they've internalized into their own persona, their own\n personality, and\n that's the only way to get them to change their thoughts.\n You can't just say\n here's a fact that you what you know is wrong. You have to\n just change literally\n the way they think and address their personality. Is that\n something that\n when you think about when we're dealing with these\n companies that have\n these deeply embedded, entrenched I should say, not\n embedded, but deeply\n entrenched processes like this is how we build software\n because this is how\n things are done, this is how we develop products, and how\n we can apply\n them. Do you talk about a little bit how we can approach\n those\n kind of thought processes and address them and work within\n them?\n Sure, so I talked about a few other things. I had a whole\n hour, so\n there was a lot of things I covered. One of them was\n continuous\n delivery as another way of disruptively speeding things up.\n The\n assumption you're making there is that you can move a lot\n quicker, but\n what it really comes down to is the\n DevOps kind of approach where you're actually taking away\n the handoffs\n between teams. So everyone knows that developers have to\n stay in\n development and operations people run their code and they\n're different kinds\n of people and they optimize for different things. But if\n you reorganize\n so that you put them in the same organization, you blend\n those\n responsibilities and you automate everything. It's not just\n that you create\n a DevOps team, it's that you actually have to reorganize\n your company and have a cultural change.\n So DevOps is in many ways a cultural problem and companies\n that get over that\n are the ones that are doing well. So somebody tweeted a few\n days ago, \"Is DevOps\n ready for the enterprise?\" That was a question. My response\n was it's the other\n way around. The enterprises that are ready for DevOps are\n the ones that are\n going to disrupt the enterprises that aren't.\n Oh okay, so they're going to just knock out the ones that\n aren't.\n Yeah, it's much harder to compare.\n If you're running, if every time you do a product release\n it takes you a year\n to get it to customers and your competitors doing it in a\n few weeks and\n learning and you're being able to run rings around you. So\n that is the sort of\n existential challenge that a lot of companies are getting\n through right\n now. And the other big change is that software used to be a\n little thing on\n the side for a lot of companies and now it's central. It's\n central to everything\n they do. It's central to the way they do marketing and\n sales and build things and\n the way they support customers and the way they deliver\n products. Internet of\n Things is just one aspect of that. But what you're seeing\n is this whole\n software eats the world, driving people. And now it's\n central, they have to get\n good at it. And so they're looking to the big enterprise\n companies, the big web\n companies as examples of how to do that. Netflix is one\n example. It's a very, very\n rapid development process. Google, Twitter, Facebook, all\n of those companies are\n leading in this space.\n And the enterprises around the world are trying to figure\n out, how do we learn,\n what do we learn from them and how do we adopt it?\n Yeah, oh sorry, go ahead. So that was kind of the first\n part of the talk. The second\n part was some more practical things about what that\n actually means in\n practice for a developer. There's some techniques and I was\n trying to\n make it a little bit more hands-on and a bit more detailed.\n So the talk was kind\n of a little in two sections.\n Yeah, the reason that what I was about to say is that I\n interviewed Bill Scott,\n who's with PayPal, and he talked about how it was fresh off\n of the acquisition\n of Braintree and how PayPal is trying to rethink their\n entire business process.\n And they were looking at companies like Braintree who were\n able to deliver\n these things. And a lot of people in the press that I heard\n were looking very\n skeptically on PayPal acquiring Braintrust, thinking, \"Okay\n, well I'm\n Braintree, well that's going to bust the Braintrust at Bra\nintree.\" That's what I thought.\n Say that 10 times. But when he described it, they said, \"No\n, we're looking at how\n they do things and really trying to figure out how to bring\n those into our\n operations, in a nutshell.\"\n Sure. I worked with Bill Scott when he was at Netflix and I\n actually worked at eBay, PayPal, back before I joined\n Netflix.\n So I get some of the challenges there. You've got a\n successful business and\n it's working and then you have to, you know, PayPal has\n this big challenge from other\n financial processing stuff like Square and Stripe and\n whatever. Those companies\n are, you know, we're more agile and PayPal's trying to\n respond to that. And\n they're doing a pretty good job and what Bill's doing there\n is good work to\n move them strongly in that direction. It's good to see. If\n you were to go and\n just flip a bit and everybody's head was in your talk and\n have them take\n home at least one factoid or one idea, what would you like\n to have impressed\n upon them the most?\n I think from sort of questioning the assumptions you've got\n, right? Look at\n the way you're operating, what you're doing and what\n assumptions you're\n making. And if you're assuming something and optimizing for\n it and then you look\n at the trend for that thing and, you know, it's either\n going to suddenly stop being\n true or over time it's going to stop being true, make those\n explicit and get out ahead of those\n examples. One of the key things that Netflix does, it tries\n to lean into\n the future. If there's a trend towards cloud, they'll get\n in early and they'll\n dive in and they'll learn how to get good at it before it's\n really ready for\n mass consumption. And that is a very powerful technique for\n learning how to\n take full advantage. So once it becomes mass adoption, you\n're already well\n optimized for it, so you have that advantage.\n Okay, well thank you very much for taking the time to speak\n with me. I appreciate it.\n User groups with lots to say, interviews and more. No way!\n Sharing great ideas in\n the tech community.

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here again at GOTO Conf
 2014 and I’m
 standing here with Adrian Colcroft who gave the keynote,
 the kickoff talk here
 at the conference. Thank you very much for taking the time
 to speak with me.
 Can you tell me a little bit about what your talk was about
 and and how you came
 to give that talk here at GOTO Conf? Sure, thanks for having
 me on this. The talk
 really came from, there’s two pieces to it. The first part
 was about how to speed
 things up and the speed of innovation being very important
 and how to think
 about what is innovation and what is disruptive rather than
 what is kind of
 the incumbent sort of existing companies and the way they
 do things. And so
 there’s this
 phrase that I kind of hinged it around which is, “It ain’t
 what you know that
 messes you up, it’s what you know that ain’t so.” It’s a
 Will Rogers quote and a
 lot of the disruptions that happen in this
 industry happen because an incumbent figures out, “Okay, we
‘re gonna, we have an
 idea, we’re gonna, we know how to optimize for that idea.”
 You build a business
 model around it and then you go off and build your business
. And then somebody else noticed
 this is that one of your assumptions is no longer true. And
 you’re optimizing for
 something that used to be really expensive but now it isn’t
. And then
 you, the disruptor basically takes advantage of this thing
 that
 everyone else assumes is a big expensive hard-to-do thing
 that has now
 become cheap and easy. So you end up wasting a lot of
 something and it looks
 horrifying to the incumbents, right? So they couldn’t
 possibly do that, you know.
 But you end up disrupting the industries that way and there
‘s a number of examples that
 of that that I went through. Yeah, because the first thing
 I think about is
 is data databases, you know, that we have Oracle and MS SQL
 that they’re
 Microsoft, they have these big monolithic products. But
 then along comes open
 source products like MySQL and Postgres which are now
 running huge operations.
 And before, I mean, they’re still incredibly intensely
 difficult problems they’re solving,
 but they’re able to take and disrupt the business of Post
gre, I mean, of Oracle.
 So yeah, so really the open source itself is one of those,
 the concept of open
 source, the concept that the best software you could buy is
 the stuff you
 get for free that’s built by a community is something that
 is sort of alien to
 the traditional enterprise software businesses where you
 have a
 product manager who comes up with an idea and then they go
 away and work on
 it for a few years and then they pop out with the product
 and try and sell it
 to you for a lot of money. And historically that was how
 you bought
 stuff because it was the best stuff you could get and these
 companies knew
 were the places that knew best how to build things. And I
 worked for Sun
 Microsystems for a long time and, you know, part of that
 process. But what
 really happened was the best things you can get now are
 free and they are built
 by communities and the best engineers don’t work at those
 enterprise
 companies, they work for end users. So, you know, the most
 interesting scale
 available reliable software now is coming from open source
 projects and I
 highlighted a few of those in the talk. So that’s one
 disruption. Another one I
 mentioned was solid-state disk replacing spinning raster to
 traditional
 disks and that the way that that has completely taken what
 used to be a it’s
 a multi-trillion dollar business or whatever it is in
 storage and if you
 look at the way that a Cassandra based deployment on AWS is
 there are no storage admin
 there’s no SAN, there’s some SSD inside an instance and
 that’s all there is. So
 the person managing it is probably a Java distributed
 systems programmer,
 developer type of person with a little bit of operational
 experience to
 automate how to keep that thing up and running. But there’s
 no layers and
 layers of SAN fabrics and storage arrays have completely
 disappeared so
 it’s not just that you disrupt the product, you make the
 entire product
 category disappear. That’s one of the most disruptive
 things that’s going on right now.
 I have to think about when you’re talking about trying to
 change the
 mindset of people who’ve built their own business, their
 entire business on a
 certain set of assumptions and looking at more about just a
 human quirk there.
 I’m just reading an article about how people who have
 deeply held beliefs that
 they’ve internalized into their own persona, their own
 personality, and
 that’s the only way to get them to change their thoughts.
 You can’t just say
 here’s a fact that you what you know is wrong. You have to
 just change literally
 the way they think and address their personality. Is that
 something that
 when you think about when we’re dealing with these
 companies that have
 these deeply embedded, entrenched I should say, not
 embedded, but deeply
 entrenched processes like this is how we build software
 because this is how
 things are done, this is how we develop products, and how
 we can apply
 them. Do you talk about a little bit how we can approach
 those
 kind of thought processes and address them and work within
 them?
 Sure, so I talked about a few other things. I had a whole
 hour, so
 there was a lot of things I covered. One of them was
 continuous
 delivery as another way of disruptively speeding things up.
 The
 assumption you’re making there is that you can move a lot
 quicker, but
 what it really comes down to is the
 DevOps kind of approach where you’re actually taking away
 the handoffs
 between teams. So everyone knows that developers have to
 stay in
 development and operations people run their code and they
‘re different kinds
 of people and they optimize for different things. But if
 you reorganize
 so that you put them in the same organization, you blend
 those
 responsibilities and you automate everything. It’s not just
 that you create
 a DevOps team, it’s that you actually have to reorganize
 your company and have a cultural change.
 So DevOps is in many ways a cultural problem and companies
 that get over that
 are the ones that are doing well. So somebody tweeted a few
 days ago, “Is DevOps
 ready for the enterprise?” That was a question. My response
 was it’s the other
 way around. The enterprises that are ready for DevOps are
 the ones that are
 going to disrupt the enterprises that aren’t.
 Oh okay, so they’re going to just knock out the ones that
 aren’t.
 Yeah, it’s much harder to compare.
 If you’re running, if every time you do a product release
 it takes you a year
 to get it to customers and your competitors doing it in a
 few weeks and
 learning and you’re being able to run rings around you. So
 that is the sort of
 existential challenge that a lot of companies are getting
 through right
 now. And the other big change is that software used to be a
 little thing on
 the side for a lot of companies and now it’s central. It’s
 central to everything
 they do. It’s central to the way they do marketing and
 sales and build things and
 the way they support customers and the way they deliver
 products. Internet of
 Things is just one aspect of that. But what you’re seeing
 is this whole
 software eats the world, driving people. And now it’s
 central, they have to get
 good at it. And so they’re looking to the big enterprise
 companies, the big web
 companies as examples of how to do that. Netflix is one
 example. It’s a very, very
 rapid development process. Google, Twitter, Facebook, all
 of those companies are
 leading in this space.
 And the enterprises around the world are trying to figure
 out, how do we learn,
 what do we learn from them and how do we adopt it?
 Yeah, oh sorry, go ahead. So that was kind of the first
 part of the talk. The second
 part was some more practical things about what that
 actually means in
 practice for a developer. There’s some techniques and I was
 trying to
 make it a little bit more hands-on and a bit more detailed.
 So the talk was kind
 of a little in two sections.
 Yeah, the reason that what I was about to say is that I
 interviewed Bill Scott,
 who’s with PayPal, and he talked about how it was fresh off
 of the acquisition
 of Braintree and how PayPal is trying to rethink their
 entire business process.
 And they were looking at companies like Braintree who were
 able to deliver
 these things. And a lot of people in the press that I heard
 were looking very
 skeptically on PayPal acquiring Braintrust, thinking, “Okay
, well I’m
 Braintree, well that’s going to bust the Braintrust at Bra
intree.” That’s what I thought.
 Say that 10 times. But when he described it, they said, “No
, we’re looking at how
 they do things and really trying to figure out how to bring
 those into our
 operations, in a nutshell.”
 Sure. I worked with Bill Scott when he was at Netflix and I
 actually worked at eBay, PayPal, back before I joined
 Netflix.
 So I get some of the challenges there. You’ve got a
 successful business and
 it’s working and then you have to, you know, PayPal has
 this big challenge from other
 financial processing stuff like Square and Stripe and
 whatever. Those companies
 are, you know, we’re more agile and PayPal’s trying to
 respond to that. And
 they’re doing a pretty good job and what Bill’s doing there
 is good work to
 move them strongly in that direction. It’s good to see. If
 you were to go and
 just flip a bit and everybody’s head was in your talk and
 have them take
 home at least one factoid or one idea, what would you like
 to have impressed
 upon them the most?
 I think from sort of questioning the assumptions you’ve got
, right? Look at
 the way you’re operating, what you’re doing and what
 assumptions you’re
 making. And if you’re assuming something and optimizing for
 it and then you look
 at the trend for that thing and, you know, it’s either
 going to suddenly stop being
 true or over time it’s going to stop being true, make those
 explicit and get out ahead of those
 examples. One of the key things that Netflix does, it tries
 to lean into
 the future. If there’s a trend towards cloud, they’ll get
 in early and they’ll
 dive in and they’ll learn how to get good at it before it’s
 really ready for
 mass consumption. And that is a very powerful technique for
 learning how to
 take full advantage. So once it becomes mass adoption, you
‘re already well
 optimized for it, so you have that advantage.
 Okay, well thank you very much for taking the time to speak

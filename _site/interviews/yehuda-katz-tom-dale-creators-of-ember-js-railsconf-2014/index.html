    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at RailsConf 2014, and\n I'm standing here with Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale, who are\n the creators of the Ember project and also a contributor to\n Rails.\n And Yehuda gave a keynote yesterday morning, and they also\n gave a talk about how to build a smart profiler for Rails.\n So thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me\n. I appreciate it.\n So Yehuda, I know it's the end of the day and we're all\n pretty tired, but can you sum it up, a little memory of the\n keynote talk you gave yesterday and what the topic was?\n Sure. So I basically sort of talked about two areas.\n The first area was just sort of talking about the idea of\n cognitive or ego-deprivation.\n Which is this idea that we have a limited store of\n cognitive capacity, it's sort of like you have a battery.\n Like the end of the day at a conference.\n Yeah, like the end of the day at a conference.\n We've made so many decisions today.\n And so a lot of people think of cognitive capacity as\n something that you drain uniformly through the day or it\n drains when you work on hard problems.\n But actually it turns out that a lot of the things that\n drain your cognitive capacity are really mundane things\n like making choices or getting into a little bit of an\n argument can be really depleting.\n You could spend like five minutes getting into an argument,\n and you've probably felt this.\n Right.\n After five minutes.\n You've drained for the rest of the day.\n Well, it's like when you go to the grocery store.\n If you think about it, you're there for like an hour, you\n're constantly making decisions.\n And you get to the checkout line and there's a candy bar.\n Is there a reason there's a candy bar there?\n Because what brand of spaghetti sauce should I buy causes\n your willpower to deplete?\n So willpower, all these things are sort of the same thing.\n And the idea was just showing a conventional reconfig\nurationist idea that Rails, I think, spent a lot of time and\n energy advocating for.\n It's basically part of the same thing.\n It's really about making choices and getting everyone on\n the same page about defaults.\n Because defaults are really a psychological hack that we\n can use to allow us to both, when we're in a really good\n mood, allow us to do more before we deplete, use up too\n much of our capacity, but also keep us on the straight and\n narrow when we're in a bad mood.\n So you may think when you're being a programmer, what do I\n name this controller, that you think that it has zero cost.\n But in fact, it's actually sapping your willpower and your\n ability to actually think through the more important\n problems.\n Yeah.\n I know.\n I've done it myself.\n But it's hard to even get started because I'm thinking\n about, do I want to do Postgres or MySQL?\n And really silly decisions like that by the time you've\n made a few of them.\n And I think the important part is not to say, well, we're\n going to take away your decision making because people don\n't like losing autonomy for very good reasons.\n What you're saying is we're just going to give you some\n sane defaults.\n Defaults are the hack that you use to prevent yourself from\n being cognitively depleted so you have the energy to work\n on the real problems that matter for your business or for\n your product.\n And even thinking about defaults, did you ever see the\n movie Moscow and the Hudson with Robin Williams?\n There's a wonderful scene, it's from the '80s, but whenever\n I think about cognitive overload, I think about that scene\n where he goes and he wants to just buy coffee.\n And he's from the Soviet Union.\n He just wants to buy coffee.\n And he looks at the coffee and he says, Folgers, taster's\n choice.\n And then finally he's looking and then finally he's running\n back and forth and he's like, coffee, coffee, coffee.\n And he passes out.\n Because, you know, those choices go wrong.\n People like, what's the quote?\n People like choices a lot more than they like having to\n choose.\n Yeah.\n So that was sort of the first half of it.\n The second half was talking about all the excuses that\n people give themselves to justify not building up these\n abstractions.\n So I think one of the most common ones is like, oh, I'm so\n special.\n I have all these special needs, special requirements.\n And if I don't, you know, if you make me use a tool that's\n for everybody, how am I going to get my job done?\n You know, all the being so special.\n And then people, even when people get past that and they\n say, you know, I am doing really the same thing as everyone\n else, they use this excuse of the law of leaky abstractions\n.\n Like, oh, these abstractions, these abstractions are always\n leaked so there's no point in even bothering with them.\n And you, ironically, you see people making these arguments\n about leaky abstractions sitting on the top of the most\n epic abstraction stack, right?\n So you have node people who are really allergic to abstract\nions.\n But they're sitting on top of not just, you know, not just\n a hardware abstraction.\n But C, Unix, POSIX, libUV, you know, one of the most\n amazing dynamic language jits that have ever been created.\n And then on the top of that, they say, oh, promises.\n That's such a heavy abstraction.\n I don't know how I'm going to deal with that.\n Well, this is really funny, too, because you think about,\n like, it wasn't that long ago that people were literally,\n like, if you want, like, hardware was bespoke.\n Like, every new chip was completely custom silicon.\n Right.\n And then at some point, processors, CPUs, like general\n processors.\n Got sufficiently good as an abstraction that everyone's\n like, you know what?\n It's silly for me to be laying out my own chips.\n Let's just use this off-the-shelf Intel chipset, right?\n And you never think about it.\n No one ever is thinking, okay, I want a new computer.\n Should I get x86 or should I build my own?\n It's like, okay, I'm just going to use x86 or ARM.\n Those are the two things everyone's agreed upon.\n Nobody thinks about that.\n So it's a little bit arrogant, I think.\n But this happens every layer of the abstraction stack.\n Everyone always thinks, like, well, I rely on all these\n abstractions.\n But I'm at the peak of it.\n The thing that I am doing is so unique.\n Like, really, there's no shared solution or shared\n abstraction that could possibly encapsulate this problem\n that I'm having.\n Until you get to it, right?\n I am going to cut this piece of wood.\n I need to go and craft something in which I can separate\n these pieces of wood from each other.\n Right, yeah, yeah, exactly.\n No, you just go grab the saw.\n Yeah, exactly.\n Exactly, exactly.\n And it's fine.\n And I think the reason is that people go in when you're --\n there's kind of, as you said, there's this layer of\n experimentation at the top.\n So there's the abstraction stack.\n And then at the top, there's always a layer of\n experimentation.\n And especially, like, younger developers, less experienced\n developers, they come in and they say, well, you know, I\n tried the abstraction.\n It wasn't perfect yet.\n It leaked a lot.\n It wasn't quite perfect.\n And so their reaction is not, well, I should wait for this\n to mature.\n Their reaction is, well, of course, this abstraction, on\n principle, must be bad because I failed at it.\n Right.\n And then the next time they see an abstraction, they\n basically just hate it.\n They hate all abstractions.\n And, yeah.\n And I think what's kind of cool is that when you get past\n this, when you say, no.\n x86 is a thing.\n Unix is a thing.\n C is a thing.\n You can actually start building much, much higher than you\n thought you could build before.\n You actually start being able to -- you get into a place\n where you have shared understanding of what it is that you\n're building.\n And you can, as Steve Jobs said in the quote that I excer\npted in my talk, you can start from the 20th floor instead\n of starting from the first floor.\n And there's way too many people that are always thinking,\n oh, I'll just -- you know, I'll start from the first floor\n every time.\n It's a lot simpler.\n Right.\n But, really, you want to be building things.\n Having that shared understanding.\n Having that shared understanding allows everyone to kind of\n, like, solve the problem once and then start building on\n top.\n And a lot of times, as you could have said in the\n presentation, that means having shared implementation, like\n Rails, Ember.\n These are shared implementations that everyone can build on\n top of.\n But even if you don't share the implementation, even just\n sharing common vocabulary, having a common interface.\n So a good example that you could have used was the idea of\n promises in JavaScript.\n Everyone was having to deal with asynchronous values.\n Everyone was implementing promises as a way of solving that\n.\n But everyone was implementing it just a little bit\n differently.\n And you really couldn't build -- you couldn't use these\n pieces together.\n You couldn't build on that abstraction.\n So Dominic DeNicola really was the one that drove, okay,\n well, hey, look, we're all doing similar things.\n I'm going to write a spec.\n And it's going to be a set of tests.\n It's going to be a test suite.\n And if you write a promises implementation, everyone just\n conform to this.\n And that, I think, had really unexpected properties.\n Emergent properties where, okay, now everyone's centered on\n the spec.\n Now it's in the DOM spec.\n Now it's in the W3C specs.\n And now actually support for it is being built into the\n language.\n And that had to happen in a layered abstraction.\n Yeah, because it gets to be something almost like an if\n scene.\n It's a construct that you're going to be able to take for\n granted, that you're going to be able to go from one\n platform.\n You're already in this language.\n It would be like if there was no if and everyone wrote a if\n function using gotos.\n Well, you could imagine that someone says, I don't really\n think control flow really belongs in --\n So this is the thing people say about problems.\n I don't understand why control flow is in the language.\n It's like, hey, guys, guess what?\n Control flow is in the language.\n It's the only if statement.\n It'll be okay.\n I think we can add another asynchronous control flow\n primitive to the language, and I don't think anything's\n going to explode.\n Yeah, yeah.\n And as far as working in these abstractions, it can become\n complicated.\n And there's a product that you guys have launched.\n And as I said when I was interviewing Leah, I'm not being\n sponsored by this, but you guys are doing great.\n You have a long history of just putting stuff in the\n community.\n So I wanted to promote your company.\n So can you tell us a little bit about Chill Day and the\n products that you're creating?\n Sure, yeah.\n Because it relates also to your talk.\n I think it's actually related to the open source work as\n well because the last company that we all worked at\n together, so the founders, me, Yehuda, Leah, and Carl, we\n all worked at a VC-backed company before.\n And the experience was great.\n It was very emphasized open source.\n But at the end of the day --\n You know, the money, it wasn't necessarily self-sustaining.\n If you didn't achieve liftoff right away, it's basically\n like the team got scattered to the winds.\n And so when we started Tilda, we really wanted to do\n something that was bootstrapped.\n We wanted to be bootstrapped and proud.\n But it turns out it's hard to be bootstrapped and proud if\n you're bootstrapped and bankrupt.\n Yeah.\n So we needed some way to make money.\n And the obvious way to do that is to become Ember Inc.,\n right?\n There's like Fondo BB Inc.\n There's Meteor Inc.\n And there's --\n NTM Inc.\n NTM Inc.\n There's like a long somewhat history of VC-backed companies\n doing open source work.\n Yeah.\n Where that's like the company drive.\n And that's a totally plausible model.\n But for us, we feel like the best innovation happens when\n you have this coalition of companies all working together.\n And there's no one dominant company.\n We like Postgres.\n We like Rails where there's a core team.\n And there are members from many different companies all\n working on that problem.\n They steward it.\n They do a lot of work on it.\n And you have to reach consensus.\n And actually, you can't bully ideas.\n And you have to argue for your ideas on the strengths of\n their merits.\n And I think that's very important.\n So, what do we do now?\n Well, we wanted to build something cool.\n We didn't want to build something really lame.\n We believe in tackling hard problems.\n And we also believe in playing to your strengths.\n So, we spent a long time thinking about, okay, well, what\n are our strengths?\n So, one, I think we know how to build developer tools.\n We've been doing it for a long time.\n Carl's a badass at building distributed systems.\n Yeah.\n And I think we have a pretty --\n And we know the Rails stack.\n And we know the Rails stack.\n Yeah, obviously.\n We know the Rails stack.\n So, that's it.\n You guys picked it up at some point.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n So, we've been doing it for a long time.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n So, we built Skylight.\n And the reason we built Skylight was that all the way back\n in 2009, hard to believe,\n five years ago, DHH wrote a blog post called \"The Problem\n with Averages.\"\n And he said, \"If you're thinking about the performance of\n your web app, thinking in terms\n of averages, the words he used were useless and wrong.\"\n He said, \"What you really need is a histogram.\n You need to see the distribution, because if you're a\n statistician, you use a lot of\n numbers.\n And if you're not a statistician, you use a lot of numbers\n.\"\n And so, we built Skylight.\n And I think we have a pretty --\n And we know the Rails stack.\n And we know the Rails stack.\n And we know the Rails stack.\n Yeah, obviously.\n We know the Rails stack.\n So, that's it.\n And he said, \"If you're thinking about the performance of\n your web app, thinking in terms\n of averages, the words he used were useless and wrong.\"\n He said, \"What you really need is a histogram.\n You need to see the distribution, because if you're a\n statistician, you use averages\n to think about normal bell curves.\"\n Right.\n But that's not what response times are.\n Yeah.\n So, he said this in 2009.\n It's 2014.\n And there still has not been any tool on the market that\n developers could take off the\n shelf and get that tool.\n Right?\n Right.\n If you're a product developer, you can't do that.\n Right.\n If you're a product developer, you can't do that.\n Right.\n Right.\n If you're a product developer, you can't do that.\n Right.\n If you're a Google, or you're a Facebook, or a Twitter, you\n have teams building this\n for you, but that's not Joe or small shop.\n Right.\n So, that's what Skylight does.\n Skylight basically gives you the tools that the big\n companies have to think about for\n web performance in a way that's super accessible, super\n fast, and member app is really, really\n fast, really responsive, and I think pretty easy to use.\n Is it possible with Skylight?\n Skylight to be able to look at the metrics and be able to\n try to figure out what kind\n of characteristics, like a specific type of user, like an\n admin logging in and doing a\n bunch of crazy...\n So, that's what the histogram is for.\n Yeah.\n Basically, if you have an average, you're taking cache hits\n, cache misses, RSS feeds,\n XHRs, admin users, that causes three more database queries\n to happen.\n Yeah.\n You're taking all of that and you're compressing it into a\n single number.\n So, having the histogram there, we keep the whole\n distribution.\n So, we can show you the histogram for any time slice.\n Up to 30 days for any endpoint, and so you can see, like, \"\nOh, it looks like there's\n a cluster.\"\n You can zoom in and you can say, \"Oh, it looks like if the\n request is taking 700 milliseconds\n instead of 200, it's because I'm doing all these extra\n queries for myself.\"\n So, one thing that you left out is that it's not just the\n histogram.\n Once you've decided what part of the distribution you want\n to look at, you actually get a really\n high-fidelity trace, which tells you, you know, first you\n had this wrap thing, then\n you went into this controller, then you made these three\n database queries, then you started\n rendering a template, and you made these three database\n queries.\n Yeah.\n And we just announced at RailsConf that we're adding CPU\n profiling, very, very\n low impact, maybe, like, 10 microseconds per request of\n impact to do CPU profiling, and\n then that means we'll be able to say, \"Here are the actual\n Ruby, here's the Ruby code that\n actually is spent, that actually was spent.\"\n So, we can basically not just show you, \"Here's the\n distribution of your request,\" but we can\n show you exactly what is happening inside those requests,\n and not just what's happening\n inside of, you know, the average request, but what's\n happening in slow requests or fast\n requests, you can compare, you know, maybe a fast request\n is fast because your request\n is fast.\n You're not running all the scores.\n You can drill in and look at it.\n And that maybe sounds like an incremental improvement, but\n it actually completely,\n completely changes the way that you diagnose.\n It changes how you diagnose performance, right?\n Because the way that you can do it today, without Skylight,\n is you say, \"Oh, it looks\n like there was a spike in production.\n Our response has gotten really bad.\"\n And you know they're bad, because if the average is bad,\n then you know it's really\n bad.\n So, you're like, \"Okay, let's go diagnose this.\"\n So, what do you do?\n You check out the app on your local machine, you run it,\n you maybe put some seed data,\n you run it.\n You try to, like, put some load on it.\n You plug it into the production database.\n You can't reproduce it.\n Well, I guess we'll just pray that this doesn't happen\n again.\n But what you can do with Skylight is you have a graph,\n right?\n You zoom back to see, \"Ah, here's a spike.\n Here's where the 95% average spike is.\"\n Select it in the chart, and now you have a full fidelity\n stack trace of exactly what\n was happening in your app in production, on your production\n boxes.\n And it doesn't matter.\n You don't have to think about it ahead of time.\n You can go back 30 days.\n Yeah.\n And, I mean, could I even find out, like, maybe, you know,\n like, what was happening\n in your app in production, on your production boxes.\n And it doesn't matter.\n You don't have to think about it ahead of time.\n You can go back 30 days.\n Yeah.\n And, I mean, could I even find out, like, maybe if another\n process was impacting what\n I'm doing?\n Like, if I'm running something.\n So, I'm looking at my app, and it's, I get these really\n slow requests at a certain time\n in the day.\n I can't see anything weird in my app, but this is what I'm\n seeing.\n And, like, I'm running a lot of stuff.\n And, like, I'm running a lot of stuff.\n And, like, I'm running a lot of stuff.\n And, like, I'm running a lot of stuff.\n And, like, I'm running a lot of stuff.\n And,

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at RailsConf 2014, and
 I’m standing here with Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale, who are
 the creators of the Ember project and also a contributor to
 Rails.
 And Yehuda gave a keynote yesterday morning, and they also
 gave a talk about how to build a smart profiler for Rails.
 So thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me
. I appreciate it.
 So Yehuda, I know it’s the end of the day and we’re all
 pretty tired, but can you sum it up, a little memory of the
 keynote talk you gave yesterday and what the topic was?
 Sure. So I basically sort of talked about two areas.
 The first area was just sort of talking about the idea of
 cognitive or ego-deprivation.
 Which is this idea that we have a limited store of
 cognitive capacity, it’s sort of like you have a battery.
 Like the end of the day at a conference.
 Yeah, like the end of the day at a conference.
 We’ve made so many decisions today.
 And so a lot of people think of cognitive capacity as
 something that you drain uniformly through the day or it
 drains when you work on hard problems.
 But actually it turns out that a lot of the things that
 drain your cognitive capacity are really mundane things
 like making choices or getting into a little bit of an
 argument can be really depleting.
 You could spend like five minutes getting into an argument,
 and you’ve probably felt this.
 Right.
 After five minutes.
 You’ve drained for the rest of the day.
 Well, it’s like when you go to the grocery store.
 If you think about it, you’re there for like an hour, you
‘re constantly making decisions.
 And you get to the checkout line and there’s a candy bar.
 Is there a reason there’s a candy bar there?
 Because what brand of spaghetti sauce should I buy causes
 your willpower to deplete?
 So willpower, all these things are sort of the same thing.
 And the idea was just showing a conventional reconfig
urationist idea that Rails, I think, spent a lot of time and
 energy advocating for.
 It’s basically part of the same thing.
 It’s really about making choices and getting everyone on
 the same page about defaults.
 Because defaults are really a psychological hack that we
 can use to allow us to both, when we’re in a really good
 mood, allow us to do more before we deplete, use up too
 much of our capacity, but also keep us on the straight and
 narrow when we’re in a bad mood.
 So you may think when you’re being a programmer, what do I
 name this controller, that you think that it has zero cost.
 But in fact, it’s actually sapping your willpower and your
 ability to actually think through the more important
 problems.
 Yeah.
 I know.
 I’ve done it myself.
 But it’s hard to even get started because I’m thinking
 about, do I want to do Postgres or MySQL?
 And really silly decisions like that by the time you’ve
 made a few of them.
 And I think the important part is not to say, well, we’re
 going to take away your decision making because people don
‘t like losing autonomy for very good reasons.
 What you’re saying is we’re just going to give you some
 sane defaults.
 Defaults are the hack that you use to prevent yourself from
 being cognitively depleted so you have the energy to work
 on the real problems that matter for your business or for
 your product.
 And even thinking about defaults, did you ever see the
 movie Moscow and the Hudson with Robin Williams?
 There’s a wonderful scene, it’s from the ’80s, but whenever
 I think about cognitive overload, I think about that scene
 where he goes and he wants to just buy coffee.
 And he’s from the Soviet Union.
 He just wants to buy coffee.
 And he looks at the coffee and he says, Folgers, taster’s
 choice.
 And then finally he’s looking and then finally he’s running
 back and forth and he’s like, coffee, coffee, coffee.
 And he passes out.
 Because, you know, those choices go wrong.
 People like, what’s the quote?
 People like choices a lot more than they like having to
 choose.
 Yeah.
 So that was sort of the first half of it.
 The second half was talking about all the excuses that
 people give themselves to justify not building up these
 abstractions.
 So I think one of the most common ones is like, oh, I’m so
 special.
 I have all these special needs, special requirements.
 And if I don’t, you know, if you make me use a tool that’s
 for everybody, how am I going to get my job done?
 You know, all the being so special.
 And then people, even when people get past that and they
 say, you know, I am doing really the same thing as everyone
 else, they use this excuse of the law of leaky abstractions
.
 Like, oh, these abstractions, these abstractions are always
 leaked so there’s no point in even bothering with them.
 And you, ironically, you see people making these arguments
 about leaky abstractions sitting on the top of the most
 epic abstraction stack, right?
 So you have node people who are really allergic to abstract
ions.
 But they’re sitting on top of not just, you know, not just
 a hardware abstraction.
 But C, Unix, POSIX, libUV, you know, one of the most
 amazing dynamic language jits that have ever been created.
 And then on the top of that, they say, oh, promises.
 That’s such a heavy abstraction.
 I don’t know how I’m going to deal with that.
 Well, this is really funny, too, because you think about,
 like, it wasn’t that long ago that people were literally,
 like, if you want, like, hardware was bespoke.
 Like, every new chip was completely custom silicon.
 Right.
 And then at some point, processors, CPUs, like general
 processors.
 Got sufficiently good as an abstraction that everyone’s
 like, you know what?
 It’s silly for me to be laying out my own chips.
 Let’s just use this off-the-shelf Intel chipset, right?
 And you never think about it.
 No one ever is thinking, okay, I want a new computer.
 Should I get x86 or should I build my own?
 It’s like, okay, I’m just going to use x86 or ARM.
 Those are the two things everyone’s agreed upon.
 Nobody thinks about that.
 So it’s a little bit arrogant, I think.
 But this happens every layer of the abstraction stack.
 Everyone always thinks, like, well, I rely on all these
 abstractions.
 But I’m at the peak of it.
 The thing that I am doing is so unique.
 Like, really, there’s no shared solution or shared
 abstraction that could possibly encapsulate this problem
 that I’m having.
 Until you get to it, right?
 I am going to cut this piece of wood.
 I need to go and craft something in which I can separate
 these pieces of wood from each other.
 Right, yeah, yeah, exactly.
 No, you just go grab the saw.
 Yeah, exactly.
 Exactly, exactly.
 And it’s fine.
 And I think the reason is that people go in when you’re –
 there’s kind of, as you said, there’s this layer of
 experimentation at the top.
 So there’s the abstraction stack.
 And then at the top, there’s always a layer of
 experimentation.
 And especially, like, younger developers, less experienced
 developers, they come in and they say, well, you know, I
 tried the abstraction.
 It wasn’t perfect yet.
 It leaked a lot.
 It wasn’t quite perfect.
 And so their reaction is not, well, I should wait for this
 to mature.
 Their reaction is, well, of course, this abstraction, on
 principle, must be bad because I failed at it.
 Right.
 And then the next time they see an abstraction, they
 basically just hate it.
 They hate all abstractions.
 And, yeah.
 And I think what’s kind of cool is that when you get past
 this, when you say, no.
 x86 is a thing.
 Unix is a thing.
 C is a thing.
 You can actually start building much, much higher than you
 thought you could build before.
 You actually start being able to – you get into a place
 where you have shared understanding of what it is that you
‘re building.
 And you can, as Steve Jobs said in the quote that I excer
pted in my talk, you can start from the 20th floor instead
 of starting from the first floor.
 And there’s way too many people that are always thinking,
 oh, I’ll just – you know, I’ll start from the first floor
 every time.
 It’s a lot simpler.
 Right.
 But, really, you want to be building things.
 Having that shared understanding.
 Having that shared understanding allows everyone to kind of
, like, solve the problem once and then start building on
 top.
 And a lot of times, as you could have said in the
 presentation, that means having shared implementation, like
 Rails, Ember.
 These are shared implementations that everyone can build on
 top of.
 But even if you don’t share the implementation, even just
 sharing common vocabulary, having a common interface.
 So a good example that you could have used was the idea of
 promises in JavaScript.
 Everyone was having to deal with asynchronous values.
 Everyone was implementing promises as a way of solving that
.
 But everyone was implementing it just a little bit
 differently.
 And you really couldn’t build – you couldn’t use these
 pieces together.
 You couldn’t build on that abstraction.
 So Dominic DeNicola really was the one that drove, okay,
 well, hey, look, we’re all doing similar things.
 I’m going to write a spec.
 And it’s going to be a set of tests.
 It’s going to be a test suite.
 And if you write a promises implementation, everyone just
 conform to this.
 And that, I think, had really unexpected properties.
 Emergent properties where, okay, now everyone’s centered on
 the spec.
 Now it’s in the DOM spec.
 Now it’s in the W3C specs.
 And now actually support for it is being built into the
 language.
 And that had to happen in a layered abstraction.
 Yeah, because it gets to be something almost like an if
 scene.
 It’s a construct that you’re going to be able to take for
 granted, that you’re going to be able to go from one
 platform.
 You’re already in this language.
 It would be like if there was no if and everyone wrote a if
 function using gotos.
 Well, you could imagine that someone says, I don’t really
 think control flow really belongs in –
 So this is the thing people say about problems.
 I don’t understand why control flow is in the language.
 It’s like, hey, guys, guess what?
 Control flow is in the language.
 It’s the only if statement.
 It’ll be okay.
 I think we can add another asynchronous control flow
 primitive to the language, and I don’t think anything’s
 going to explode.
 Yeah, yeah.
 And as far as working in these abstractions, it can become
 complicated.
 And there’s a product that you guys have launched.
 And as I said when I was interviewing Leah, I’m not being
 sponsored by this, but you guys are doing great.
 You have a long history of just putting stuff in the
 community.
 So I wanted to promote your company.
 So can you tell us a little bit about Chill Day and the
 products that you’re creating?
 Sure, yeah.
 Because it relates also to your talk.
 I think it’s actually related to the open source work as
 well because the last company that we all worked at
 together, so the founders, me, Yehuda, Leah, and Carl, we
 all worked at a VC-backed company before.
 And the experience was great.
 It was very emphasized open source.
 But at the end of the day –
 You know, the money, it wasn’t necessarily self-sustaining.
 If you didn’t achieve liftoff right away, it’s basically
 like the team got scattered to the winds.
 And so when we started Tilda, we really wanted to do
 something that was bootstrapped.
 We wanted to be bootstrapped and proud.
 But it turns out it’s hard to be bootstrapped and proud if
 you’re bootstrapped and bankrupt.
 Yeah.
 So we needed some way to make money.
 And the obvious way to do that is to become Ember Inc.,
 right?
 There’s like Fondo BB Inc.
 There’s Meteor Inc.
 And there’s –
 NTM Inc.
 NTM Inc.
 There’s like a long somewhat history of VC-backed companies
 doing open source work.
 Yeah.
 Where that’s like the company drive.
 And that’s a totally plausible model.
 But for us, we feel like the best innovation happens when
 you have this coalition of companies all working together.
 And there’s no one dominant company.
 We like Postgres.
 We like Rails where there’s a core team.
 And there are members from many different companies all
 working on that problem.
 They steward it.
 They do a lot of work on it.
 And you have to reach consensus.
 And actually, you can’t bully ideas.
 And you have to argue for your ideas on the strengths of
 their merits.
 And I think that’s very important.
 So, what do we do now?
 Well, we wanted to build something cool.
 We didn’t want to build something really lame.
 We believe in tackling hard problems.
 And we also believe in playing to your strengths.
 So, we spent a long time thinking about, okay, well, what
 are our strengths?
 So, one, I think we know how to build developer tools.
 We’ve been doing it for a long time.
 Carl’s a badass at building distributed systems.
 Yeah.
 And I think we have a pretty –
 And we know the Rails stack.
 And we know the Rails stack.
 Yeah, obviously.
 We know the Rails stack.
 So, that’s it.
 You guys picked it up at some point.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So, we’ve been doing it for a long time.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So, we built Skylight.
 And the reason we built Skylight was that all the way back
 in 2009, hard to believe,
 five years ago, DHH wrote a blog post called “The Problem
 with Averages.”
 And he said, “If you’re thinking about the performance of
 your web app, thinking in terms
 of averages, the words he used were useless and wrong.”
 He said, “What you really need is a histogram.
 You need to see the distribution, because if you’re a
 statistician, you use a lot of
 numbers.
 And if you’re not a statistician, you use a lot of numbers
.”
 And so, we built Skylight.
 And I think we have a pretty –
 And we know the Rails stack.
 And we know the Rails stack.
 And we know the Rails stack.
 Yeah, obviously.
 We know the Rails stack.
 So, that’s it.
 And he said, “If you’re thinking about the performance of
 your web app, thinking in terms
 of averages, the words he used were useless and wrong.”
 He said, “What you really need is a histogram.
 You need to see the distribution, because if you’re a
 statistician, you use averages
 to think about normal bell curves.”
 Right.
 But that’s not what response times are.
 Yeah.
 So, he said this in 2009.
 It’s 2014.
 And there still has not been any tool on the market that
 developers could take off the
 shelf and get that tool.
 Right?
 Right.
 If you’re a product developer, you can’t do that.
 Right.
 If you’re a product developer, you can’t do that.
 Right.
 Right.
 If you’re a product developer, you can’t do that.
 Right.
 If you’re a Google, or you’re a Facebook, or a Twitter, you
 have teams building this
 for you, but that’s not Joe or small shop.
 Right.
 So, that’s what Skylight does.
 Skylight basically gives you the tools that the big
 companies have to think about for
 web performance in a way that’s super accessible, super
 fast, and member app is really, really
 fast, really responsive, and I think pretty easy to use.
 Is it possible with Skylight?
 Skylight to be able to look at the metrics and be able to
 try to figure out what kind
 of characteristics, like a specific type of user, like an
 admin logging in and doing a
 bunch of crazy…
 So, that’s what the histogram is for.
 Yeah.
 Basically, if you have an average, you’re taking cache hits
, cache misses, RSS feeds,
 XHRs, admin users, that causes three more database queries
 to happen.
 Yeah.
 You’re taking all of that and you’re compressing it into a
 single number.
 So, having the histogram there, we keep the whole
 distribution.
 So, we can show you the histogram for any time slice.
 Up to 30 days for any endpoint, and so you can see, like, “
Oh, it looks like there’s
 a cluster.”
 You can zoom in and you can say, “Oh, it looks like if the
 request is taking 700 milliseconds
 instead of 200, it’s because I’m doing all these extra
 queries for myself.”
 So, one thing that you left out is that it’s not just the
 histogram.
 Once you’ve decided what part of the distribution you want
 to look at, you actually get a really
 high-fidelity trace, which tells you, you know, first you
 had this wrap thing, then
 you went into this controller, then you made these three
 database queries, then you started
 rendering a template, and you made these three database
 queries.
 Yeah.
 And we just announced at RailsConf that we’re adding CPU
 profiling, very, very
 low impact, maybe, like, 10 microseconds per request of
 impact to do CPU profiling, and
 then that means we’ll be able to say, “Here are the actual
 Ruby, here’s the Ruby code that
 actually is spent, that actually was spent.”
 So, we can basically not just show you, “Here’s the
 distribution of your request,” but we can
 show you exactly what is happening inside those requests,
 and not just what’s happening
 inside of, you know, the average request, but what’s
 happening in slow requests or fast
 requests, you can compare, you know, maybe a fast request
 is fast because your request
 is fast.
 You’re not running all the scores.
 You can drill in and look at it.
 And that maybe sounds like an incremental improvement, but
 it actually completely,
 completely changes the way that you diagnose.
 It changes how you diagnose performance, right?
 Because the way that you can do it today, without Skylight,
 is you say, “Oh, it looks
 like there was a spike in production.
 Our response has gotten really bad.”
 And you know they’re bad, because if the average is bad,
 then you know it’s really
 bad.
 So, you’re like, “Okay, let’s go diagnose this.”
 So, what do you do?
 You check out the app on your local machine, you run it,
 you maybe put some seed data,
 you run it.
 You try to, like, put some load on it.
 You plug it into the production database.
 You can’t reproduce it.
 Well, I guess we’ll just pray that this doesn’t happen
 again.
 But what you can do with Skylight is you have a graph,
 right?
 You zoom back to see, “Ah, here’s a spike.
 Here’s where the 95% average spike is.”
 Select it in the chart, and now you have a full fidelity
 stack trace of exactly what
 was happening in your app in production, on your production
 boxes.
 And it doesn’t matter.
 You don’t have to think about it ahead of time.
 You can go back 30 days.
 Yeah.
 And, I mean, could I even find out, like, maybe, you know,
 like, what was happening
 in your app in production, on your production boxes.
 And it doesn’t matter.
 You don’t have to think about it ahead of time.
 You can go back 30 days.
 Yeah.
 And, I mean, could I even find out, like, maybe if another
 process was impacting what
 I’m doing?
 Like, if I’m running something.
 So, I’m looking at my app, and it’s, I get these really
 slow requests at a certain time
 in the day.
 I can’t see anything weird in my app, but this is what I’m
 seeing.

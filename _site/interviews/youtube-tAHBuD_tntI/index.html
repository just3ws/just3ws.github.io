    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2014 and I\n'm sitting here with\n Tim Bray who's the co-inventor of XML and he's a keynote\n speaker here today at\n the GOTO Conf. Thank you very much for taking the time to\n speak with me today,\n Tim. Can you tell us a little bit about your talk and what\n you're hoping people\n take home from it? Well I've been mixed up in my, you know,\n my most most recent\n job was at Google and I spent a couple of years in the\n Android groups there and\n then subsequently did work in other areas and I've become\n keenly aware of\n sort of the tension in the marketplace between people who\n are sort of browser\n and web technology centric and people who are mobile cent\nric and I think\n there's are some really good reasons to worry that the\n notion of the browser is\n losing its centrality in the world of app development.\n And so what I'm going to talk about today is, is that\n really a problem? Is that\n actually happening? And if so, why? And assuming it is\n happening, is that a\n problem that we should worry about? And if it's a problem\n we should worry about\n then is there anything we could do to improve it? Now this\n is unscheduled but\n I'm also going to take a side trip into privacy. Okay.\n Because I've been doing a\n lot of work on that recently and in the era of Ed Snowden,\n you know, we should all\n be worried about that. Yes. You may think you don't have a\n privacy problem in your work, but you probably do.\n Yeah. Well, I mean, even with services that are very\n popular like HipChat recently, I don't know if you're\n familiar with, they had a change in their privacy policy\n when our one-on-one\n chats are able to be exposed to your employer. I mean, even\n things like, like\n that. And when you talk, but to go back to your original\n keynote, when you're\n talking about browser versus non-browser, are you talking\n about native apps versus...\n Yeah, I'm talking about native apps. Okay. You know,\n increasingly if\n somebody's going to build an app, they're actually going to\n build three apps.\n They're going to build, you know, a browser version, an iOS\n version, an Android\n version, and that's already a problem because, you know,\n you're having to\n replicate your work multiple times to get a result. And who\n knows, you know,\n Windows Mobile could get a good foothold and we'd all be\n doing our work four\n times in a row. So right there there's a problem. And then\n even different form factors. Well, you know,\n that just comes with the game. That's actually, you know,\n not the big biggest part of the problem. And\n whereas, you know, there's a lot of advantages to mobile\n apps and people are moving in that\n direction for reasons, some of which are good, you know,\n there's some downsides to that too.\n And we need to, you know, make sure we understand what the\n upsides and downsides are of having a\n browser-centric worldview as opposed to a native mobile app\n-centric worldview and make the right\n choices in an intelligent way. And just, you know, to inter\nweave that\n into the privacy, is it a good thing that we're moving\n towards native apps versus\n browsers as far as, maybe, privacy is concerned? So the\n reason I ask is, I mean, I know cookies and\n spying, you know, cross-browser checking of cookies and\n tracking, that's one thing you can do in a\n browser but maybe you wouldn't be able to do like that in a\n native app. Yeah, I suppose, but I think that's a small\n issue compared to the big issues. And the big issues are,\n you know, the actual\n criminals and bad guys who are trying to subvert your\n account and steal your information\n and your money. And on the other hand, the over-enthusi\nastic employees of\n our governments who feel that, you know, everybody would\n just be safer if they\n knew everything about everybody and why would anybody want\n privacy unless they\n were doing something wrong? I think, you know, they have\n much bigger tools than\n cookies. They have, you know, court orders and national\n security letters for us to\n worry about. Well, I mean, there was actually a tweet I saw\n this morning\n about the amount of data that the NSA has collected was in\n the order of exabytes,\n but it would take 350 years to sort it. That, like, is\n there\n a point where they just have so much information and it\n becomes... Well, Google's\n got way more than that. Oh, okay. And Google, you know, can\n give you sub-second results on\n searching the whole thing. So, you know, that doesn't\n really sound like a...I wouldn't\n buy that argument. I think that if they employ smart people\n who know\n how to index things and so on, which they do, they would be\n able to make good use\n of that stuff. So, I mean, that kind of describes it. There\n is a precedent for having\n extremely large...I mean, we use it every day.\n It's become a household term. You know, grandmothers who've\n never used a computer,\n they know to Google for something. Right. And they can sift\n through data like\n nobody's business. That's right. Why wouldn't the NSA be\n able to do that? Exactly. What have you\n found in particular that maybe isn't something that people\n are really talking\n about yet? I mean, Snowden's obviously a very popular topic\n, but... Well, I think we\n need to buckle down and think about it. I think that, to\n start with, you know, the\n room I'm talking to today is going to be full of people who\n build apps. And a\n question I would have for them is, \"Are you really\n confident that your app will\n work if I address it with HTTPS URLs as opposed to HTTP\n URLs?\" Even better, you\n know, does your work...does your app automatically work\n with HTTPS only?\n Right. Because if you do that, then you've removed, you\n know, one huge window of\n vulnerability, ranging...which is open to anybody from the\n NSA to some guy\n running fire sheep in a coffee shop. Right. And I think it\n's, you know, it's\n incumbent upon the app builders to take a big piece of the\n responsibility for\n preserving the privacy of the people who use it. And that\n means they not only need\n to do the obvious things like use HTTPS, they need to think\n very carefully about,\n you know, what information they gather about people, what\n they store about people,\n what they tell people, what their policy is as regards\n legal demands that they receive.\n And they need to be clear about that stuff. And because laz\niness produces a really bad\n result. Yeah. Well, you know, having been guilty of that\n myself, as far as looking at\n the expedient problem, like, over the last few years, or\n several years ago, XML was\n the de facto way to exchange information. But over the last\n couple years, JSON has\n kind of become more popular. And there's...I've heard pros\n and cons about\n adopting a very strict semantic language like XML that can\n...excuse me,\n a more easily correct description of a language through XML\n versus kind of a loosey-goosey\n JSON. Is that something maybe that's indicative of the way\n we're approaching writing applications\n at this point? Where we're just like, what is the least\n amount of effort I need to do\n to push data over the wire? Should we be stepping back and\n really thinking more about how we're\n pushing stuff over the wire? Well, you may be right, but\n that's okay. I mean, there's\n so much work to do that we should all be trying to do the\n simplest thing that could possibly work.\n You know, do things in the simplest way that could work.\n Then you worry about your constraints.\n And as regards XML versus JSON, I mean, JSON is clearly,\n clearly superior if you're exchanging\n database records and file updates and that kind of stuff.\n If you're exchanging blog posts\n or credit reports or medical health records, XML wins for\n that. So they have different\n areas of strength. But I would worry not so much about the\n form of the content, whether it's XML or JSON. I'd worry\n about, is it traveling safely across the network in a way\n that somebody who's using my app can\n be really, really sure that they're connecting to me, not\n to somebody else, and that nobody\n else can watch the stuff going along? And then having\n established that, sort of the bare\n minimum barrier to entry, then you have to answer questions\n like, okay, if I use your\n app, what information are you gathering about me? How are\n you protecting it? Under what\n conditions will you release it and to whom? And, you know,\n you could write, there's a real big takeaway\n in letters of fire 50 feet high, and they say, don't\n surprise me. You know, if you, people are, end up getting\n a nasty surprise about what you're doing with their data,\n the results will be really bad for you, and you\n won't say you really want to avoid that.\n All right. Well, thank you very much for taking the time to\n speak with me. I appreciate it.\n User groups with lots to say, interviews and more, no way.\n Sharing great ideas in the tech community. Fascinating\n conversations, a plethora of information. Find out for\n yourself today at ugtastic.com.",

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2014 and I
‘m sitting here with
 Tim Bray who’s the co-inventor of XML and he’s a keynote
 speaker here today at
 the GOTO Conf. Thank you very much for taking the time to
 speak with me today,
 Tim. Can you tell us a little bit about your talk and what
 you’re hoping people
 take home from it? Well I’ve been mixed up in my, you know,
 my most most recent
 job was at Google and I spent a couple of years in the
 Android groups there and
 then subsequently did work in other areas and I’ve become
 keenly aware of
 sort of the tension in the marketplace between people who
 are sort of browser
 and web technology centric and people who are mobile cent
ric and I think
 there’s are some really good reasons to worry that the
 notion of the browser is
 losing its centrality in the world of app development.
 And so what I’m going to talk about today is, is that
 really a problem? Is that
 actually happening? And if so, why? And assuming it is
 happening, is that a
 problem that we should worry about? And if it’s a problem
 we should worry about
 then is there anything we could do to improve it? Now this
 is unscheduled but
 I’m also going to take a side trip into privacy. Okay.
 Because I’ve been doing a
 lot of work on that recently and in the era of Ed Snowden,
 you know, we should all
 be worried about that. Yes. You may think you don’t have a
 privacy problem in your work, but you probably do.
 Yeah. Well, I mean, even with services that are very
 popular like HipChat recently, I don’t know if you’re
 familiar with, they had a change in their privacy policy
 when our one-on-one
 chats are able to be exposed to your employer. I mean, even
 things like, like
 that. And when you talk, but to go back to your original
 keynote, when you’re
 talking about browser versus non-browser, are you talking
 about native apps versus…
 Yeah, I’m talking about native apps. Okay. You know,
 increasingly if
 somebody’s going to build an app, they’re actually going to
 build three apps.
 They’re going to build, you know, a browser version, an iOS
 version, an Android

 knows, you know,
 Windows Mobile could get a good foothold and we’d all be
 doing our work four
 times in a row. So right there there’s a problem. And then
 even different form factors. Well, you know,
 that just comes with the game. That’s actually, you know,
 not the big biggest part of the problem. And
 whereas, you know, there’s a lot of advantages to mobile
 apps and people are moving in that
 direction for reasons, some of which are good, you know,
 there’s some downsides to that too.
 And we need to, you know, make sure we understand what the
 upsides and downsides are of having a
 browser-centric worldview as opposed to a native mobile app

 a more easily correct description of a language through XML
 versus kind of a loosey-goosey
 JSON. Is that something maybe that’s indicative of the way
 we’re approaching writing applications
 at this point? Where we’re just like, what is the least
 amount of effort I need to do
 to push data over the wire? Should we be stepping back and
 really thinking more about how we’re
 pushing stuff over the wire? Well, you may be right, but
 that’s okay. I mean, there’s
 so much work to do that we should all be trying to do the
 simplest thing that could possibly work.
 You know, do things in the simplest way that could work.
 Then you worry about your constraints.
 And as regards XML versus JSON, I mean, JSON is clearly,
 clearly superior if you’re exchanging
 database records and file updates and that kind of stuff.
 If you’re exchanging blog posts
 or credit reports or medical health records, XML wins for
 that. So they have different
 areas of strength. But I would worry not so much about the
 form of the content, whether it’s XML or JSON. I’d worry
 about, is it traveling safely across the network in a way
 that somebody who’s using my app can
 be really, really sure that they’re connecting to me, not
 to somebody else, and that nobody
 else can watch the stuff going along? And then having
 established that, sort of the bare
 minimum barrier to entry, then you have to answer questions
 like, okay, if I use your
 app, what information are you gathering about me? How are
 you protecting it? Under what
 conditions will you release it and to whom? And, you know,
 you could write, there’s a real big takeaway
 in letters of fire 50 feet high, and they say, don’t
 surprise me. You know, if you, people are, end up getting
 a nasty surprise about what you’re doing with their data,
 the results will be really bad for you, and you
 won’t say you really want to avoid that.
 All right. Well, thank you very much for taking the time to
 speak with me. I appreciate it.

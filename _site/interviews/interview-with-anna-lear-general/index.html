    "transcript": "User groups with lots to say, interviews and more, no way,\n sharing great ideas in\n the tech community. Fascinating conversations, a plethora\n of information\n find out for yourself today at ugtastic.com. Hi it's Mike\n again with UGtastic.\n Today I'm sitting down with Anna Lear who is a community\n manager with Stack\n Exchange. Stack Exchange is a pretty large site and if you\n're a developer\n you've probably have spent a good deal of time either\n asking questions or\n getting answers from the site. Thanks a lot for sitting\n down with me\n Anna, I really appreciate it. It's good to be here. Thanks,\n can you tell me a little bit\n about what is Stack Exchange overall and what is a\n community manager and how did\n you get involved in that? Sure, well Stack Exchange is by\n now a network of a hundred\n question-and-answer websites. We started out with Stack\n Overflow\n which is a site for programmers of all kinds and pretty\n much any language and\n our basic goal is to provide a place or several places\n where people can come\n with their questions and they can get expert answers on\n whatever topic that\n they happen to be interested in. So as a community manager\n I'm part of a team\n there's about six of us. What we do is we try to work with\n different sites and\n different communities and try to teach them about what\n makes a good Q&A website,\n what kind of things make up sites that are truly helpful.\n So what we usually do\n is we spend a lot of time, well okay let me back up for a\n second, each site\n including Stack Overflow has a corresponding meta site that\n allows its\n community to kind of gather and talk amongst themselves and\n determine how the\n site is going to run and handle different issues that come\n up. So as\n community managers we spend a lot of time monitoring those\n meta sites and\n jumping in to help out with answers and kind of sharing our\n expertise and\n lessons learned over the past several years. What are some\n of these meta sites? What is a meta site?\n It is literally pretty much exactly the same as any main\n site. So\n let's say Stack Overflow on the main site on Stack Overflow\n you will have\n questions about programming you know C#, Java, whatever. On\n the meta site the only\n thing that's on topic is Stack Overflow the site. So people\n would come in with\n questions about why a certain question was closed for\n example or what\n kind of things are on topic. They might want a\n clarification or they might want\n to say well we have a couple different tags that need to be\n merged. Can somebody\n help us out? And that happens basically with every\n community. We provide a way\n for the community to self-govern like that. So it's a way\n to say oh you\n posted this WordPress configuration. Stack Overflow isn't\n the right place to\n do that. Check out wordpress. is it wordpress.stackexchange\n yeah so I mean basically you help redirect people to the\n right place\n potentially yeah if somebody came to Stack Overflow and\n they posted a\n WordPress configuration question and it got well now it's\n put on hold we\n recently rolled out some changes to make closing a little\n nicer but they might\n come to meta and they can they can ask why that happened\n and somebody would say\n hey we have this other site you know your question would be\n more welcome\n there okay\n so you're you're dealing with a lot of developers who are\n maybe dealing with an\n issue and they're trying to get information do you ever\n have to defuse\n any kind of situations or get really angry over a question\n being closed?\n It certainly happens for sure. Our site moderators actually\n take care of a lot of those\n disputes. That's what moderators are there for is to kind\n of keep things\n running smoothly.\n They're all volunteers and they're doing a fantastic job.\n But once in a while we\n as community managers also step in. I don't know that it\n happens a lot but\n there's definitely situations when somebody gets really\n upset and we have\n to be very careful about explaining to them how the site\n works without\n invalidating what they're feeling and invalidating what\n their experience is.\n And so you work with a team of six people? Yeah, that's a\n good question. We have a lot of volunteers and they're all\n volunteers and they're doing a fantastic job. But once in a\n while we as community managers also step in. I don't know\n that it happens a lot but there's definitely situations\n when somebody gets really upset and we have to be very\n careful about explaining to them how the site works without\n invalidating what their feeling and invalidating what their\n experience is.\n And so you you work with a team of six people and you\n mostly interact through\n Meta or do you work with the moderators?\n Um, yes to both. So we make heavy use of chat rooms. So\n Stack Overflow and Stack\n Exchange has a chat system as well. So we have internal\n chat rooms that we use\n within the team and across the teams at Stack Exchange and\n we also have\n moderator-only chat rooms where we talk to moderators and\n kind of provide more\n real-time interaction. So and as far as as the kind of\n information you're\n probably seeing, I'm just curious, has there ever been, as\n you're going in and\n moderating things, I mean I'm sure there's some of the\n questions where you're\n like, \"Why are people asking this? Don't they read the FAQ\n?\"\n But, as you're going in and moderating things, I'm sure\n there's some of the questions where you're like, \"Why are\n people asking this? Don't they read the FAQ?\"\n But, as you're going in and moderating things, I'm sure\n there's some of the questions where you're like, \"Why are\n people asking this?

Don't they read the FAQ?\"\n But, as you're going in and moderating things, I'm sure\n there's some of the questions where you're like, \"Why are\n people asking this? Don't they read the FAQ?\"\n oh no that was one oh um\n yeah this is not going to be helpful something on stack\n overflow that\n ended up talking about railroads oh really i think\n yeah well now yeah now watch somebody try and find it and\n it's going to be something\n completely different but uh yeah no nothing that's off the\n top of my head that i can like\n point to right now just maybe is there so much information\n that you have to troll through\n to to to manage that it's not much that you can actually\n read\n uh pretty much yeah i mean i don't spend a lot of my time\n um anymore unfortunately uh\n like actually browsing stack overflow and reading questions\n for kind of personal\n um enjoyment uh most of the things i end up seeing right\n now are actually\n problematic in some way uh somebody emailed us\n to get\n support or i'm responding to a flag um for moderator\n attention or something like that\n so i end up seeing a lot of kind of average type stuff once\n in a while though i mean i still i\n still watch like hacker news and all that kind of stuff so\n great questions still happen and uh\n they get promoted in those ways yeah and um\n as far as dealing with people that are uh looking at trying\n to get their you know\n again with the questions trying to be answered uh\n are there any myths that you've run into where people\n make assumptions like i know on reddit people often get\n angry at the mods and\n there's occasionally moderator revolts where they try to\n take down a moderator who people disagree with uh how they\n're how they're\n uh how a moderator decided a certain set of questions\n should or posts should be\n handled or changed rules uh is there any uh has there been\n anything like that that you've been\n struck at with stack exchange where you've you've had\n people directly come in conflict with a\n moderator or question oh definitely definitely uh there's\n many many examples on metastack overflow\n of that um one that uh kind of sticks in mind uh is um not\n the last moderator election but the one\n before it i think uh we elected four moderators um and uh\n one of them i think at the time he was 19\n and uh somebody and i think he closed the question i don't\n exactly remember the specifics anymore\n but somebody came to meta and basically wrote this giant\n rant about how teenage moderators are\n ruining stack overflow and it is the worst thing that has\n ever happened so it was basically like\n he picked specifically on that moderator and um things just\n went downhill from there it was\n interesting you mentioned moderator moderator elections how\n does that work uh so about once a\n year uh\n give or take uh we run moderator elections so what happens\n is all of our moderators are volunteers\n uh and um when the site when a site is still in public beta\n um i should probably explain that too\n so when somebody before we create a new site in the network\n um we work uh from a list of site\n proposals uh that are brought to us by anybody on the\n internet uh we have a special site for that\n area 51 uh we have a special site for that area 51 uh we\n have a special site for that area 51\n um and once a proposal uh gathers a certain uh number of\n followers and people who kind of commit\n to making that site a reality uh that site goes into a\n private beta for about a week to kind of\n hash out the immediate issues and whatnot and then it goes\n into a public beta and during that time\n it's open to anybody anybody can participate and for that\n period we appoint moderators based on a\n few criteria people who were active early in the site who\n kind of showed aptitude uh for community\n moderation but once the site graduates from public beta uh\n we hold moderator elections uh so this\n gives the opportunity uh for any community members uh who\n are interested to nominate themselves uh and\n kind of you know basically they they come back come forth\n with their platform and kind of explain\n how they want to make the site better what you know what\n attracts them uh to being a moderator\n what they like about the site and uh then people vote for\n them and uh you know\n um and then people vote for them and uh you know and then\n people vote for them and uh you know\n uh so we have an entire system built for that it's\n basically um open stv um i don't know that\n so it's um oh man the way it works is uh somewhat\n complicated and i can never quite remember that\n there's a meta post on how exactly the votes are counted\n but it's basically people pick their top\n three um picks and then um the first there's a count of\n like first votes um that a person\n gets and then once they hit a threshold they're elected and\n then like other votes that are cast\n for them trickle down to other people and yeah possibly not\n too familiar with that it's it's it's\n i'm not gonna be able to explain it well but it's basically\n sounds like you have three candidates\n and then you vote there's a way to hash out which one\n actually got the most votes of the three\n candidates uh i'll link to it in the show notes and then i\n'll link to it in the show notes and then\n i'll link to it in the show notes because i'm not from aust\nralia i just know that it's been\n explained to me by an australian uh that's how it worked um\n so um okay so you know just uh to\n speak personally about you how did you get involved with\n stack exchange uh so i mean you\n talked about how moderators get elected but how how did the\n community manager position\n evolve and and how did you end up becoming one well how it\n evolved\n is slightly before my time um from what i know uh robert\n cartano uh he's our director of community\n development uh he was the first community manager that\n stack exchange uh ever had and um all i know\n about that is that at some point he was approached by jeff\n atwood and they worked something out\n which is basically how pretty much everything i believe got\n uh done in those days um\n but uh eventually you know the team grew uh by the time i\n got to it uh i'm a software developer by trade uh so i\n joined stack overflow um didn't really spend\n a lot of time on it uh but when programmers stack exchange\n launched uh i kind of really got into\n that and um it was um it was it was somewhat controversial\n uh at the time it uh it was\n proposed as a place where everything that's off topic on\n stack overflow\n can live and that really didn't work uh it just really\n created a terrible site\n uh and eventually\n it evolved you know and it and now it became kind of you\n know the the whiteboard side of stack\n overflow where you can kind of hash out you know software\n practices and design all that kind of\n stuff but anyway um i was elected a moderator on\n programmers so i nominated in the first election\n and ran um and from there i just discovered kind of the\n rest of the network um and i spent more\n and more time on metas uh and uh i eventually went back to\n stack overflow and became a moderator on\n stack overflow\n and from there i got the job\n is everybody on the community manager team coming through a\n similar path or\n um not necessarily uh unfortunately she's no longer with us\n but we had um um a community\n manager earthy uh who did not have a developer background\n uh she uh got on the team through an\n internal um arrangement uh i think right now everybody on\n the team has some sort of development\n past okay so at the moment i'm not sure if i'm going to be\n able to do that but i'm going to\n everybody has a little bit of uh skin in the game so to\n speak of yeah understanding what what is\n being talked about and a concept of what is what is the the\n um spirit of the of the conversation on\n on stack exchange because it's people who are marketing\n experts it's people who are developers\n who are passionate about these topics and are good at\n working with a lot of people well on stack\n overflow for sure\n um i mean we have we have a lot of sites uh on topics that\n aren't really developer oriented\n uh we have a site about cooking photography uh video games\n you know all that kind of stuff\n uh there's definitely sites where none of us have any\n experience with whatsoever uh but a lot but\n most of the lessons that we've learned from stack overflow\n and from other sites they really just\n translate across the board so okay well thank you very much\n for taking the time to sit down\n with me i really appreciate it thank you\n you",

 sharing great ideas in
 the tech community. Fascinating conversations, a plethora
 of information
 find out for yourself today at ugtastic.com. Hi it’s Mike
 again with UGtastic.
 Today I’m sitting down with Anna Lear who is a community
 manager with Stack
 Exchange. Stack Exchange is a pretty large site and if you
‘re a developer
 you’ve probably have spent a good deal of time either
 asking questions or
 getting answers from the site. Thanks a lot for sitting
 down with me
 Anna, I really appreciate it. It’s good to be here. Thanks,
 can you tell me a little bit
 about what is Stack Exchange overall and what is a
 community manager and how did
 you get involved in that? Sure, well Stack Exchange is by
 now a network of a hundred
 question-and-answer websites. We started out with Stack
 Overflow
 which is a site for programmers of all kinds and pretty
 much any language and
 our basic goal is to provide a place or several places
 where people can come
 with their questions and they can get expert answers on
 whatever topic that
 they happen to be interested in. So as a community manager
 I’m part of a team
 there’s about six of us. What we do is we try to work with
 different sites and
 different communities and try to teach them about what
 makes a good Q&amp;A website,
 what kind of things make up sites that are truly helpful.
 So what we usually do
 is we spend a lot of time, well okay let me back up for a
 second, each site
 including Stack Overflow has a corresponding meta site that
 allows its
 community to kind of gather and talk amongst themselves and
 determine how the
 site is going to run and handle different issues that come
 up. So as
 community managers we spend a lot of time monitoring those
 meta sites and
 jumping in to help out with answers and kind of sharing our
 expertise and
 lessons learned over the past several years. What are some
 of these meta sites? What is a meta site?
 It is literally pretty much exactly the same as any main
 site. So
 let’s say Stack Overflow on the main site on Stack Overflow
 you will have
 questions about programming you know C#, Java, whatever. On
 the meta site the only
 thing that’s on topic is Stack Overflow the site. So people
 would come in with
 questions about why a certain question was closed for
 example or what
 kind of things are on topic. They might want a
 clarification or they might want
 to say well we have a couple different tags that need to be
 merged. Can somebody
 help us out? And that happens basically with every
 community. We provide a way
 for the community to self-govern like that. So it’s a way
 to say oh you
 posted this WordPress configuration. Stack Overflow isn’t
 the right place to
 do that. Check out wordpress. is it wordpress.stackexchange
 yeah so I mean basically you help redirect people to the
 right place
 potentially yeah if somebody came to Stack Overflow and
 they posted a
 WordPress configuration question and it got well now it’s
 put on hold we
 recently rolled out some changes to make closing a little
 nicer but they might
 come to meta and they can they can ask why that happened
 and somebody would say
 hey we have this other site you know your question would be
 more welcome
 there okay
 so you’re you’re dealing with a lot of developers who are
 maybe dealing with an
 issue and they’re trying to get information do you ever
 have to defuse
 any kind of situations or get really angry over a question
 being closed?
 It certainly happens for sure. Our site moderators actually
 take care of a lot of those
 disputes. That’s what moderators are there for is to kind
 of keep things
 running smoothly.
 They’re all volunteers and they’re doing a fantastic job.
 But once in a while we
 as community managers also step in. I don’t know that it
 happens a lot but
 there’s definitely situations when somebody gets really
 upset and we have
 to be very careful about explaining to them how the site
 works without
 invalidating what they’re feeling and invalidating what
 their experience is.
 And so you work with a team of six people? Yeah, that’s a
 good question. We have a lot of volunteers and they’re all
 volunteers and they’re doing a fantastic job. But once in a
 while we as community managers also step in. I don’t know
 that it happens a lot but there’s definitely situations
 when somebody gets really upset and we have to be very
 careful about explaining to them how the site works without
 invalidating what their feeling and invalidating what their
 experience is.
 And so you you work with a team of six people and you
 mostly interact through
 Meta or do you work with the moderators?
 Um, yes to both. So we make heavy use of chat rooms. So
 Stack Overflow and Stack
 Exchange has a chat system as well. So we have internal
 chat rooms that we use
 within the team and across the teams at Stack Exchange and
 we also have
 moderator-only chat rooms where we talk to moderators and
 kind of provide more
 real-time interaction. So and as far as as the kind of
 information you’re
 probably seeing, I’m just curious, has there ever been, as
 you’re going in and
 moderating things, I mean I’m sure there’s some of the
 questions where you’re
 like, “Why are people asking this? Don’t they read the FAQ
?”
 But, as you’re going in and moderating things, I’m sure
 there’s some of the questions where you’re like, “Why are

 oh no that was one oh um
 yeah this is not going to be helpful something on stack
 overflow that
 ended up talking about railroads oh really i think
 yeah well now yeah now watch somebody try and find it and
 it’s going to be something
 completely different but uh yeah no nothing that’s off the
 top of my head that i can like
 point to right now just maybe is there so much information
 that you have to troll through
 to to to manage that it’s not much that you can actually
 read
 uh pretty much yeah i mean i don’t spend a lot of my time
 um anymore unfortunately uh
 like actually browsing stack overflow and reading questions
 for kind of personal
 um enjoyment uh most of the things i end up seeing right
 now are actually
 problematic in some way uh somebody emailed us
 to get
 support or i’m responding to a flag um for moderator
 attention or something like that
 so i end up seeing a lot of kind of average type stuff once
 in a while though i mean i still i
 still watch like hacker news and all that kind of stuff so
 great questions still happen and uh
 they get promoted in those ways yeah and um
 as far as dealing with people that are uh looking at trying
 to get their you know
 again with the questions trying to be answered uh
 are there any myths that you’ve run into where people
 make assumptions like i know on reddit people often get
 angry at the mods and
 there’s occasionally moderator revolts where they try to
 take down a moderator who people disagree with uh how they
‘re how they’re
 uh how a moderator decided a certain set of questions
 should or posts should be
 handled or changed rules uh is there any uh has there been
 anything like that that you’ve been
 struck at with stack exchange where you’ve you’ve had
 people directly come in conflict with a
 moderator or question oh definitely definitely uh there’s
 many many examples on metastack overflow
 of that um one that uh kind of sticks in mind uh is um not
 the last moderator election but the one
 before it i think uh we elected four moderators um and uh
 one of them i think at the time he was 19
 and uh somebody and i think he closed the question i don’t
 exactly remember the specifics anymore
 but somebody came to meta and basically wrote this giant
 rant about how teenage moderators are
 ruining stack overflow and it is the worst thing that has
 ever happened so it was basically like
 he picked specifically on that moderator and um things just
 went downhill from there it was
 interesting you mentioned moderator moderator elections how
 does that work uh so about once a
 year uh
 give or take uh we run moderator elections so what happens
 is all of our moderators are volunteers
 uh and um when the site when a site is still in public beta
 um i should probably explain that too
 so when somebody before we create a new site in the network
 um we work uh from a list of site
 proposals uh that are brought to us by anybody on the
 internet uh we have a special site for that
 area 51 uh we have a special site for that area 51 uh we
 have a special site for that area 51
 um and once a proposal uh gathers a certain uh number of
 followers and people who kind of commit
 to making that site a reality uh that site goes into a
 private beta for about a week to kind of
 hash out the immediate issues and whatnot and then it goes
 into a public beta and during that time
 it’s open to anybody anybody can participate and for that
 period we appoint moderators based on a
 few criteria people who were active early in the site who
 kind of showed aptitude uh for community
 moderation but once the site graduates from public beta uh
 we hold moderator elections uh so this
 gives the opportunity uh for any community members uh who
 are interested to nominate themselves uh and
 kind of you know basically they they come back come forth
 with their platform and kind of explain
 how they want to make the site better what you know what
 attracts them uh to being a moderator
 what they like about the site and uh then people vote for
 them and uh you know
 um and then people vote for them and uh you know and then
 people vote for them and uh you know
 uh so we have an entire system built for that it’s
 basically um open stv um i don’t know that
 so it’s um oh man the way it works is uh somewhat
 complicated and i can never quite remember that
 there’s a meta post on how exactly the votes are counted
 but it’s basically people pick their top
 three um picks and then um the first there’s a count of
 like first votes um that a person
 gets and then once they hit a threshold they’re elected and
 then like other votes that are cast
 for them trickle down to other people and yeah possibly not
 too familiar with that it’s it’s it’s
 i’m not gonna be able to explain it well but it’s basically
 sounds like you have three candidates
 and then you vote there’s a way to hash out which one
 actually got the most votes of the three
 candidates uh i’ll link to it in the show notes and then i
‘ll link to it in the show notes and then
 i’ll link to it in the show notes because i’m not from aust
ralia i just know that it’s been
 explained to me by an australian uh that’s how it worked um
 so um okay so you know just uh to
 speak personally about you how did you get involved with
 stack exchange uh so i mean you
 talked about how moderators get elected but how how did the
 community manager position
 evolve and and how did you end up becoming one well how it
 evolved
 is slightly before my time um from what i know uh robert
 cartano uh he’s our director of community
 development uh he was the first community manager that
 stack exchange uh ever had and um all i know
 about that is that at some point he was approached by jeff
 atwood and they worked something out
 which is basically how pretty much everything i believe got
 uh done in those days um
 but uh eventually you know the team grew uh by the time i
 got to it uh i’m a software developer by trade uh so i
 joined stack overflow um didn’t really spend
 a lot of time on it uh but when programmers stack exchange
 launched uh i kind of really got into
 that and um it was um it was it was somewhat controversial
 uh at the time it uh it was
 proposed as a place where everything that’s off topic on
 stack overflow
 can live and that really didn’t work uh it just really
 created a terrible site
 uh and eventually
 it evolved you know and it and now it became kind of you
 know the the whiteboard side of stack
 overflow where you can kind of hash out you know software
 practices and design all that kind of
 stuff but anyway um i was elected a moderator on
 programmers so i nominated in the first election
 and ran um and from there i just discovered kind of the
 rest of the network um and i spent more
 and more time on metas uh and uh i eventually went back to
 stack overflow and became a moderator on
 stack overflow
 and from there i got the job
 is everybody on the community manager team coming through a
 similar path or
 um not necessarily uh unfortunately she’s no longer with us
 but we had um um a community
 manager earthy uh who did not have a developer background
 uh she uh got on the team through an
 internal um arrangement uh i think right now everybody on
 the team has some sort of development
 past okay so at the moment i’m not sure if i’m going to be
 able to do that but i’m going to
 everybody has a little bit of uh skin in the game so to
 speak of yeah understanding what what is
 being talked about and a concept of what is what is the the
 um spirit of the of the conversation on
 on stack exchange because it’s people who are marketing
 experts it’s people who are developers
 who are passionate about these topics and are good at
 working with a lot of people well on stack
 overflow for sure
 um i mean we have we have a lot of sites uh on topics that
 aren’t really developer oriented
 uh we have a site about cooking photography uh video games
 you know all that kind of stuff
 uh there’s definitely sites where none of us have any
 experience with whatsoever uh but a lot but
 most of the lessons that we’ve learned from stack overflow
 and from other sites they really just
 translate across the board so okay well thank you very much
 for taking the time to sit down
 with me i really appreciate it thank you
 you</p>

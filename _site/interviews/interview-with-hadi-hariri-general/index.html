    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike Hall again here with Utesic. Today I'm coming\n from the GOTO Conf in Chicago,\n GOTO Chicago. I'm sitting down with Hadi Hariri, who is a\n developer evangelist with JetBrain,\n and one of the talks he was going to be giving today is on\n being an antisocial geek is harmful.\n Which, I think, is actually very thematic for what Utesic\n is, and it's trying to support\n people who participate in the community and get out from\n behind the desks. So, thank you\n again for sitting down with me. What is an antisocial geek,\n if we don't already know\n what it is, and why is it harmful?\n So, there's, you know, there's easy, there's an easy way to\n get a talk.\n It's not that anti, that we're antisocial. I mean, if you\n define antisocial as someone\n that wants to disrupt and be aggressive towards others and\n their rights, we're not. We're\n not antisocial. We're antisocial in the sense of we're not\n really, you know, into socializing\n as much as other people.\n It's not misanthropic, it's just going for it.\n A little bit, yeah. So, the talk is more about\n communication and interaction.\n Right? And it's more about the experience that I've had\n over the 20 plus years of interacting\n with different developers, with different teams, having run\n my own company and seeing\n the problems that communication or lack of it causes\n between developers and teams. And\n it's, you know, often you find, like, in our industry, it's\n become common to say that developers\n are introverts. Developers, you know, don't, don't mind him\n, you know, Steve is great at\n developing but you can't really talk to him.\n Right.\n And I think that we are ignoring this and we're kind of\n accepting that you can't\n talk to Steve.\n Right.\n As opposed to trying to find out why you can't talk to\n Steve. Find out why you can't\n talk to certain people or why there's so much friction when\n you're talking to certain people.\n And what happens is that we end up with teams where certain\n people, certain individuals\n are isolated.\n Mm-hmm.\n And that, I, I feel that impacts the team, it impacts the,\n the code, it impacts\n the company, it impacts the goals, everything.\n Mm-hmm.\n And just happiness.\n Happiness.\n That you're kind of pigeonholed into this, you're a\n developer therefore you don't\n want to talk to anybody. You're a developer therefore you\n just want to sit in a dark room.\n And it, some, I've seen this culture of we all sit in a\n dark room and nobody talks. And\n then we all go out to lunch and then everybody just chat,\n chat, chat, chat.\n Mm-hmm.\n Which kind of leads me to believe is that people actually\n do want to talk and they\n do want to share. But we have this stigma or this preconce\nived notion the way we're\n supposed to act.\n Yeah, I mean we're, we're great. I mean it's not that, you\n know, it's a myth that\n developers are introverts. They're not introverts. What,\n what we don't like, and I've discussed\n this in my other talk, the Prima Donovan that I talk about,\n is that we don't like small\n talk.\n Mm-hmm.\n And when I, the first time I said that to me, gave that\n talk, someone said to me, \"What\n do you have against the language small talk?\"\n No.\n It just proved my point.\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n It's like, yeah, come on, right?\n Yeah, exactly.\n Uh, we don't like small talk. So we, we love to debate. We\n love to just sit there\n and, you know, debate things on end and bring out points\n and make sure that we have the last\n point and we're right. Sometimes we don't realize that it,\n it's time to back off. Sometimes\n we don't realize that it doesn't matter of, you know,\n making a concise point about something.\n Mm-hmm.\n It's, we, we miss the big picture.\n Right. And it, it's, I, I kind of feel it's these skills\n that often we're lacking.\n Yeah.\n Right? Because we, you know, like I, I think that it's very\n good for developers to work\n in technical support.\n Mm-hmm.\n Because you learn to deal with customers. You learn to know\n when to back off. You know\n when to concede, to say, \"Okay, well, you're wrong, but I'm\n not gonna tell you you're wrong\n because of this.\"\n Right. Because it's, in the end, it's just not worth the\n battle.\n It's not worth the battle. And what happens is that with\n teams, when you're\n in, when you're with someone that is constantly trying to\n prove his point, it ends up that\n you're just like, \"Okay, well, just do whatever you want.\"\n You know? And that do whatever\n you want can impact your product. It can impact your,\n whatever you're developing. But you're\n like, \"Well, it's not worth the friction to, to dispute or\n debate with this guy.\"\n Mm-hmm. Okay.\n And there's a lot of people that don't realize that at some\n point it's, it's better\n to back off. It's better to, you know, again, not miss the,\n the, the point that we're making.\n That's what we're trying to do. Right? What, what is it\n that we're, we're here for?\n Yeah. Recently, myself, I've, I had to work in a non-\ndeveloper role and getting\n to see, most dealing with HR people, and getting to see how\n different, because what you described\n about the way developers tend to talk when we're amongst\n other developers, and then going\n into human resources where it's very much not as, as rigid\n as development. They have\n their rules and they have their protocols, but the, the\n mode of conversation is much\n different, much more, I don't want to say casual, but it,\n it, it is different. And I'm,\n I'm struggling to figure out how to.\n It is because, you know, we are, we, we, we try and apply\n our coding principles to our\n conversations.\n Yeah.\n Like, \"Dry.\" Yes. \"Oh, I, why do I have to review myself?\"\n Or, \"Say the minimum\n possible for it to be efficient,\" you know, like, \"Ultimate\n efficiency when we see\n what we speak.\" And sometimes it's not about efficiency,\n right? Sometimes it truly is about\n talking about the weather or some nonsense or whatever to\n break the ice, to, to try and\n understand the other person, right? And, and that's one\n other thing that I feel that is\n lacking a little bit in the developer world, which is conve\nying emotions. Like, you know,\n we don't have a lot of empathy often, right?\n Mm-hmm.\n I mean, you've seen, no doubt, you've been involved in open\n source, right? And recently\n there was some, some lady that had put up some code on open\n source, and there was such\n a backslash, backlash on it on Twitter. Like, who would put\n up rubbish like this? And when\n you get high-profile people putting things like that, it\n hurts people. And we don't think\n about these things. You know, we don't think about how our\n actions in the goal of saying\n that something is right or wrong can end up hurting other\n people.\n Yeah. And it's kind of interesting how you, how you are\n describing the, the, you know,\n I, I don't want to say lack of empathy, but it sounds like\n more of a underused empathy\n muscle.\n Yeah.\n That, you know, we, we can relate to each other, but we\n haven't, many of us haven't\n developed that, that, that skill dealing with other people.\n In, in, in a, in a more benign\n way, I'm thinking of, in the HR role I've, I've had is\n working with developers as they're\n onboarding. They're trying to get...\n Right.\n ...people who've only been at a company under seven months\n or so, to talk to somebody who's\n starting today. And when I'm talking to the person who's,\n you know, only six, seven months\n there, they think, well, I don't know enough to be able to\n give useful information to this\n person. And I don't want to say it's a lack of empathy, but\n they, they don't remember\n how to empathize with what it was like to be that new\n person, and realize that they\n do have a lot of experience that they could share that\n could be useful for that, that\n person. And it's, it's, they can't put themselves back in\n that role of not knowing.\n Yeah.\n It's like, like as adults, we forget what it's like to be a\n child. It's, if you're a\n parent, it's, it's hard sometimes to remember. But it's, it\n's an, it's a, it's an empathy\n deficit.\n Yeah.\n It seems like. Now, as a developer evangelist, you have to\n deal with a lot of people, I'm\n sure.\n Yeah.\n So, you know, dealing with communities, has your, has that,\n has this view that you're\n having now, and where this talk came from, and, and even\n the Prima Donna's talk, you,\n you, you mentioned earlier, is that coming from your\n experiences largely dealing with\n so many varied communities, .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby,\n JavaScript, Python?\n Well, yeah, but I mean, I'm, you know, I'm not going to bad\nmouth the developer community\n far from it, because I'm still a developer myself.\n Right.\n But I, I feel that there is a little bit of a lacking. I\n mean, I, you know, I, I, I'm,\n I work at, I, I work at a lot of conferences, and I stand\n at a lot of booths, and I see\n that it's very, often it's hard to engage conversation with\n, with people, because people\n are shy to come up and say, you know, like, what do you do,\n or whatever. And so, I have\n found it, but, but more than in, as a, and as an evangelist\n coming across this, I, it's\n been more my experience with, with teams that I've worked\n with, or teams that I've worked\n on. Right? And it's more about the, the actual root\n problems that, often, they're, they're\n having in, in teams. And I've, I've learned to deal with\n people more openly, and be kind\n of like, you know, more open in that, a lot when I was\n dealing with customers.\n Okay.\n I mean, when I had to talk to customers, and, and that's\n why I say, I mean, customer\n support is, is one of the best things that developers\n should do. I mean, I have had to\n deal with customers, you know, doing technical support in\n ISP, where, you know, the guy would\n call and say, I can't send email, and he would say, are you\n connected to the internet? And\n I'm like, I don't want to go to the internet, I want to\n send email, right? You have to learn\n to deal with that.\n Yeah.\n And it gives you patience, and it teaches you how to talk\n to people, because you can't\n hang up the phone and say, you're, you're too stupid to\n send the email.\n Right.\n You can't.\n Well, and, and the thing is, is, again, it goes to the\n empathy, remembering that once\n upon a time, you were in the same boat, you know, you may\n have been a child when it happened,\n but once upon a time, you did not know what the internet\n was. And, and, and trying to\n remember. One, you know, this, this reminds me of, you know\n, I, I, you know, I've been,\n of a, a scenario I'd experienced in the military, where I\n was dealing with a bunch of new recruits\n and asking them where they, which, which jobs they were\n going to be taking. And, of course,\n you know, one was a medic, and one was going to go to\n language school, and one was going\n to be in, an MP, and the other one was, kind of, said, I'm\n just going to be a truck driver.\n And it kind of took me back. She was, she was really like,\n eh, you know, I'm not as\n good as these other people.\n And, you just, not, she also, like, kind of, from the other\n end, forgot that she was going\n to be providing a very valuable service, and that what she\n was doing was important, and\n that she was a human being, and, and had value. And, and\n when we're looking at our, you know,\n ivory towers, we have these very fancy jobs, we're senior\n engineers, and we're, we have\n these very illustrious titles, and we forget that we couldn\n't have that without the truck\n driver, who carries the computers.\n That we're all part of this. If that customer didn't call\n in and say, I want to send email,\n I don't want to get on the internet. If it wasn't for that\n person, then we wouldn't even,\n we wouldn't even be able to exist. You know, much like the\n truck driver, you couldn't even\n have an infantry without having the trucker who could bring\n the stuff, the supplies.\n All the factory work, all that puts the chips together on\n the computer that you're using\n every day. It's every, every.\n And it's, though we, it's just, it's part of an ecosystem,\n you know, that, that, you\n remember that, maybe you might, I don't want to say humble,\n but just be more aware that\n Well, I definitely think there's, you know, there is that,\n that missing in, in the developer\n community. I think we need, we all need to be a little bit\n more humble. We all need to\n come down, back down to earth and think about what we are\n doing as part of the global picture\n as opposed to our personal goals. And there was an article\n recently, in fact, on, I think\n it was on Forbes.\n Or somewhere about whether we are the, they were putting a\n comparison of, are we the Lindsay\n Lohan or are we the Meryl Streep of the, of Hollywood, you\n know, as opposed to are we in\n this startup business of getting venture capitalists and\n cashing out quick, or are we there to try\n and really change the world and grow up a business and grow\n it steadily? And I often\n find that we're kind of more moving towards that big, you\n know, hotshot Hollywood kind\n of thing, right?\n Well, yeah, it's, it's the...\n The, the, the, the rock star, the ninja.\n Yeah, the ninja, the rock star.\n Yeah, yeah. It's very fancy.\n It's all, it's all that.\n It's all that.\n And it's again, that's, that desire to put ourselves up on,\n on, on a higher pedestal\n instead of realizing, okay, we're, we're part of an\n ecosystem that, you know, we, we can't\n do these things without each other.\n And that's one of the reasons that I wanted to support and,\n and make user group organizers\n and conference organizers, the people that bring people\n together, that's one of the reasons\n is to help expose them, to support, to support the people\n that build the community and, and\n realize that we're in this kind of together and it's more\n fun to do it together than to\n do it alone.\n Everyone plays a role.\n Everyone is important.\n Yes.\n Well, thank you very much for taking the time to stay with\n me.\n Thank you.\n I really appreciate it.\n It was a pleasure.\n Pleasure having you.\n Thank you.\n Sorry.\n Oh.\n Thank you.\n Thank you.\n Thank you.\n Thank you.\n Thank you.\n Thank you.",

 It’s not that anti, that we’re antisocial. I mean, if you
 define antisocial as someone
 that wants to disrupt and be aggressive towards others and
 their rights, we’re not. We’re
 not antisocial. We’re antisocial in the sense of we’re not
 really, you know, into socializing
 as much as other people.
 It’s not misanthropic, it’s just going for it.
 A little bit, yeah. So, the talk is more about
 communication and interaction.
 Right? And it’s more about the experience that I’ve had
 over the 20 plus years of interacting
 with different developers, with different teams, having run
 my own company and seeing
 the problems that communication or lack of it causes
 between developers and teams. And
 it’s, you know, often you find, like, in our industry, it’s
 become common to say that developers
 are introverts. Developers, you know, don’t, don’t mind him
, you know, Steve is great at
 developing but you can’t really talk to him.
 Right.
 And I think that we are ignoring this and we’re kind of
 accepting that you can’t
 talk to Steve.
 Right.
 As opposed to trying to find out why you can’t talk to
 Steve. Find out why you can’t
 talk to certain people or why there’s so much friction when
 you’re talking to certain people.
 And what happens is that we end up with teams where certain
 people, certain individuals
 are isolated.
 Mm-hmm.
 And that, I, I feel that impacts the team, it impacts the,
 the code, it impacts
 the company, it impacts the goals, everything.
 Mm-hmm.
 And just happiness.
 Happiness.
 That you’re kind of pigeonholed into this, you’re a
 developer therefore you don’t
 want to talk to anybody. You’re a developer therefore you
 just want to sit in a dark room.
 And it, some, I’ve seen this culture of we all sit in a
 dark room and nobody talks. And
 then we all go out to lunch and then everybody just chat,
 chat, chat, chat.
 Mm-hmm.
 Which kind of leads me to believe is that people actually
 do want to talk and they
 do want to share. But we have this stigma or this preconce
ived notion the way we’re
 supposed to act.
 Yeah, I mean we’re, we’re great. I mean it’s not that, you
 know, it’s a myth that
 developers are introverts. They’re not introverts. What,
 what we don’t like, and I’ve discussed
 this in my other talk, the Prima Donovan that I talk about,
 is that we don’t like small
 talk.
 Mm-hmm.
 And when I, the first time I said that to me, gave that
 talk, someone said to me, “What
 do you have against the language small talk?”
 No.
 It just proved my point.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 It’s like, yeah, come on, right?
 Yeah, exactly.
 Uh, we don’t like small talk. So we, we love to debate. We
 love to just sit there
 and, you know, debate things on end and bring out points
 and make sure that we have the last
 point and we’re right. Sometimes we don’t realize that it,
 it’s time to back off. Sometimes
 we don’t realize that it doesn’t matter of, you know,
 making a concise point about something.
 Mm-hmm.
 It’s, we, we miss the big picture.
 Right. And it, it’s, I, I kind of feel it’s these skills
 that often we’re lacking.
 Yeah.
 Right? Because we, you know, like I, I think that it’s very
 good for developers to work
 in technical support.
 Mm-hmm.
 Because you learn to deal with customers. You learn to know
 when to back off. You know
 when to concede, to say, “Okay, well, you’re wrong, but I’m
 not gonna tell you you’re wrong
 because of this.”
 Right. Because it’s, in the end, it’s just not worth the
 battle.
 It’s not worth the battle. And what happens is that with
 teams, when you’re
 in, when you’re with someone that is constantly trying to
 prove his point, it ends up that
 you’re just like, “Okay, well, just do whatever you want.”
 You know? And that do whatever
 you want can impact your product. It can impact your,
 whatever you’re developing. But you’re
 like, “Well, it’s not worth the friction to, to dispute or
 debate with this guy.”
 Mm-hmm. Okay.
 And there’s a lot of people that don’t realize that at some
 point it’s, it’s better
 to back off. It’s better to, you know, again, not miss the,
 the, the point that we’re making.
 That’s what we’re trying to do. Right? What, what is it
 that we’re, we’re here for?
 Yeah. Recently, myself, I’ve, I had to work in a non-
developer role and getting
 to see, most dealing with HR people, and getting to see how
 different, because what you described
 about the way developers tend to talk when we’re amongst
 other developers, and then going
 into human resources where it’s very much not as, as rigid
 as development. They have
 their rules and they have their protocols, but the, the
 mode of conversation is much
 different, much more, I don’t want to say casual, but it,
 it, it is different. And I’m,
 I’m struggling to figure out how to.
 It is because, you know, we are, we, we, we try and apply
 our coding principles to our
 conversations.
 Yeah.
 Like, “Dry.” Yes. “Oh, I, why do I have to review myself?”
 Or, “Say the minimum
 possible for it to be efficient,” you know, like, “Ultimate
 efficiency when we see
 what we speak.” And sometimes it’s not about efficiency,
 right? Sometimes it truly is about
 talking about the weather or some nonsense or whatever to
 break the ice, to, to try and
 understand the other person, right? And, and that’s one
 other thing that I feel that is
 lacking a little bit in the developer world, which is conve
ying emotions. Like, you know,
 we don’t have a lot of empathy often, right?
 Mm-hmm.
 I mean, you’ve seen, no doubt, you’ve been involved in open
 source, right? And recently
 there was some, some lady that had put up some code on open
 source, and there was such
 a backslash, backlash on it on Twitter. Like, who would put
 up rubbish like this? And when
 you get high-profile people putting things like that, it
 hurts people. And we don’t think
 about these things. You know, we don’t think about how our
 actions in the goal of saying
 that something is right or wrong can end up hurting other
 people.
 Yeah. And it’s kind of interesting how you, how you are
 describing the, the, you know,
 I, I don’t want to say lack of empathy, but it sounds like
 more of a underused empathy
 muscle.
 Yeah.
 That, you know, we, we can relate to each other, but we
 haven’t, many of us haven’t
 developed that, that, that skill dealing with other people.
 In, in, in a, in a more benign
 way, I’m thinking of, in the HR role I’ve, I’ve had is
 working with developers as they’re
 onboarding. They’re trying to get…
 Right.
 …people who’ve only been at a company under seven months
 or so, to talk to somebody who’s
 starting today. And when I’m talking to the person who’s,
 you know, only six, seven months
 there, they think, well, I don’t know enough to be able to
 give useful information to this
 person. And I don’t want to say it’s a lack of empathy, but
 they, they don’t remember
 how to empathize with what it was like to be that new
 person, and realize that they
 do have a lot of experience that they could share that
 could be useful for that, that
 person. And it’s, it’s, they can’t put themselves back in
 that role of not knowing.
 Yeah.
 It’s like, like as adults, we forget what it’s like to be a
 child. It’s, if you’re a
 parent, it’s, it’s hard sometimes to remember. But it’s, it
‘s an, it’s a, it’s an empathy
 deficit.
 Yeah.
 It seems like. Now, as a developer evangelist, you have to
 deal with a lot of people, I’m
 sure.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, dealing with communities, has your, has that,
 has this view that you’re
 having now, and where this talk came from, and, and even
 the Prima Donna’s talk, you,
 you, you mentioned earlier, is that coming from your
 experiences largely dealing with
 so many varied communities, .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby,
 JavaScript, Python?
 Well, yeah, but I mean, I’m, you know, I’m not going to bad
mouth the developer community
 far from it, because I’m still a developer myself.
 Right.
 But I, I feel that there is a little bit of a lacking. I
 mean, I, you know, I, I, I’m,
 I work at, I, I work at a lot of conferences, and I stand
 at a lot of booths, and I see
 that it’s very, often it’s hard to engage conversation with
, with people, because people
 are shy to come up and say, you know, like, what do you do,
 or whatever. And so, I have
 found it, but, but more than in, as a, and as an evangelist
 coming across this, I, it’s
 been more my experience with, with teams that I’ve worked
 with, or teams that I’ve worked
 on. Right? And it’s more about the, the actual root
 problems that, often, they’re, they’re
 having in, in teams. And I’ve, I’ve learned to deal with
 people more openly, and be kind
 of like, you know, more open in that, a lot when I was
 dealing with customers.
 Okay.
 I mean, when I had to talk to customers, and, and that’s
 why I say, I mean, customer
 support is, is one of the best things that developers
 should do. I mean, I have had to
 deal with customers, you know, doing technical support in
 ISP, where, you know, the guy would
 call and say, I can’t send email, and he would say, are you
 connected to the internet? And
 I’m like, I don’t want to go to the internet, I want to
 send email, right? You have to learn
 to deal with that.
 Yeah.
 And it gives you patience, and it teaches you how to talk
 to people, because you can’t
 hang up the phone and say, you’re, you’re too stupid to
 send the email.
 Right.
 You can’t.
 Well, and, and the thing is, is, again, it goes to the
 empathy, remembering that once
 upon a time, you were in the same boat, you know, you may
 have been a child when it happened,
 but once upon a time, you did not know what the internet
 was. And, and, and trying to
 remember. One, you know, this, this reminds me of, you know
, I, I, you know, I’ve been,
 of a, a scenario I’d experienced in the military, where I
 was dealing with a bunch of new recruits
 and asking them where they, which, which jobs they were
 going to be taking. And, of course,
 you know, one was a medic, and one was going to go to
 language school, and one was going
 to be in, an MP, and the other one was, kind of, said, I’m
 just going to be a truck driver.
 And it kind of took me back. She was, she was really like,
 eh, you know, I’m not as
 good as these other people.
 And, you just, not, she also, like, kind of, from the other
 end, forgot that she was going
 to be providing a very valuable service, and that what she
 was doing was important, and
 that she was a human being, and, and had value. And, and
 when we’re looking at our, you know,
 ivory towers, we have these very fancy jobs, we’re senior
 engineers, and we’re, we have
 these very illustrious titles, and we forget that we couldn
‘t have that without the truck
 driver, who carries the computers.
 That we’re all part of this. If that customer didn’t call
 in and say, I want to send email,
 I don’t want to get on the internet. If it wasn’t for that
 person, then we wouldn’t even,
 we wouldn’t even be able to exist. You know, much like the
 truck driver, you couldn’t even
 have an infantry without having the trucker who could bring
 the stuff, the supplies.
 All the factory work, all that puts the chips together on
 the computer that you’re using
 every day. It’s every, every.
 And it’s, though we, it’s just, it’s part of an ecosystem,
 you know, that, that, you
 remember that, maybe you might, I don’t want to say humble,
 but just be more aware that
 Well, I definitely think there’s, you know, there is that,
 that missing in, in the developer
 community. I think we need, we all need to be a little bit
 more humble. We all need to
 come down, back down to earth and think about what we are
 doing as part of the global picture
 as opposed to our personal goals. And there was an article
 recently, in fact, on, I think
 it was on Forbes.
 Or somewhere about whether we are the, they were putting a
 comparison of, are we the Lindsay
 Lohan or are we the Meryl Streep of the, of Hollywood, you
 know, as opposed to are we in
 this startup business of getting venture capitalists and
 cashing out quick, or are we there to try
 and really change the world and grow up a business and grow
 it steadily? And I often
 find that we’re kind of more moving towards that big, you
 know, hotshot Hollywood kind
 of thing, right?
 Well, yeah, it’s, it’s the…
 The, the, the, the rock star, the ninja.
 Yeah, the ninja, the rock star.
 Yeah, yeah. It’s very fancy.
 It’s all, it’s all that.
 It’s all that.
 And it’s again, that’s, that desire to put ourselves up on,
 on, on a higher pedestal
 instead of realizing, okay, we’re, we’re part of an
 ecosystem that, you know, we, we can’t
 do these things without each other.
 And that’s one of the reasons that I wanted to support and,
 and make user group organizers
 and conference organizers, the people that bring people
 together, that’s one of the reasons
 is to help expose them, to support, to support the people
 that build the community and, and
 realize that we’re in this kind of together and it’s more
 fun to do it together than to
 do it alone.
 Everyone plays a role.
 Everyone is important.
 Yes.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to stay with
 me.
 Thank you.
 I really appreciate it.
 It was a pleasure.
 Pleasure having you.
 Thank you.
 Sorry.
 Oh.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.</p>

    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2015,\n and I'm sitting here with\n Vyacheslav Egorov, who gave a talk on benchmarking JS.\n Thank you\n very much for taking the time to speak with me. When you\n talk about\n benchmarking JS, are you talking about client-side JS? I\n mean, JS lives in a lot\n of different places. Is this Node? Is this browser JS? What\n are you benchmarking?\n So, I don't have any particular focus. I'm just looking at\n the pure JavaScript\n performance. So, it doesn't matter if you run your\n JavaScript on the client-side or\n server-side. Basically, no matter where you are, my talk\n applies to you. Okay. So,\n you know, even if I'm in V8 or Rhino or whatever, it's\n going to be... Okay, so,\n when you talk, what techniques and tools were you talking\n about? Where\n did this talk come from? What experiences did you have that\n led you to\n this? Well, I used to work on the V8 team, and when you\n work on a team of\n the VM engineers, you usually get different\n questions from the users, in this case, JavaScript\n developers, who don't\n completely understand what happens inside the VM and how\n they should\n measure performance of their code. And that's what this\n talk is based on.\n Basically, I monitor different social media, and I see\n people posting different\n benchmarks, and I look what happens there, and I explain\n why these benchmarks are\n usually incorrect. And that's, yeah, that's basically my\n experience. So, what is\n some of the things that you see that are incorrect, and\n like, what are some of the\n maybe some quick tips that maybe, or articles people should\n read or try to\n understand better about JavaScript performance? I think the\n biggest issue is\n that people still think that JavaScript implementations are\n very dumb, but these\n implementations are quite smart. So, I think that that's\n the main thing that\n they should know about that, and they should always account\n for the very\n advanced optimizations that the GIS engines are capable of\n doing now. So, there is no\n really single tip. They should just try to understand what\n's happening on the side. Okay.\n Now, I mean, do, if you're dealing with V8 optimization, I\n mean, because one of the\n things is JavaScript is one that's run anywhere, and it\n runs on V8 or Rhino or\n different browsers, or, you know, does the wisdom of this\n is good for\n JavaScript apply generally everywhere, or do you find\n people maybe benchmarking,\n and you say, oh, you did that benchmark on V8, try it on a\n different VM, and you'll see\n that it gets much different performance characteristics. Is\n that a pretty common situation?\n Sometimes that happens, but these days, the implementations\n really converge on, they\n apply the same techniques, so it's quite often that you see\n the same performance\n characteristics across all of the platforms you use. That's\n why this talk is\n quite universal, and this issue is quite universal. Okay,\n and when you're looking\n at the way JavaScript is being implemented, I mean, I've\n heard, I'm hearing on\n Twitter, there's a number of people that are tweeting about\n, you know, if you're doing, if\n you're trying to implement a class structure in JavaScript,\n you know, I'm just talking\n about writing JavaScript, you know, don't reimplement the\n classical inheritance structure\n inside of JavaScript versus, you know, using the polymorph\nic capabilities of JavaScript\n and the prototypal, that's actually the word I was trying\n to say, prototype, it's the end\n of the day, guys, sorry, the prototypal inheritance and\n using different ways of structuring\n your application, does that often not just play into the\n way people reason\n about writing JavaScript, but its performance, that, you\n know, if I'm implementing a\n class in JavaScript, you know, is that generally gonna\n perform worse or better\n than if I do something that's more of a native structure?\n So the thing is that\n JavaScript engines, they evolve naturally, so they follow\n the paths that people are\n using, so they optimize for the patterns that people are\n using. In this sense, if you use, for example,\n constructors and prototypes, this is actually the most\n performant way of writing JavaScript,\n especially if you keep everything, like, kind of static,\n and yeah, you just follow the common\n patterns and then you will be safe.\n Okay, okay, and as far as working on the V8 engine itself,\n that, I didn't realize it before\n our conversation, that, how did you get involved in working\n on actually the V8, which has become\n something of a industry change?\n Not just with a Chrome browser, but with Node being built\n on that. I mean, you're\n working on some pretty intense technology. How did you get\n involved in\n working on that team, and what were you doing with them?\n So, well, I stopped working on V8 three years ago, but I\n was doing the Java VM\n before back in Russia, and then V8 people were searching\n for, like, a person with a\n compiler background, and they hired me, so I joined the\n team, and I worked on different\n parts of the V8, so from garbage collection to compiler\n infrastructure, and yeah, so that's\n what I was doing. So, basically, I have the background in\n this, and that background seems\n to fit with what the team needed.\n Right, okay, and you know, you described earlier about two\n things, you know, one is that the\n JavaScript implementations are much smarter than people\n give them credit for, and that\n the current patterns are, are, of how people write their\n applications are being used in\n the JavaScript, and how they're being used to, to derive\n the future of, of, how these\n JVMs, excuse me, JVMs, I don't know, JSVMs work. I mean, is\n there something in the direction\n that you just see as a common pattern that people are using\n that you kind of wish they\n would just move away from, though? Like, even though we\n have classical inheritance structure,\n or what we call classical, you know, class and inheritance,\n but if they just maybe wrote\n their JavaScript this other way, it would be a lot more\n efficient.\n Right.\n And they might get a lot more native, and they might get a\n lot more benefits that they\n don't see now. Is there anything, any advice or\n observations you've made?\n No, I actually have an opposite issue. So, the, the\n JavaScript VMs, even though they\n are quite smart, they still, because they evolve by\n following what people do, they are\n very focused. So, what I really want them to do is to start\n expanding this area of fast\n JavaScript and support, like, different corners of the\n language they do not support well,\n or they just fall to the slow path, and so on.\n So, it's actually the other way around.\n Yeah.\n Not the people. So, the, the...\n Well, no, you're saying you wish they would do more of, be\n aware of these other types\n of structures.\n Yes, exactly.\n Yeah. Yeah. So, you, you are a little bit frustrated with\n it. Hey, we're just going\n to do this one type of structure, but JavaScript is so much\n more than that.\n Precisely.\n Okay, great. Well, thank you very much for taking the time\n to speak with me.\n Thank you for speaking with me.\n Yes, I appreciate it. All right, thank you.",

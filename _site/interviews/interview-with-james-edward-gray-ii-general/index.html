    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike again with UGtastic. I'm sitting down with\n James Edward Gray, who is known for Shades of Grey, the\n Ruby Rogues, and also if you've used his faster CSV library\n in 1.8, and now it's part of the standard lib in Ruby 1.9,\n not, well, just Ruby 1.9.\n But thanks for taking a moment to sit down, James. I\n appreciate it. Can you tell me a little bit about how you\n got involved with Ruby?\n Yeah, it was a long time ago. I think I entered the\n community in summer of 2004 or something like that, and I'd\n just kind of gotten off of a job and, you know, went into\n that cycle of learning new things, and I grabbed a copy of\n the programming Ruby and decided I'd teach myself a new\n language and kind of got stuck and never left.\n What were you doing before Ruby?\n I'm Java certified. I did that for several years. I spent a\n lot of time in the Perl community working there. The\n project I came off of just before getting into the Ruby\n community was a big Perl site using CGI and all kinds of\n crazy stuff.\n So you've kind of really embraced the Ruby community, and\n it seems to have been a lot of fun for you. What was it\n about Ruby?\n It was pretty early on, because 2004 was, I mean, it hadn't\n just come out, but that was pre-rails.\n Yeah, it was really early. It was easy to get hooked in the\n community back then. It was a very small, tight-knit group\n of people. We had basically one mailing list where most of\n our communication happened, and you would literally be\n posting questions and getting answers from people like Dave\n Thomas and stuff like that.\n Yeah, it was really early. It was easy to get hooked in the\n community back then. It was a very small, tight-knit group\n of people. We had basically one mailing list where most of\n our communication happened, and you would literally be\n posting questions and getting answers from people like Dave\n Thomas and stuff like that.\n So I was just on the tail end of that era, and got kind of\n sucked in that way.\n Okay. And then you created the Faster CSV library. What\n drove that?\n It was an accident, actually. They were talking on the Ruby\n core mailing list about how the CSV library was so slow,\n and people were trying to analyze why it was slow.\n Really, it was...\n It wasn't any particular fault of the library so much, just\n that it did a lot of work in a really tight loop, calling a\n bunch of methods and stuff, which in Ruby is pretty slow.\n And people were talking about ways to speed it up, and just\n a few weeks before that, I had read Mastering Regular Exp\nression or something like that.\n Right.\n And so I said, well, you can do it with one regular\n expression. And everybody's like, no, you can't. And so I\n went and pulled it out of the book and put it in the\n mailing list discussion, and a bunch of people threw really\n nasty examples at it that it didn't handle well. So I kept\n tweaking it and tweaking it to seeing if I could get it to\n do all of it, and I wrote this kind of tiny parser using\n primarily that one expression.\n And then a few other things to handle some gnarly edge\n cases, and that actually ended up being the faster CSV core\n for a long time. Eventually, somebody came along and rewr\note the parser not to use a regular expression, but that was\n the start of it.\n Yeah. And then, I mean, what was the process that went from\n being an external Ruby gem to being part of the standard\n lib? What did you have... Did you have to pay a fee? Did\n you have to sign a license agreement?\n Yeah, yeah, sign away all my... No, actually, there was\n discussion once faster CSV had been around for a while.\n There was discussion multiple times about, you know, should\n we replace the library and the standard core? And I think\n most people were positive to the idea in that, you know, we\n wanted a faster library and stuff.\n And, you know, we didn't want to break backwards\n compatibility. And I had a compatibility mode where it\n would behave like CSV, but it wasn't perfect. There were\n some cases where it couldn't do the right thing. So that\n was discussed for a long time, and nobody ever really came\n to a decision on that, which stalled it getting in.\n I was tired of it not being in there and wrote a pretty imp\nassioned plea to, you know, this is ridiculous. We have a\n much better choice. Can we just put it in? And they were\n decided... At that point, it was discussed one more time,\n and it was decided, all right, compatibility be damned. We\n'll just switch over.\n Yeah. Well, I remember upgrading from standard CSV to\n faster CSV and then migrating to 1.9 and had no problems. I\n mean, but then again, maybe our case wasn't that exotic.\n 1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it\n in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework\ned extensively because of encodings, which encoding, you\n know, your data is in matters how you find things like a\n quote and a comma, right?\n 1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it\n in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework\ned extensively because when I brought it in, 1.9 had the M17\nn engine, right?\n Yeah, we actually drove some bug fixes in Ruby at that time\n. When I was fixing CSV, I would figure out a lot of\n encoding stuff, and I would find some kind of bizarre edge\n cases and then post them to the list, and that actually\n ended up fixing certain bugs in Ruby.\n Oh, okay. So because you were actually driving a use case\n for a lot of these encoding issues.\n 1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it\n in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework\ned extensively because when I brought it in, 1.9 had the M17\nn engine, right?\n Yeah, so because you were actually driving a use case for a\n lot of these encoding issues.\n And that drove me crazy, so I wrote those articles that you\n mentioned on my blog.\n And so you're jumping over to some of the more social\n aspects, not just the code, but the Ruby Rogues. You're on\n there. You're a regular contributor to the Ruby Rogues\n podcast. How did you get involved with that?\n I'd had an idea from some other podcasts I listened to that\n had panel discussions, and I thought, man, it'd be really\n cool.\n Wouldn't it be cool to do that in Ruby someday? And I guess\n Chuck had had pretty much the same idea, and I can't\n remember who mentioned it first, but one of us mentioned it\n on Twitter.\n Wouldn't it be cool to have a panel of Ruby discussions,\n and whichever one didn't mention it, the other one was like\n, I've been thinking the same thing.\n And so we kind of started trading some emails over it and\n put together the original panel and just started doing it.\n And it was just something we did for fun in our spare time.\n But then it got popular pretty quick, really. And so we got\n lots of feedback, you know, your audio sucks, and things\n like that.\n Yeah, I hope eventually to get that kind of feedback.\n Right, yeah.\n Because I'll be like, yeah, they all suck.\n Yeah, when you get a bunch of listeners, they definitely\n bug you about it quick.\n Yeah.\n And, you know, we had some people leave and some people\n come in, and then we just kind of got lucky in getting a\n team that really gelled eventually, you know, and played\n well off of each other.\n And I think that's mostly what led to its success.\n Yeah, I listened to quite a few, and Ruby 5 and Ruby Rogues\n are two that I can tolerate listening to in the background.\n Because sometimes it's almost like listening a little bit\n to, like, I used to listen to talk radio.\n And the banter, it's not too heavy, but, you know, you can\n kind of tune it out, and it's like a conversation in the\n background.\n Right.\n But it's fun.\n And that kind of is going to provide my segue into the next\n topic is I joked with Avdi when I interviewed him about\n what kind of was the impetus for me to reach out to him was\n listening to the episode, and it was just this kind of ban\nter you guys were having.\n In the beginning of the show about stand-up chairs, stand-\nup desks.\n And I was like, I didn't know at the time that you, you\n know, you were in a wheelchair.\n And somebody said something about a stand-up desk, and you\n said something like, oh, I don't use one, and I don't know\n who it said.\n But they're like, well, why, James?\n And, you know, and then you guys all laughed.\n And, you know, and I said to Avdi that that's, you know,\n that's a very.\n Positive banter because you can't just have that one unless\n you guys were all friends and knew each other well.\n But it is germane to the technical community and being out\n and speaking and going to user groups and conferences and\n things like that.\n Has that been something that's, well, what has it been like\n?\n I hate that question, but what has it been like going to\n conferences?\n In a wheelchair?\n It's not, you know, it's not too bad.\n There was some time early when I was first in the Ruby\n community.\n You know, it was a very small group, so I was probably the\n first one in a wheelchair in the community.\n And there, just at that time, there wasn't awareness.\n And there, so they would just book conferences in certain\n locations without thinking about things.\n Like accessibility.\n And there were a couple of early instances where some of\n the conferences were not in good accessible locations.\n And that wasn't anybody's fault.\n Like I said, it was just a lack of awareness.\n And when it was brought up, you know, everybody felt\n terrible and all of that.\n But being in the community pretty early on, that made\n everybody kind of start putting it as a bullet point.\n On things you need to look for in a conference location,\n you know.\n And so that problem resolved itself really quickly,\n actually.\n And really, the harder part for me is just, it's not easy\n to travel with a big electric wheelchair.\n Especially if you're going to take a plane.\n It's very inconvenient.\n So when I fly, I switch to a manual wheelchair, which is\n much easier to get around with.\n When you're flying.\n But at the same time, it reduces my mobility a lot.\n So because of that, I just don't tend to go to a lot of far\naway conferences unless I make it a very special thing and\n do.\n So I tend to stick to the conferences around me.\n And I live basically right in the middle of the U.S.\n So I usually do the more central conferences.\n And so I don't get out to some of the big ones on the coast\n very often, though.\n So, you know, Josh Susser keeps threatening to drag me to\n Goguruko.\n And I would like to make it there someday.\n But every now and then, I'll make a special exception.\n I went to Japan for Ruby Taigi one time.\n But when going there, then I was traveling internationally.\n So you had things like, you know, how is the accessibility\n in Japan to consider.\n So I talked to Matt beforehand, and we had a discussion.\n And he told me it was really pretty good in Japan's modern\n cities.\n So to stay in the big, nice cities, but, you know, to avoid\n the little towns, which is pretty similar to here in the U.\nS., actually.\n So I stayed in big places like Kyoto and Tokyo and did that\n.\n And then just recently, this last year, I attended Aloha\n Ruby Conf.\n So I flew down to Hawaii and did that.\n And it was a great time.\n Yeah.\n So it is something that you communicate to organizers.\n Hey, if you're going to have me come speak, just heads up.\n Well, nowadays, I don't really have to do that anymore.\n You know, it seems to just, it's something we think about\n now.\n And I've seen other people in wheelchairs at conferences\n now.\n So, you know, we're a big, sprawling, worldly community\n that needs to be aware of everybody's needs.\n So, and luckily, the good thing is, you know, once you\n reach a certain point, we're a huge community.\n You know, Ruby Conf limits the attendance and still gets\n 800 to 1,000, you know.\n So when you have to put that many people in a place, you\n typically need a very modern hotel or convention center.\n And those kinds of places are always accessible.\n Yeah, they've already got that handled.\n Right.\n Yeah, because...\n It is interesting that as I'm doing these interviews, I'm\n learning more about people's experiences in a community\n that aren't necessarily young, white males.\n Right.\n But even young, white male, like yourself, you know, there\n's all different varieties of ability and accessibility.\n So it's kind of been interesting for me.\n I actually didn't come from the .NET.\n I mean, I can't...\n I came from a .NET community for 10 years and then started\n into Ruby.\n But in the last few years, it seems like it has grown.\n There's been some serious pains with isms in the community.\n But it seems like we're coming out on the other side of\n that with a much more enlightened community or the birth p\nangs of an enlightened community.\n And it's kind of interesting that it's not been something\n that's been enforced from the outside or a government\n mandate or some kind of regulation.\n It's been largely grassroots, the people in the community\n saying, hey, this is not acceptable or, hey, this has to be\n better.\n Yeah, I think that's really improving.\n I mean, like I said, I think now anybody who plans a Ruby\n conference is, you know, at least factors it into their\n thinking, you know, it should be accessible.\n You know, I have people tell me things like, we'd love to\n get you to come out to our conference sometimes.\n Oh, and I've checked.\n There's a ramp to get on stage, right?\n You know.\n Yeah.\n Things like that, you know.\n So I think it's in people's minds now and they factor it\n into their thinking.\n And just attending the conferences, I'm noticing how much\n more diverse they're getting.\n And, yeah, that makes me really proud of us as a community.\n So, you know, a lot of people in the Ruby community seem to\n be also, it has hit a certain stage where a lot of the, it\n seems like a lot of the earlier people who adopted it are\n now starting to look at other technologies.\n Is there anything for James?\n Are you looking at Clojure or anything like that?\n I play with lots of other things.\n You know, Erlang I've played with quite a bit.\n I haven't got around to Clojure or Scala yet, but they're\n on my list, you know, to get to eventually.\n Actually, in recent years, I've been more trying to focus\n on complementary things.\n Like, you know, a lot of people have been trying to focus\n on complementary things.\n A lot of people will go learn Clojure and, you know, use\n that a bunch.\n But I've been trying to do things like, I actually sat down\n at one point and finally sat down and learned Bash, you\n know, the shell.\n I just, you know, all those years I could use it a little,\n but never really sat down and read through a book on it and\n learned how to write loops in it or things like that.\n And, boy, that was phenomenal for my productivity.\n Like, I can't tell.\n I can't tell you how valuable it was, actually.\n I mean, I understand now when a process works, what's going\n on, you know, and what are the rules.\n And it's funny how much that helps.\n And so I've been learning more complementary things.\n I'm a big regular expression nut, and I enjoy digging down\n into the guts of Aniruma and building really complicated\n regular expressions to understand how the engine works and\n things.\n So I've been focusing more on complementary things.\n So I've been focusing more on complementary stuff and less\n on totally, you know, I'm going to switch to this other\n language kind of stuff.\n So you're going to come up with a Bash quiz book?\n No, I don't think my Bash is that good.\n You need to talk to somebody like Wayne Siegwin for that.\n He's really great at that kind of stuff.\n Yeah, and so just to kind of bring us to the tail end, you\n've written a few books.\n But the one that was kind of the most interesting for me\n was the Ruby quiz.\n I've not actually read it formally.\n I've sat down and looked through it.\n But it was interesting that it was more of like, here's\n some kind of neat things that maybe you wouldn't expect.\n And what was the impetus for creating that book?\n So when I came to the Ruby community, I came from the Perl\n community.\n And about the only thing I missed from Perl was Perl had\n Perl's quiz of the week back then running.\n And it was run by Mark Jason Dominus.\n And it was a little different from the Ruby quiz.\n It had like a beginner's level and then expert level each\n week and stuff.\n But I really missed doing that quiz and seeing all the\n solutions and stuff like that.\n So I created the Ruby quiz to fill that void because I\n missed it.\n And I ran it for quite a while.\n I can't remember how long.\n And Dave Thomas.\n At that time was, you know, really getting that pragmatic\n bookshelf going.\n And that was when they started producing a lot of Ruby\n books.\n And he came to me and said, would you like to take some of\n the best of the Ruby quizzes and turn them into a book?\n Okay.\n So that was how it happened.\n And he admitted at the time, he's all, you know, it\n probably won't be a great seller, you know, because it's\n kind of a niche thing and stuff.\n But he said that, you know, it's a neat topic and will be\n something fun to have.\n And the line ups.\n Yeah, it was always on the shelves at any of the consult\nancies I was at.\n But it's 1.8.\n Is there an update coming for 1.9?\n No, they recently took that book out of print.\n So I think it's all done.\n I did the Ruby quiz for three years and then kind of set it\n aside.\n It was a huge time commitment because, you know, you had to\n have problems ready to go.\n And I wrote the problem each week.\n And then also I had to, as problems came in, I had to dig\n through the code enough that I could figure it out and talk\n about it, you know.\n So that took me some time.\n And then I wrote up the summary each week.\n So all in all, it took me about eight hours a week, I would\n say, to just run it and sometimes more.\n It was a complicated problem or something.\n So eventually I was like, this is a lot of fun, but I'm\n going to have to set this aside if I'm going to be able to\n do other things.\n And there have been some people who've ran brief stints in\n the interim, but nothing like the original run.\n Okay.\n Well, thank you very much for taking the time to sit down\n and chat with me.\n So thank you very much.\n You have a good day.\n Absolutely.\n Thanks.",

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike again with UGtastic. I’m sitting down with
 James Edward Gray, who is known for Shades of Grey, the
 Ruby Rogues, and also if you’ve used his faster CSV library
 in 1.8, and now it’s part of the standard lib in Ruby 1.9,
 not, well, just Ruby 1.9.
 But thanks for taking a moment to sit down, James. I
 appreciate it. Can you tell me a little bit about how you
 got involved with Ruby?
 Yeah, it was a long time ago. I think I entered the
 community in summer of 2004 or something like that, and I’d
 just kind of gotten off of a job and, you know, went into
 that cycle of learning new things, and I grabbed a copy of
 the programming Ruby and decided I’d teach myself a new
 language and kind of got stuck and never left.
 What were you doing before Ruby?
 I’m Java certified. I did that for several years. I spent a
 lot of time in the Perl community working there. The
 project I came off of just before getting into the Ruby
 community was a big Perl site using CGI and all kinds of
 crazy stuff.
 So you’ve kind of really embraced the Ruby community, and
 it seems to have been a lot of fun for you. What was it
 about Ruby?
 It was pretty early on, because 2004 was, I mean, it hadn’t
 just come out, but that was pre-rails.
 Yeah, it was really early. It was easy to get hooked in the
 community back then. It was a very small, tight-knit group
 of people. We had basically one mailing list where most of
 our communication happened, and you would literally be
 posting questions and getting answers from people like Dave
 Thomas and stuff like that.
 Yeah, it was really early. It was easy to get hooked in the
 community back then. It was a very small, tight-knit group
 of people. We had basically one mailing list where most of
 our communication happened, and you would literally be
 posting questions and getting answers from people like Dave
 Thomas and stuff like that.
 So I was just on the tail end of that era, and got kind of
 sucked in that way.
 Okay. And then you created the Faster CSV library. What
 drove that?
 It was an accident, actually. They were talking on the Ruby
 core mailing list about how the CSV library was so slow,
 and people were trying to analyze why it was slow.
 Really, it was…
 It wasn’t any particular fault of the library so much, just
 that it did a lot of work in a really tight loop, calling a
 bunch of methods and stuff, which in Ruby is pretty slow.
 And people were talking about ways to speed it up, and just
 a few weeks before that, I had read Mastering Regular Exp
ression or something like that.
 Right.
 And so I said, well, you can do it with one regular
 expression. And everybody’s like, no, you can’t. And so I
 went and pulled it out of the book and put it in the
 mailing list discussion, and a bunch of people threw really
 nasty examples at it that it didn’t handle well. So I kept
 tweaking it and tweaking it to seeing if I could get it to
 do all of it, and I wrote this kind of tiny parser using
 primarily that one expression.
 And then a few other things to handle some gnarly edge
 cases, and that actually ended up being the faster CSV core
 for a long time. Eventually, somebody came along and rewr
ote the parser not to use a regular expression, but that was
 the start of it.
 Yeah. And then, I mean, what was the process that went from
 being an external Ruby gem to being part of the standard
 lib? What did you have… Did you have to pay a fee? Did
 you have to sign a license agreement?
 Yeah, yeah, sign away all my… No, actually, there was
 discussion once faster CSV had been around for a while.
 There was discussion multiple times about, you know, should
 we replace the library and the standard core? And I think
 most people were positive to the idea in that, you know, we
 wanted a faster library and stuff.
 And, you know, we didn’t want to break backwards
 compatibility. And I had a compatibility mode where it
 would behave like CSV, but it wasn’t perfect. There were
 some cases where it couldn’t do the right thing. So that
 was discussed for a long time, and nobody ever really came
 to a decision on that, which stalled it getting in.
 I was tired of it not being in there and wrote a pretty imp
assioned plea to, you know, this is ridiculous. We have a
 much better choice. Can we just put it in? And they were
 decided… At that point, it was discussed one more time,
 and it was decided, all right, compatibility be damned. We
‘ll just switch over.
 Yeah. Well, I remember upgrading from standard CSV to
 faster CSV and then migrating to 1.9 and had no problems. I
 mean, but then again, maybe our case wasn’t that exotic.
 1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it
 in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework
ed extensively because of encodings, which encoding, you
 know, your data is in matters how you find things like a
 quote and a comma, right?
 1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it
 in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework
ed extensively because when I brought it in, 1.9 had the M17
n engine, right?
 Yeah, we actually drove some bug fixes in Ruby at that time
. When I was fixing CSV, I would figure out a lot of
 encoding stuff, and I would find some kind of bizarre edge
 cases and then post them to the list, and that actually
 ended up fixing certain bugs in Ruby.
 Oh, okay. So because you were actually driving a use case
 for a lot of these encoding issues.
 1.9 was actually kind of a hurdle because when I brought it
 in, 1.9 had the M17n engine, right? So it had to be rework
ed extensively because when I brought it in, 1.9 had the M17
n engine, right?
 Yeah, so because you were actually driving a use case for a
 lot of these encoding issues.
 And that drove me crazy, so I wrote those articles that you
 mentioned on my blog.
 And so you’re jumping over to some of the more social
 aspects, not just the code, but the Ruby Rogues. You’re on
 there. You’re a regular contributor to the Ruby Rogues
 podcast. How did you get involved with that?
 I’d had an idea from some other podcasts I listened to that
 had panel discussions, and I thought, man, it’d be really
 cool.
 Wouldn’t it be cool to do that in Ruby someday? And I guess
 Chuck had had pretty much the same idea, and I can’t
 remember who mentioned it first, but one of us mentioned it
 on Twitter.
 Wouldn’t it be cool to have a panel of Ruby discussions,
 and whichever one didn’t mention it, the other one was like
, I’ve been thinking the same thing.
 And so we kind of started trading some emails over it and
 put together the original panel and just started doing it.
 And it was just something we did for fun in our spare time.
 But then it got popular pretty quick, really. And so we got
 lots of feedback, you know, your audio sucks, and things
 like that.
 Yeah, I hope eventually to get that kind of feedback.
 Right, yeah.
 Because I’ll be like, yeah, they all suck.
 Yeah, when you get a bunch of listeners, they definitely
 bug you about it quick.
 Yeah.
 And, you know, we had some people leave and some people
 come in, and then we just kind of got lucky in getting a
 team that really gelled eventually, you know, and played
 well off of each other.
 And I think that’s mostly what led to its success.
 Yeah, I listened to quite a few, and Ruby 5 and Ruby Rogues
 are two that I can tolerate listening to in the background.
 Because sometimes it’s almost like listening a little bit
 to, like, I used to listen to talk radio.
 And the banter, it’s not too heavy, but, you know, you can
 kind of tune it out, and it’s like a conversation in the
 background.
 Right.
 But it’s fun.
 And that kind of is going to provide my segue into the next
 topic is I joked with Avdi when I interviewed him about
 what kind of was the impetus for me to reach out to him was
 listening to the episode, and it was just this kind of ban
ter you guys were having.
 In the beginning of the show about stand-up chairs, stand-
up desks.
 And I was like, I didn’t know at the time that you, you
 know, you were in a wheelchair.
 And somebody said something about a stand-up desk, and you
 said something like, oh, I don’t use one, and I don’t know
 who it said.
 But they’re like, well, why, James?
 And, you know, and then you guys all laughed.
 And, you know, and I said to Avdi that that’s, you know,
 that’s a very.
 Positive banter because you can’t just have that one unless
 you guys were all friends and knew each other well.
 But it is germane to the technical community and being out
 and speaking and going to user groups and conferences and
 things like that.
 Has that been something that’s, well, what has it been like
?
 I hate that question, but what has it been like going to
 conferences?
 In a wheelchair?
 It’s not, you know, it’s not too bad.
 There was some time early when I was first in the Ruby
 community.
 You know, it was a very small group, so I was probably the
 first one in a wheelchair in the community.
 And there, just at that time, there wasn’t awareness.
 And there, so they would just book conferences in certain
 locations without thinking about things.
 Like accessibility.
 And there were a couple of early instances where some of
 the conferences were not in good accessible locations.
 And that wasn’t anybody’s fault.
 Like I said, it was just a lack of awareness.
 And when it was brought up, you know, everybody felt
 terrible and all of that.
 But being in the community pretty early on, that made
 everybody kind of start putting it as a bullet point.
 On things you need to look for in a conference location,
 you know.
 And so that problem resolved itself really quickly,
 actually.
 And really, the harder part for me is just, it’s not easy
 to travel with a big electric wheelchair.
 Especially if you’re going to take a plane.
 It’s very inconvenient.
 So when I fly, I switch to a manual wheelchair, which is
 much easier to get around with.
 When you’re flying.
 But at the same time, it reduces my mobility a lot.
 So because of that, I just don’t tend to go to a lot of far
away conferences unless I make it a very special thing and
 do.
 So I tend to stick to the conferences around me.
 And I live basically right in the middle of the U.S.
 So I usually do the more central conferences.
 And so I don’t get out to some of the big ones on the coast
 very often, though.
 So, you know, Josh Susser keeps threatening to drag me to
 Goguruko.
 And I would like to make it there someday.
 But every now and then, I’ll make a special exception.
 I went to Japan for Ruby Taigi one time.
 But when going there, then I was traveling internationally.
 So you had things like, you know, how is the accessibility
 in Japan to consider.
 So I talked to Matt beforehand, and we had a discussion.
 And he told me it was really pretty good in Japan’s modern
 cities.
 So to stay in the big, nice cities, but, you know, to avoid
 the little towns, which is pretty similar to here in the U.
S., actually.
 So I stayed in big places like Kyoto and Tokyo and did that
.
 And then just recently, this last year, I attended Aloha
 Ruby Conf.
 So I flew down to Hawaii and did that.
 And it was a great time.
 Yeah.
 So it is something that you communicate to organizers.
 Hey, if you’re going to have me come speak, just heads up.
 Well, nowadays, I don’t really have to do that anymore.
 You know, it seems to just, it’s something we think about
 now.
 And I’ve seen other people in wheelchairs at conferences
 now.
 So, you know, we’re a big, sprawling, worldly community
 that needs to be aware of everybody’s needs.
 So, and luckily, the good thing is, you know, once you
 reach a certain point, we’re a huge community.
 You know, Ruby Conf limits the attendance and still gets
 800 to 1,000, you know.
 So when you have to put that many people in a place, you
 typically need a very modern hotel or convention center.
 And those kinds of places are always accessible.
 Yeah, they’ve already got that handled.
 Right.
 Yeah, because…
 It is interesting that as I’m doing these interviews, I’m
 learning more about people’s experiences in a community
 that aren’t necessarily young, white males.
 Right.
 But even young, white male, like yourself, you know, there
‘s all different varieties of ability and accessibility.
 So it’s kind of been interesting for me.
 I actually didn’t come from the .NET.
 I mean, I can’t…
 I came from a .NET community for 10 years and then started
 into Ruby.
 But in the last few years, it seems like it has grown.
 There’s been some serious pains with isms in the community.
 But it seems like we’re coming out on the other side of
 that with a much more enlightened community or the birth p
angs of an enlightened community.
 And it’s kind of interesting that it’s not been something
 that’s been enforced from the outside or a government
 mandate or some kind of regulation.
 It’s been largely grassroots, the people in the community
 saying, hey, this is not acceptable or, hey, this has to be
 better.
 Yeah, I think that’s really improving.
 I mean, like I said, I think now anybody who plans a Ruby
 conference is, you know, at least factors it into their
 thinking, you know, it should be accessible.
 You know, I have people tell me things like, we’d love to
 get you to come out to our conference sometimes.
 Oh, and I’ve checked.
 There’s a ramp to get on stage, right?
 You know.
 Yeah.
 Things like that, you know.
 So I think it’s in people’s minds now and they factor it
 into their thinking.
 And just attending the conferences, I’m noticing how much
 more diverse they’re getting.
 And, yeah, that makes me really proud of us as a community.
 So, you know, a lot of people in the Ruby community seem to
 be also, it has hit a certain stage where a lot of the, it
 seems like a lot of the earlier people who adopted it are
 now starting to look at other technologies.
 Is there anything for James?
 Are you looking at Clojure or anything like that?
 I play with lots of other things.
 You know, Erlang I’ve played with quite a bit.
 I haven’t got around to Clojure or Scala yet, but they’re
 on my list, you know, to get to eventually.
 Actually, in recent years, I’ve been more trying to focus
 on complementary things.
 Like, you know, a lot of people have been trying to focus
 on complementary things.
 A lot of people will go learn Clojure and, you know, use
 that a bunch.
 But I’ve been trying to do things like, I actually sat down
 at one point and finally sat down and learned Bash, you
 know, the shell.
 I just, you know, all those years I could use it a little,
 but never really sat down and read through a book on it and
 learned how to write loops in it or things like that.
 And, boy, that was phenomenal for my productivity.
 Like, I can’t tell.
 I can’t tell you how valuable it was, actually.
 I mean, I understand now when a process works, what’s going
 on, you know, and what are the rules.
 And it’s funny how much that helps.
 And so I’ve been learning more complementary things.
 I’m a big regular expression nut, and I enjoy digging down
 into the guts of Aniruma and building really complicated
 regular expressions to understand how the engine works and
 things.
 So I’ve been focusing more on complementary things.
 So I’ve been focusing more on complementary stuff and less
 on totally, you know, I’m going to switch to this other
 language kind of stuff.
 So you’re going to come up with a Bash quiz book?
 No, I don’t think my Bash is that good.
 You need to talk to somebody like Wayne Siegwin for that.
 He’s really great at that kind of stuff.
 Yeah, and so just to kind of bring us to the tail end, you
‘ve written a few books.
 But the one that was kind of the most interesting for me
 was the Ruby quiz.
 I’ve not actually read it formally.
 I’ve sat down and looked through it.
 But it was interesting that it was more of like, here’s
 some kind of neat things that maybe you wouldn’t expect.
 And what was the impetus for creating that book?
 So when I came to the Ruby community, I came from the Perl
 community.
 And about the only thing I missed from Perl was Perl had
 Perl’s quiz of the week back then running.
 And it was run by Mark Jason Dominus.
 And it was a little different from the Ruby quiz.
 It had like a beginner’s level and then expert level each
 week and stuff.
 But I really missed doing that quiz and seeing all the
 solutions and stuff like that.
 So I created the Ruby quiz to fill that void because I
 missed it.
 And I ran it for quite a while.
 I can’t remember how long.
 And Dave Thomas.
 At that time was, you know, really getting that pragmatic
 bookshelf going.
 And that was when they started producing a lot of Ruby
 books.
 And he came to me and said, would you like to take some of
 the best of the Ruby quizzes and turn them into a book?
 Okay.
 So that was how it happened.
 And he admitted at the time, he’s all, you know, it
 probably won’t be a great seller, you know, because it’s
 kind of a niche thing and stuff.
 But he said that, you know, it’s a neat topic and will be
 something fun to have.
 And the line ups.
 Yeah, it was always on the shelves at any of the consult
ancies I was at.
 But it’s 1.8.
 Is there an update coming for 1.9?
 No, they recently took that book out of print.
 So I think it’s all done.
 I did the Ruby quiz for three years and then kind of set it
 aside.
 It was a huge time commitment because, you know, you had to
 have problems ready to go.
 And I wrote the problem each week.
 And then also I had to, as problems came in, I had to dig
 through the code enough that I could figure it out and talk
 about it, you know.
 So that took me some time.
 And then I wrote up the summary each week.
 So all in all, it took me about eight hours a week, I would
 say, to just run it and sometimes more.
 It was a complicated problem or something.
 So eventually I was like, this is a lot of fun, but I’m
 going to have to set this aside if I’m going to be able to
 do other things.
 And there have been some people who’ve ran brief stints in
 the interim, but nothing like the original run.
 Okay.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to sit down
 and chat with me.
 So thank you very much.
 You have a good day.
 Absolutely.
 Thanks.</p>

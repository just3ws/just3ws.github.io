    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at the end of GOTO Conf\n 2015.\n I'm sitting here with Corey Haynes, who gave a talk about\n fun with lambdas.\n Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.\n So, fun with lambdas, they sound...\n Lambdas are always one of those comp sci kind of sounding\n scary things.\n What is so fun about them?\n Well, it's along those lines of coding can be a joy\n when you put really crazy constraints on what you're doing.\n And so, the idea is what can you do if all you have is a\n lambda\n that takes one argument, can return one thing,\n start with nothing, and then slowly build up things.\n So, what we did was we went through what are called the\n piano axioms,\n which are statements about the natural numbers.\n They were developed by an Italian mathematician named Giuse\nppe Piano,\n and they just say things like, hey, zero is a number.\n And, hey, x equals x.\n And so, it's easy.\n It's very basic truth, stuff you learned in grade school\n about equality,\n that it's like, you know, transitive.\n X equals y, y equals z, x equals z.\n Right.\n And so, if you start with these, and then all you have is a\n lambda,\n can you actually build up enough to have a numbering system\n?\n And so, we start with, you know, zero, you know, and build\n a function called a zero.\n But then, to actually see if you're right, you have to\n build an assert function.\n Right.\n Well, to build an assert, you have to have an if statement.\n To have an if statement, you need true and false.\n And so, starting with nothing, you end up having to go back\n and build these fundamental structures\n and these fundamental sort of concepts in programming.\n And it's really just like, hey, what happens if you do it?\n Yeah.\n You know, there's a saying of like, don't try this at home.\n Yeah.\n This is more, don't try this at work, but do try it at home\n.\n Yeah.\n This is stuff that you should do at home, delete, have a\n good time, and, you know,\n one of the things I really like about this is that it's not\n just a thing.\n One of the things I really like to do is do exercises that\n take you away from, like,\n the work you do.\n And we all, you know, like to program, so why not program\n in the craziest possible way?\n Right.\n Yeah.\n And it just makes me think about the code retreat exercises\n you do.\n Did this talk, well, just to put some backstory in it, at\n the code retreats, you would do,\n well, I don't need to tell you, he would do different\n exercises.\n He would do different exercises where you would not do an\n if, or only use objects, or don't use a number.\n Yeah.\n Things like that.\n Did this talk kind of evolve from those thought exercises?\n The idea of programming with really heavy constraints\n always does.\n That's one of the things I like to do in workshops and\n things.\n The idea for this talk and the reason that I'm doing it\n actually came about from being in a sensory deprivation\n tank.\n Oh, really?\n Yeah.\n So I went, you know, here in Chicago, there's a place that\n you can,\n do it, so went and did this one time.\n And, of course, you get into this booth, or you're floating\n, and it's dark.\n Yeah.\n And, like, I remember getting in and going, well, what am I\n going to think about?\n Because I've got an hour in, like, pitch black and no sound\n.\n You've got to think about something.\n Yeah.\n So I was like, oh, hey, well, let me think about what are\n called church numerals.\n And I started doing that, and then just started to kind of\n think about lambdas and, like,\n a little bit of this lambda calculus stuff.\n And that came out of that, and I started actually working\n on a book about the lambda calculus\n and understanding lambdas and things like that, which is\n kind of on pause right now.\n But I started doing that.\n Incidentally, I did find out that they do not put eels into\n sensory deprivation tanks.\n Do you just hallucinate the eels then?\n No, no.\n I thought they might put them in there.\n I remember being in there, laying there, going, what if\n there were eels?\n Yeah.\n But there's not.\n Well, I've heard of people going into those and actually\n hallucinating.\n Mm-hmm.\n That, like, our minds are so used to the constant\n stimulation that it plays tricks on you.\n Yeah, that's what they say.\n I didn't.\n I mostly just thought about lambdas and eels.\n Well, I guess maybe you kind of already had a topic where\n somebody goes in and is like,\n okay, now what?\n Yeah, now what?\n Then you let it go.\n Yeah.\n I was also worried about regressing to being a Neon.\n I was worried about being a Neanderthal, like in Alfred\n States, but that also did not happen.\n I did not regress.\n You did not come out and hit somebody with a club.\n I did not.\n Oh.\n I was actually worried about that, because you never know.\n I saw it in a movie.\n But that's where this sort of this idea came from.\n And then I want to start doing a lot more talks.\n I've taken the last probably about a year, year and a half\n off of speaking at conferences,\n and I wanted to come back and do more, like, live coding\n and just, like, talks where I'm\n up there, it's me, it's Vim, just writing code and things\n like that.\n And this is a fun, it's a talk that you don't see a lot,\n and I'm not really one to give\n talks that are useful, I think, and especially my coding\n talks, it's like, there's, you know,\n the talks here at GOTO have been wonderful, you know, they\n've, one of the great things\n about this conference is they cover, like, Java, and they\n cover C#, they had a Futures\n of Java and Futures of C# talk.\n Yes.\n And they cover all of this great stuff, and I like to think\n, you know, it never hurts\n to have a talk that is completely useless.\n Yeah.\n And that's my, that's where I come into play.\n Well, I mean, it's not entirely, as you've described it,\n and the Code Retreat exercises\n kind of prove that they're not, it's not a useless exercise\n, sometimes it's, let's think\n about something that isn't just the \"stay it dry, how do I\n execute X\" things, and it's\n like, one of the things I always liked about Bob Martin's\n talks is how he starts off with\n those little diverse, little off-topic, totally irrelevant,\n but fun, and you never know what\n to expect.\n I mean, you know to expect that he's gonna talk about\n something about gravity, and he's\n gonna be really exuberant about it, but what is it gonna be\n, and what does it have to do\n with the topic, it may or may not have any relevance at all\n, but it's fun.\n It's so fun, yeah.\n I mean, you know, when you go to, when you're educated at\n all, there has to be fun, there\n has to be something to kind of hook you.\n Yeah.\n It's just lectures.\n Yeah, yeah, and why not, you know, sit there and watch\n somebody code up something that\n is not directly applicable, but is still like coding, and\n like, oh, hey, you know, a lot\n of people have heard about building up number systems like\n Lambda and all of that, but actually\n seeing it done and justified with these axioms is more of,\n it's a little bit of entertainment,\n but also that, you know, learning a little bit.\n It's very relevant, it's salient.\n It's on topic.\n It's just...\n Not day-to-day useful.\n Yeah, yeah.\n You shouldn't do it at work.\n Yeah, yeah.\n But always, you should do it at night.\n It's a good way to sort of get into the mood of programming\n, you know, doing something\n that you don't mind throwing away.\n I mean, I've done this and thrown it away many, many times\n while preparing for the talk,\n so yeah.\n So it made it a little bit fun to even prepare for.\n Oh, it was a blast to prepare for, I like, I really enjoy\n preparing for live coding talks,\n because it is like, you can't get up there and have an\n unexpected error happen, because\n standing up there, you know, it's horrible standing up\n there when you're trying to debug\n something.\n Yeah.\n And it's horrible sitting in the audience, because everyone\n in the audience sees where\n the bug is, except that you can't tell the speaker, because\n they can't hear you.\n And so live coding talks are always, like, you have to have\n them down.\n Yeah.\n So maybe when you're doing something that's a little bit\n more of a free-form performance,\n if you make a bug, eh, you know, it's jazz, you know, what\n do they say, there's no such\n thing as a wrong note, there's just the right note played\n in a different way.\n Yeah, there we go, there we go.\n Something along those lines.\n There we go.\n But if you're doing it like, oh, you have to do X, Y, and Z\n, yeah, there's definitely\n ...\n Yeah, and that's like, my talk, if, you know, you start\n with nothing, and 50 minutes later,\n we have a number system.\n Yeah.\n And if I, like, lose track somewhere, then we're not gonna\n have that at the end, and\n it's like, you can't, and then it's just like, why did, you\n know, what did we get out of\n this thing?\n Yeah.\n There's only, Ben Orenstein is a master at live coding\n talks.\n Yeah.\n He's really, really good at it.\n I don't know if he practices it, and, like, has all of his\n keystrokes memorized, I know\n I do.\n Yeah.\n Like, I practice it over and over again until I know the\n flow of the code.\n Oh, yeah.\n You were big in the katas and things like that, so ...\n Yeah, so ...\n Is it a similar kind of preparation that you go through?\n Yeah.\n And it feels a lot the same way, too, of just like that,\n writing the same code over and\n over again until you stop really thinking about the code,\n and you start thinking more\n about the flow of the code and the way that the concepts\n flow through it.\n One of the things about this is that we, in this talk, I\n talk about assert, and then that\n leads to if, and then that leads to true and false.\n And one of the things I tried to do was have it where I was\n sort of defining them above\n the previous thing.\n Okay.\n And then having it where when I implemented it, it made\n something lower, easier to implement,\n and clear, and then eventually, like, the test passed.\n Okay.\n So you've kind of like gone up and down and up and down.\n Yeah.\n And so I really worked on the flow, not just of the code,\n but of where it is in the flow.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Like, where it is in the file and how it does.\n So even, like, having a tempo and a rhythm.\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n Yeah.\n So.\n Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with\n me.\n Awesome.\n Thanks.\n Thanks a lot.\n Appreciate it.\n Bye-bye.\n So there we go.\n That's the end of the conference.\n Awesome.\n Yeah.\n So it ended up, it started a little slow today, but I ended\n up getting interviews with Jay\n Fields.\n Good.\n Trisha Gee.\n Gee.\n A whole bunch of people.\n I'm just drawing a blank on it.\n Yeah.\n I'm just drawing a blank on it.\n I have my notebook.\n Did you get Chris?\n Michael Thorn?\n No.\n No.\n But I got Josh.\n We got, what am I gonna do with my, oh, there it is.\n We got Jay Fields, Attila Szegedi.\n Szegedi, uh-huh.\n Szegedi.\n You know, he's Hungarian.\n Yep.\n Yeah.\n And 'cause I was, I wanted to pronounce his name correctly,\n and I said, \"Is it Bulgarian?\"\n He said, \"No, Hungarian.\"\n Okay.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Okay.\n Jay Fields.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Jay Fields.\n Jay Fields.\n We had some fun rescheduling stuff.\n Kyle.\n This guy.\n Gail.\n Gail Tanner.\n Oh, my God.\n We're gonna be having a second interview.\n Uh-huh.\n Uh-huh.\n Nice.\n Because we finished the interview, and then he and I walked\n downstairs, and we're talking,\n and he's talking about Java, and then he basically\n explained to me in a few minutes the entire\n Java lifecycle.\n Mm-hmm.\n Now, I don't mean, like, programming.\n Mm-hmm.\n I mean, the community process, and that, like, oh, yeah,\n Oracle says they're, you know,\n you're gonna be able to use it.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Mm-hmm.\n Oh, yeah.\n Yeah.\n drop support for a product they basically sign it over to\n there's all\n kinds of cool things about that so I was talking with him\n and I'm just kind of\n looking at him I remember some of the things you said but\n there was so much\n dense information that even he agreed that yeah we probably\n should talk about\n this on camera but I'm like I think this is another\n conversation yeah get another\n conversation so we're gonna do a Skype interview in the\n next few weeks that's\n awesome yeah that that's a really great thing to get into\n and I think that's really important because you know it's\n it's a really\n important thing to do and I think it's a really important\n thing to do and it's\n really important to do and I think it's a really important\n thing to do and it's\n really important to do and I think it's a really important\n thing to do and it's\n really important to do and I think it's a really important\n thing to do and

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at the end of GOTO Conf
 2015.
 I’m sitting here with Corey Haynes, who gave a talk about
 fun with lambdas.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
 So, fun with lambdas, they sound…
 Lambdas are always one of those comp sci kind of sounding
 scary things.
 What is so fun about them?
 Well, it’s along those lines of coding can be a joy
 when you put really crazy constraints on what you’re doing.
 And so, the idea is what can you do if all you have is a
 lambda
 that takes one argument, can return one thing,
 start with nothing, and then slowly build up things.
 So, what we did was we went through what are called the
 piano axioms,
 which are statements about the natural numbers.
 They were developed by an Italian mathematician named Giuse
ppe Piano,
 and they just say things like, hey, zero is a number.
 And, hey, x equals x.
 And so, it’s easy.
 It’s very basic truth, stuff you learned in grade school
 about equality,
 that it’s like, you know, transitive.
 X equals y, y equals z, x equals z.
 Right.
 And so, if you start with these, and then all you have is a
 lambda,
 can you actually build up enough to have a numbering system
?
 And so, we start with, you know, zero, you know, and build
 a function called a zero.
 But then, to actually see if you’re right, you have to
 build an assert function.
 Right.
 Well, to build an assert, you have to have an if statement.
 To have an if statement, you need true and false.
 And so, starting with nothing, you end up having to go back
 and build these fundamental structures
 and these fundamental sort of concepts in programming.
 And it’s really just like, hey, what happens if you do it?
 Yeah.
 You know, there’s a saying of like, don’t try this at home.
 Yeah.
 This is more, don’t try this at work, but do try it at home
.
 Yeah.
 This is stuff that you should do at home, delete, have a
 good time, and, you know,
 one of the things I really like about this is that it’s not
 just a thing.
 One of the things I really like to do is do exercises that
 take you away from, like,
 the work you do.
 And we all, you know, like to program, so why not program
 in the craziest possible way?
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And it just makes me think about the code retreat exercises
 you do.
 Did this talk, well, just to put some backstory in it, at
 the code retreats, you would do,
 well, I don’t need to tell you, he would do different
 exercises.
 He would do different exercises where you would not do an
 if, or only use objects, or don’t use a number.
 Yeah.
 Things like that.
 Did this talk kind of evolve from those thought exercises?
 The idea of programming with really heavy constraints
 always does.
 That’s one of the things I like to do in workshops and
 things.
 The idea for this talk and the reason that I’m doing it
 actually came about from being in a sensory deprivation
 tank.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah.
 So I went, you know, here in Chicago, there’s a place that
 you can,
 do it, so went and did this one time.
 And, of course, you get into this booth, or you’re floating
, and it’s dark.
 Yeah.
 And, like, I remember getting in and going, well, what am I
 going to think about?
 Because I’ve got an hour in, like, pitch black and no sound
.
 You’ve got to think about something.
 Yeah.
 So I was like, oh, hey, well, let me think about what are
 called church numerals.
 And I started doing that, and then just started to kind of
 think about lambdas and, like,
 a little bit of this lambda calculus stuff.
 And that came out of that, and I started actually working
 on a book about the lambda calculus
 and understanding lambdas and things like that, which is
 kind of on pause right now.
 But I started doing that.
 Incidentally, I did find out that they do not put eels into
 sensory deprivation tanks.
 Do you just hallucinate the eels then?
 No, no.
 I thought they might put them in there.
 I remember being in there, laying there, going, what if
 there were eels?
 Yeah.
 But there’s not.
 Well, I’ve heard of people going into those and actually
 hallucinating.
 Mm-hmm.
 That, like, our minds are so used to the constant
 stimulation that it plays tricks on you.
 Yeah, that’s what they say.
 I didn’t.
 I mostly just thought about lambdas and eels.
 Well, I guess maybe you kind of already had a topic where
 somebody goes in and is like,
 okay, now what?
 Yeah, now what?
 Then you let it go.
 Yeah.
 I was also worried about regressing to being a Neon.
 I was worried about being a Neanderthal, like in Alfred
 States, but that also did not happen.
 I did not regress.
 You did not come out and hit somebody with a club.
 I did not.
 Oh.
 I was actually worried about that, because you never know.
 I saw it in a movie.
 But that’s where this sort of this idea came from.
 And then I want to start doing a lot more talks.
 I’ve taken the last probably about a year, year and a half
 off of speaking at conferences,
 and I wanted to come back and do more, like, live coding
 and just, like, talks where I’m
 up there, it’s me, it’s Vim, just writing code and things
 like that.
 And this is a fun, it’s a talk that you don’t see a lot,
 and I’m not really one to give
 talks that are useful, I think, and especially my coding
 talks, it’s like, there’s, you know,
 the talks here at GOTO have been wonderful, you know, they
‘ve, one of the great things
 about this conference is they cover, like, Java, and they
 cover C#, they had a Futures
 of Java and Futures of C# talk.
 Yes.
 And they cover all of this great stuff, and I like to think
, you know, it never hurts
 to have a talk that is completely useless.
 Yeah.
 And that’s my, that’s where I come into play.
 Well, I mean, it’s not entirely, as you’ve described it,
 and the Code Retreat exercises
 kind of prove that they’re not, it’s not a useless exercise
, sometimes it’s, let’s think
 about something that isn’t just the “stay it dry, how do I
 execute X” things, and it’s
 like, one of the things I always liked about Bob Martin’s
 talks is how he starts off with
 those little diverse, little off-topic, totally irrelevant,
 but fun, and you never know what
 to expect.
 I mean, you know to expect that he’s gonna talk about
 something about gravity, and he’s
 gonna be really exuberant about it, but what is it gonna be
, and what does it have to do
 with the topic, it may or may not have any relevance at all
, but it’s fun.
 It’s so fun, yeah.
 I mean, you know, when you go to, when you’re educated at
 all, there has to be fun, there
 has to be something to kind of hook you.
 Yeah.
 It’s just lectures.
 Yeah, yeah, and why not, you know, sit there and watch
 somebody code up something that
 is not directly applicable, but is still like coding, and
 like, oh, hey, you know, a lot
 of people have heard about building up number systems like
 Lambda and all of that, but actually
 seeing it done and justified with these axioms is more of,
 it’s a little bit of entertainment,
 but also that, you know, learning a little bit.
 It’s very relevant, it’s salient.
 It’s on topic.
 It’s just…
 Not day-to-day useful.
 Yeah, yeah.
 You shouldn’t do it at work.
 Yeah, yeah.
 But always, you should do it at night.
 It’s a good way to sort of get into the mood of programming
, you know, doing something
 that you don’t mind throwing away.
 I mean, I’ve done this and thrown it away many, many times
 while preparing for the talk,
 so yeah.
 So it made it a little bit fun to even prepare for.
 Oh, it was a blast to prepare for, I like, I really enjoy
 preparing for live coding talks,
 because it is like, you can’t get up there and have an
 unexpected error happen, because
 standing up there, you know, it’s horrible standing up
 there when you’re trying to debug
 something.
 Yeah.
 And it’s horrible sitting in the audience, because everyone
 in the audience sees where
 the bug is, except that you can’t tell the speaker, because
 they can’t hear you.
 And so live coding talks are always, like, you have to have
 them down.
 Yeah.
 So maybe when you’re doing something that’s a little bit
 more of a free-form performance,
 if you make a bug, eh, you know, it’s jazz, you know, what
 do they say, there’s no such
 thing as a wrong note, there’s just the right note played
 in a different way.
 Yeah, there we go, there we go.
 Something along those lines.
 There we go.
 But if you’re doing it like, oh, you have to do X, Y, and Z
, yeah, there’s definitely
 …
 Yeah, and that’s like, my talk, if, you know, you start
 with nothing, and 50 minutes later,
 we have a number system.
 Yeah.
 And if I, like, lose track somewhere, then we’re not gonna
 have that at the end, and
 it’s like, you can’t, and then it’s just like, why did, you
 know, what did we get out of
 this thing?
 Yeah.
 There’s only, Ben Orenstein is a master at live coding
 talks.
 Yeah.
 He’s really, really good at it.
 I don’t know if he practices it, and, like, has all of his
 keystrokes memorized, I know
 I do.
 Yeah.
 Like, I practice it over and over again until I know the
 flow of the code.
 Oh, yeah.
 You were big in the katas and things like that, so …
 Yeah, so …
 Is it a similar kind of preparation that you go through?
 Yeah.
 And it feels a lot the same way, too, of just like that,
 writing the same code over and
 over again until you stop really thinking about the code,
 and you start thinking more
 about the flow of the code and the way that the concepts
 flow through it.
 One of the things about this is that we, in this talk, I
 talk about assert, and then that
 leads to if, and then that leads to true and false.
 And one of the things I tried to do was have it where I was
 sort of defining them above
 the previous thing.
 Okay.
 And then having it where when I implemented it, it made
 something lower, easier to implement,
 and clear, and then eventually, like, the test passed.
 Okay.
 So you’ve kind of like gone up and down and up and down.
 Yeah.
 And so I really worked on the flow, not just of the code,
 but of where it is in the flow.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like, where it is in the file and how it does.
 So even, like, having a tempo and a rhythm.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 So.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 Awesome.
 Thanks.
 Thanks a lot.
 Appreciate it.
 Bye-bye.
 So there we go.
 That’s the end of the conference.
 Awesome.
 Yeah.
 So it ended up, it started a little slow today, but I ended
 up getting interviews with Jay
 Fields.
 Good.
 Trisha Gee.
 Gee.
 A whole bunch of people.
 I’m just drawing a blank on it.
 Yeah.
 I’m just drawing a blank on it.
 I have my notebook.
 Did you get Chris?
 Michael Thorn?
 No.
 No.
 But I got Josh.
 We got, what am I gonna do with my, oh, there it is.
 We got Jay Fields, Attila Szegedi.
 Szegedi, uh-huh.
 Szegedi.
 You know, he’s Hungarian.
 Yep.
 Yeah.
 And ‘cause I was, I wanted to pronounce his name correctly,
 and I said, “Is it Bulgarian?”
 He said, “No, Hungarian.”
 Okay.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Okay.
 Jay Fields.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Jay Fields.
 Jay Fields.
 We had some fun rescheduling stuff.
 Kyle.
 This guy.
 Gail.
 Gail Tanner.
 Oh, my God.
 We’re gonna be having a second interview.
 Uh-huh.
 Uh-huh.
 Nice.
 Because we finished the interview, and then he and I walked
 downstairs, and we’re talking,
 and he’s talking about Java, and then he basically
 explained to me in a few minutes the entire
 Java lifecycle.
 Mm-hmm.
 Now, I don’t mean, like, programming.
 Mm-hmm.
 I mean, the community process, and that, like, oh, yeah,
 Oracle says they’re, you know,
 you’re gonna be able to use it.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.

 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 drop support for a product they basically sign it over to
 there’s all
 kinds of cool things about that so I was talking with him
 and I’m just kind of
 looking at him I remember some of the things you said but
 there was so much
 dense information that even he agreed that yeah we probably
 should talk about
 this on camera but I’m like I think this is another
 conversation yeah get another
 conversation so we’re gonna do a Skype interview in the
 next few weeks that’s
 awesome yeah that that’s a really great thing to get into
 and I think that’s really important because you know it’s
 it’s a really
 important thing to do and I think it’s a really important
 thing to do and it’s
 really important to do and I think it’s a really important

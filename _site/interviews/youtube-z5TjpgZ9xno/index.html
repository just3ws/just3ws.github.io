    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2014. I\n'm sitting here with Fred\n Gime, who is the president of the Chicago Java Users Group.\n Thank you very much for\n taking the time to speak with me. My pleasure. So, Chicago\n Java Users Group, and\n you're the president, you're the president of the Chicago\n Java Users Group. Yeah, that sounds so great right now.\n It is. It sounds like a very formal group. Do you have to\n wear robes? Oh yeah, yeah, we have a whole shebang and 41\n tons of wood, but not really.\n It sounds lovely. I'd have to visit. But no, so the group,\n I know it's been through a few iterations, but can you tell\n me about where it is now and how you got involved with it?\n So, so it is. So what happens is,\n is we sort of went through like a phase where, where, you\n know, there was a couple of transitions that happened.\n And, and I know the group was not as active as, as, you\n know, would like it to be in Chicago.\n So one of the things that happened was, you know, I started\n getting involved and I started pulling in.\n You know, we got, you know, Bob Pauling, Mike Manoa, then,\n you know, Danny Pan. They all come here and then we start\n working with the group.\n And one of the things we wanted to do is, is sort of this\n idea that...\n Oh, you're walking away.\n Yeah, sorry. Sort of this idea that Chicago is a great\n place to be a developer.\n Right.\n Right. So, so we looked around and, and, and it sort of\n like started like selfishly.\n So, you know, I work for, for a company in Chicago and then\n we're like, you know, looking for developers.\n And then sort of you realize there's nowhere to be found.\n You know, it's, it's like, you know, then we go to, we went\n to the universities and then we see like, oh, there's brain\n drain.\n It's like people are going to California, they're going to\n New York.\n They don't want to stay here in Chicago.\n And we're like, why is that?\n And, and part of it is, it was like, you know, there's, we\n do have like the Midwestern values of people just work and\n stuff.\n But, but we're missing that sort of like that, that\n programmer culture in here.\n And we're like, we have such big companies, you know, you\n know, like Google is opening an office here.\n You know, we definitely have, you know, like Groupon is\n here, you know, Orbitz is here, you know, CME is here.\n We have such many developers and we're trying to figure out\n how can we make this a better place for being a developer?\n Right.\n So, so, you know, the first thing is, you know, start, you\n know, start doing a podcast, you know, javapubhouse.com.\n Okay.\n And then it's, you know, sort of trying to educate people\n about how to program in Java.\n Then we go to JavaOne.\n And that was javapubhouse.\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n Yeah.\n And .com.\n So, so if you check that out.\n Oh, please do.\n Yeah.\n So, so, so then, then we go to JavaOne and say, go back to\n your group, get involved.\n So, you know, come back here, you know, we see that the\n group was in transition because\n the prior president, you know, he was just moving away and\n just, you know, job revocation.\n And we sort of were stagnant a little bit.\n I mean, our meetings were sort of like, you know, you\n showed up, there was, you know,\n the presenter, there were like seven people showed up, you\n know, two of them were recruiters.\n One of them was, as part of the C job, you know, took over\n as a group representative.\n And then you get three people that show up because they\n always like to show up.\n Right.\n So, so then, then we're like, look at it.\n This is, this is pretty bad because we have so many Chicago\n Java developers.\n So, so we took it like a year and a half ago and we said,\n we're going to push this through.\n We're going to start getting the word out and we're going\n to start having a schedule.\n We're going to start bringing good speakers.\n And, and, and it took a lot of effort.\n You know, we, we opened up a meetup, we organized the meet\nups and, and, you know, we grew up\n from essentially, you know, five, 10 people.\n Now in our meetup group, we have, we just crushed 900.\n Wow.\n And you, you brought it back to, I mean, it was a life\n support.\n Yeah.\n I wouldn't say me.\n It's, it's.\n But you, it was like, we're all you.\n Three guys are president in the groves.\n Yeah.\n No, no, it was no, but, but the reality is we got a lot of,\n you know, I mean, I was lucky\n enough to run into, into Buckle and Michael, you know,\n Jenny and, and they all like, like\n give back the spirit, you know what I mean?\n As you know, you have to sort of be crazy to do this use of\n groups.\n Right.\n So there's, there's really no benefit, you know, to it.\n Like, you know, I mean, there, there might be some, but\n really there's some financial\n benefit is more time.\n And a lot of them is a lot of pain, but you know, when you\n get that, that guy that says,\n you know, thanks for everything.\n That was super cool.\n Then it's like, all right, that made my day for the next\n month.\n Right.\n And, and, and we really push it because we, I do believe,\n and I always say this is like\n a preacher.\n Every time I go and talk to our group, it's like Chicago\n has no reason to envy New York\n or California.\n You know, we have such a great programmers here because,\n you know, need to sort of like\n do them out.\n Because what happens is, is we have so many, so much\n Midwestern values that we just, we're,\n we're, we're going to go home, you know, but, but there's\n no reason for people to move anywhere\n else.\n You know, we can create a culture here and that's where we\n've been trying to go to see\n job.\n Well, the interesting parts that we're doing is, you know,\n we first started with, with\n one practice, you know, we, one meeting a month, you know,\n and then, then we sort of\n expanded that.\n Now we have two meetings a month where one of them is\n essentially, you know, now we have\n an advanced track for people that are like, you know,\n bleeding edge technology type of\n deal.\n You know, and that's where you get to see Elasticsearch.\n That's where you get to see the new features of Spring.\n You know, we, we sort of have like a, like a sort of like a\n, we'll call it sort of like\n an introductory track, where it's, you know, intro to multi\n-training, intro to, you know,\n you know, how to, how to do unit testing, you know, and,\n and the idea is, you know,\n that if we have support and we have the bandwidth.\n We can start adding it.\n So we have enough people already, you know, in our group\n that there's, there's definitely\n different interests that we can target.\n Well, yeah, right now, Java is kind of gone.\n It's still in the throes of that revolution of languages.\n And the JVM has always been multi, multi-lingual.\n Yeah.\n But now we're looking at Scala.\n You know, we had a keynote here.\n Groovy.\n Yeah.\n We had Martin Odersky give a keynote here.\n Oh yeah, that's right.\n So Scala is huge, Clojure, huge.\n And JRuby, of course, is still also, you know.\n Yeah.\n There's some amazing work.\n And then the Android platform.\n Are you looking at some cross-pollination of ideas using\n like outreach with Ruby?\n Definitely.\n And that's the other thing that we're sort of trying to\n sort of seed in.\n You know, I mean, we're, we're not just doing Java anymore.\n We're sort of trying to be more JVM driven.\n Right.\n And, and, and one of the things that we're sort of\n experimenting.\n We're sort of adding one or two.\n We're taking one or two of our sessions in there and doing\n more of like a JVM, right.\n So, you know, if you're Groovy, you know, or if you are\n doing Clojure.\n And, and, and we're trying to see how those fit in if there\n's interest.\n Because sometimes what happens is you as a Java developer\n don't know.\n Oh gosh, I could have used Scala here.\n I could have used JRuby here, you know.\n Right.\n And, and what we're trying to do is sort of like say, hey,\n it's not just about Java.\n You know, there's, you have choices.\n Right.\n And, and, you know, just you can be aware of them and how\n you can use them in your daily work.\n Yeah.\n Java becomes a language on the Java.\n Yeah.\n On the JVM, right.\n But I mean, yeah.\n In all seriousness, some of these languages are, are so\n polished that they stand on their own.\n Yeah.\n You know, right beside Java as, as a first class citizen on\n, on, on the JVM.\n So, you know, it, it, it sounds like there's like the world\n is your, is your home.\n The world is your, is your oyster for, for Java developers\n right now.\n If you know how to, if you already understand the\n fundamentals of the JVM and JARS and that\n infrastructure, you can do a lot.\n No, and that's, and that's the fun part is, is, is, it's,\n if you're a Java developer,\n it's a great time to be one.\n Because, you know, you can, you can just sit down, look at\n it, and play with all the other\n stuff that is coming out.\n You know, even other languages like, you know, like JRuby,\n which is JAR's daughter, you know,\n he's, he's crazy.\n But, but, you know, it's like, the work he does is great.\n You know, I mean, there's, the, the work that is being done\n on the JVM itself, which is,\n sometimes people don't understand, like, the JVM, the\n machinery that runs this, has like\n 20 years of the most brilliant minds just reporting on it.\n Right.\n You know, you've got Charlie Han, you've got, you've even\n got Gil Tenet, you know, you've\n got , which is the Eclipse founder.\n You know, they all have their own ideas.\n They always talk.\n They always figure out how to do things better so that, you\n know, if you're a JVM user,\n you don't have to.\n Right.\n And, and, and, you know, and that's one of the other things\n, like, you know, what I wanted\n to say about our group is, is we're trying to educate\n people about all these things.\n Right.\n So one of them is, is, look, there's tons of choices for\n the JVM and you shouldn't just\n look at Java as the only tool that you can have.\n But the other thing we're doing is, is we're training them\n or, or we're trying to spread\n the word about what a JSR is, what the JCP, you know, our\n group is actually a member,\n you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a participant, not a\n voting member, but a participant on\n the JCP process.\n Right.\n So, so what that means is, is we're starting to have\n influence, you know, and, and the\n end goal of the Chicago Java User's Group will be to one\n day, you know, look at the\n biggest ones is London and Brazil.\n Right.\n And, you know, and say, look guys, you know, we are\n representative.\n We are, you know, we actually make an influence on the\n language.\n Right.\n We, you know, we, with our group, we help shape the way\n Java looks in the future.\n So you're even looking at beyond simply having a community\n come together and have a place\n to share it as a community.\n But also to help build a, a groundswell to be able to help\n become part of the future\n of the platform.\n Which is fun because the things that we're doing is, is for\n example, we have sort of\n like this bi-weekly newsletter, right?\n And in this newsletter, we, we have like a professional's\n corner, which is sort of breaking\n down like things like, this is the JSRs, this is the JCP,\n this is how you contribute.\n This is how, you know, these are the ones that seem\n interesting for us to contribute\n on.\n And we're, we're sort of carrying that with what Bob Palman\n is doing, which is getting\n the doers out, right?\n Right.\n There's a lot of people that, you know, they love to like\n sit down and, and sort of like\n passively receive the information.\n And it's great.\n But we also want to sort of like tailor out to who like the\n makers are.\n So, so like Bob is creating this, what is called the maker\n track, which is not so much\n as being on a lecture, but it's almost, you can think about\n like hackathons, hack days,\n people that, you know, like want to sit down and type.\n Right.\n And so one of the great things we're trying to do is we're\n trying to say, hey, we know\n you're out there, let's get you in, you know, let's get you\n get the language even better.\n You know, let's, let's make Chicago relevant, not just in\n terms of us being Java consumers,\n but in terms of shaping the history of Java.\n Right.\n And, and even with the open source landscape, I know that\n there are people that I've worked\n with here in Chicago that are creating their own platforms\n and tools on top of Java.\n One person I interviewed was Igor Polovoy.\n He's created a whole suite of tools and now he's building a\n, a consultancy on top of those\n tools.\n But, you know, people are doing stuff here in Chicago.\n Yes.\n You don't have to go to wherever, you know, you know,\n wherever the guys that are creating\n Groovy or wherever they're doing, I don't know if that's\n Chicago or somewhere else,\n but there's people here in Chicago that are creating.\n Yeah.\n And working with Java and doing interesting things with the\n platform.\n And that's what we want to hear about.\n I mean, we want to, we want to get them out and get them\n and give them a stage for them\n to say, Hey, this is happening here and just take notes.\n Right.\n Right.\n Yeah.\n That this is a rich community.\n It isn't just a bunch of people who report in, punch in,\n punch out.\n No.\n And that's, and that's what we're trying to, you know, I\n mean that, that's the reason why,\n why, you know, CJUK is there now.\n It's like, we're trying to spread the word and we try to\n make the community here, you\n know, not just big, but influential.\n So if I go on meetup.com, I'll be able to find, if I search\n Chicago Java.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n We should be the first thing, you know, like the Chicago\n Java Research Group, CJUK.\n Our website is cjug.org.\n C-J-U-G.org.\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n Great.\n And then, yeah, we're on Meetup.\n So, you know, sign up.\n Come on.\n We want to get, our goal is to get to 1500 people in Meetup\n by the end of the year.\n So.\n Oh, okay.\n Great.\n All right.\n Well then go sign up.\n Thank you very much for taking the time to speak.\n Mike, thank you so much.\n Appreciate it.\n Appreciate it.\n Bye.\n Bye.\n Bye.\n Bye.\n Bye.\n Thank you so much.\n Appreciate it.\n That's fine.\n User groups with lots to say.\n Interviews and more.\n No way.\n Sharing great ideas in the tech community.\n Fascinating conversations.\n A plethora of information.\n Find out for yourself today at ugtastic.com.\n Thank you.",

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2014. I
‘m sitting here with Fred
 Gime, who is the president of the Chicago Java Users Group.
 Thank you very much for
 taking the time to speak with me. My pleasure. So, Chicago
 Java Users Group, and
 you’re the president, you’re the president of the Chicago
 Java Users Group. Yeah, that sounds so great right now.
 It is. It sounds like a very formal group. Do you have to
 wear robes? Oh yeah, yeah, we have a whole shebang and 41
 tons of wood, but not really.
 It sounds lovely. I’d have to visit. But no, so the group,
 I know it’s been through a few iterations, but can you tell
 me about where it is now and how you got involved with it?
 So, so it is. So what happens is,
 is we sort of went through like a phase where, where, you
 know, there was a couple of transitions that happened.
 And, and I know the group was not as active as, as, you
 know, would like it to be in Chicago.
 So one of the things that happened was, you know, I started
 getting involved and I started pulling in.
 You know, we got, you know, Bob Pauling, Mike Manoa, then,
 you know, Danny Pan. They all come here and then we start
 working with the group.
 And one of the things we wanted to do is, is sort of this
 idea that…
 Oh, you’re walking away.
 Yeah, sorry. Sort of this idea that Chicago is a great
 place to be a developer.
 Right.
 Right. So, so we looked around and, and, and it sort of
 like started like selfishly.
 So, you know, I work for, for a company in Chicago and then
 we’re like, you know, looking for developers.
 And then sort of you realize there’s nowhere to be found.
 You know, it’s, it’s like, you know, then we go to, we went
 to the universities and then we see like, oh, there’s brain
 drain.
 It’s like people are going to California, they’re going to
 New York.
 They don’t want to stay here in Chicago.
 And we’re like, why is that?
 And, and part of it is, it was like, you know, there’s, we
 do have like the Midwestern values of people just work and
 stuff.
 But, but we’re missing that sort of like that, that
 programmer culture in here.
 And we’re like, we have such big companies, you know, you
 know, like Google is opening an office here.
 You know, we definitely have, you know, like Groupon is
 here, you know, Orbitz is here, you know, CME is here.
 We have such many developers and we’re trying to figure out
 how can we make this a better place for being a developer?
 Right.
 So, so, you know, the first thing is, you know, start, you
 know, start doing a podcast, you know, javapubhouse.com.
 Okay.
 And then it’s, you know, sort of trying to educate people
 about how to program in Java.
 Then we go to JavaOne.
 And that was javapubhouse.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 And .com.
 So, so if you check that out.
 Oh, please do.
 Yeah.
 So, so, so then, then we go to JavaOne and say, go back to
 your group, get involved.
 So, you know, come back here, you know, we see that the
 group was in transition because
 the prior president, you know, he was just moving away and
 just, you know, job revocation.
 And we sort of were stagnant a little bit.
 I mean, our meetings were sort of like, you know, you
 showed up, there was, you know,
 the presenter, there were like seven people showed up, you
 know, two of them were recruiters.
 One of them was, as part of the C job, you know, took over
 as a group representative.
 And then you get three people that show up because they
 always like to show up.
 Right.
 So, so then, then we’re like, look at it.
 This is, this is pretty bad because we have so many Chicago
 Java developers.
 So, so we took it like a year and a half ago and we said,
 we’re going to push this through.
 We’re going to start getting the word out and we’re going
 to start having a schedule.
 We’re going to start bringing good speakers.
 And, and, and it took a lot of effort.
 You know, we, we opened up a meetup, we organized the meet
ups and, and, you know, we grew up
 from essentially, you know, five, 10 people.
 Now in our meetup group, we have, we just crushed 900.
 Wow.
 And you, you brought it back to, I mean, it was a life
 support.
 Yeah.
 I wouldn’t say me.
 It’s, it’s.
 But you, it was like, we’re all you.
 Three guys are president in the groves.
 Yeah.
 No, no, it was no, but, but the reality is we got a lot of,
 you know, I mean, I was lucky
 enough to run into, into Buckle and Michael, you know,
 Jenny and, and they all like, like
 give back the spirit, you know what I mean?
 As you know, you have to sort of be crazy to do this use of
 groups.
 Right.
 So there’s, there’s really no benefit, you know, to it.
 Like, you know, I mean, there, there might be some, but
 really there’s some financial
 benefit is more time.
 And a lot of them is a lot of pain, but you know, when you
 get that, that guy that says,
 you know, thanks for everything.
 That was super cool.
 Then it’s like, all right, that made my day for the next
 month.
 Right.
 And, and, and we really push it because we, I do believe,
 and I always say this is like
 a preacher.
 Every time I go and talk to our group, it’s like Chicago
 has no reason to envy New York
 or California.
 You know, we have such a great programmers here because,
 you know, need to sort of like
 do them out.
 Because what happens is, is we have so many, so much
 Midwestern values that we just, we’re,
 we’re, we’re going to go home, you know, but, but there’s
 no reason for people to move anywhere
 else.
 You know, we can create a culture here and that’s where we
‘ve been trying to go to see
 job.
 Well, the interesting parts that we’re doing is, you know,
 we first started with, with
 one practice, you know, we, one meeting a month, you know,
 and then, then we sort of
 expanded that.
 Now we have two meetings a month where one of them is
 essentially, you know, now we have
 an advanced track for people that are like, you know,
 bleeding edge technology type of
 deal.
 You know, and that’s where you get to see Elasticsearch.
 That’s where you get to see the new features of Spring.
 You know, we, we sort of have like a, like a sort of like a
, we’ll call it sort of like
 an introductory track, where it’s, you know, intro to multi
-training, intro to, you know,
 you know, how to, how to do unit testing, you know, and,
 and the idea is, you know,
 that if we have support and we have the bandwidth.
 We can start adding it.
 So we have enough people already, you know, in our group
 that there’s, there’s definitely
 different interests that we can target.
 Well, yeah, right now, Java is kind of gone.
 It’s still in the throes of that revolution of languages.
 And the JVM has always been multi, multi-lingual.
 Yeah.
 But now we’re looking at Scala.
 You know, we had a keynote here.
 Groovy.
 Yeah.
 We had Martin Odersky give a keynote here.
 Oh yeah, that’s right.
 So Scala is huge, Clojure, huge.
 And JRuby, of course, is still also, you know.
 Yeah.
 There’s some amazing work.
 And then the Android platform.
 Are you looking at some cross-pollination of ideas using
 like outreach with Ruby?
 Definitely.
 And that’s the other thing that we’re sort of trying to
 sort of seed in.
 You know, I mean, we’re, we’re not just doing Java anymore.
 We’re sort of trying to be more JVM driven.
 Right.
 And, and, and one of the things that we’re sort of
 experimenting.
 We’re sort of adding one or two.
 We’re taking one or two of our sessions in there and doing
 more of like a JVM, right.
 So, you know, if you’re Groovy, you know, or if you are
 doing Clojure.
 And, and, and we’re trying to see how those fit in if there
‘s interest.
 Because sometimes what happens is you as a Java developer
 don’t know.
 Oh gosh, I could have used Scala here.
 I could have used JRuby here, you know.
 Right.
 And, and what we’re trying to do is sort of like say, hey,
 it’s not just about Java.
 You know, there’s, you have choices.
 Right.
 And, and, you know, just you can be aware of them and how
 you can use them in your daily work.
 Yeah.
 Java becomes a language on the Java.
 Yeah.
 On the JVM, right.
 But I mean, yeah.
 In all seriousness, some of these languages are, are so
 polished that they stand on their own.
 Yeah.
 You know, right beside Java as, as a first class citizen on
, on, on the JVM.
 So, you know, it, it, it sounds like there’s like the world
 is your, is your home.
 The world is your, is your oyster for, for Java developers
 right now.
 If you know how to, if you already understand the
 fundamentals of the JVM and JARS and that
 infrastructure, you can do a lot.
 No, and that’s, and that’s the fun part is, is, is, it’s,
 if you’re a Java developer,
 it’s a great time to be one.
 Because, you know, you can, you can just sit down, look at
 it, and play with all the other
 stuff that is coming out.
 You know, even other languages like, you know, like JRuby,
 which is JAR’s daughter, you know,
 he’s, he’s crazy.
 But, but, you know, it’s like, the work he does is great.
 You know, I mean, there’s, the, the work that is being done
 on the JVM itself, which is,
 sometimes people don’t understand, like, the JVM, the
 machinery that runs this, has like
 20 years of the most brilliant minds just reporting on it.
 Right.
 You know, you’ve got Charlie Han, you’ve got, you’ve even
 got Gil Tenet, you know, you’ve
 got , which is the Eclipse founder.
 You know, they all have their own ideas.
 They always talk.
 They always figure out how to do things better so that, you
 know, if you’re a JVM user,
 you don’t have to.
 Right.
 And, and, and, you know, and that’s one of the other things
, like, you know, what I wanted
 to say about our group is, is we’re trying to educate
 people about all these things.
 Right.
 So one of them is, is, look, there’s tons of choices for
 the JVM and you shouldn’t just
 look at Java as the only tool that you can have.
 But the other thing we’re doing is, is we’re training them
 or, or we’re trying to spread
 the word about what a JSR is, what the JCP, you know, our
 group is actually a member,
 you know, it’s, it’s, it’s, it’s a participant, not a
 voting member, but a participant on
 the JCP process.
 Right.
 So, so what that means is, is we’re starting to have
 influence, you know, and, and the
 end goal of the Chicago Java User’s Group will be to one
 day, you know, look at the
 biggest ones is London and Brazil.
 Right.
 And, you know, and say, look guys, you know, we are
 representative.
 We are, you know, we actually make an influence on the
 language.
 Right.
 We, you know, we, with our group, we help shape the way
 Java looks in the future.
 So you’re even looking at beyond simply having a community
 come together and have a place
 to share it as a community.
 But also to help build a, a groundswell to be able to help
 become part of the future
 of the platform.
 Which is fun because the things that we’re doing is, is for
 example, we have sort of
 like this bi-weekly newsletter, right?
 And in this newsletter, we, we have like a professional’s
 corner, which is sort of breaking
 down like things like, this is the JSRs, this is the JCP,
 this is how you contribute.
 This is how, you know, these are the ones that seem
 interesting for us to contribute
 on.
 And we’re, we’re sort of carrying that with what Bob Palman
 is doing, which is getting
 the doers out, right?
 Right.
 There’s a lot of people that, you know, they love to like
 sit down and, and sort of like
 passively receive the information.
 And it’s great.
 But we also want to sort of like tailor out to who like the
 makers are.
 So, so like Bob is creating this, what is called the maker
 track, which is not so much
 as being on a lecture, but it’s almost, you can think about
 like hackathons, hack days,
 people that, you know, like want to sit down and type.
 Right.
 And so one of the great things we’re trying to do is we’re
 trying to say, hey, we know
 you’re out there, let’s get you in, you know, let’s get you
 get the language even better.
 You know, let’s, let’s make Chicago relevant, not just in
 terms of us being Java consumers,
 but in terms of shaping the history of Java.
 Right.
 And, and even with the open source landscape, I know that
 there are people that I’ve worked
 with here in Chicago that are creating their own platforms
 and tools on top of Java.
 One person I interviewed was Igor Polovoy.
 He’s created a whole suite of tools and now he’s building a
, a consultancy on top of those
 tools.
 But, you know, people are doing stuff here in Chicago.
 Yes.
 You don’t have to go to wherever, you know, you know,
 wherever the guys that are creating
 Groovy or wherever they’re doing, I don’t know if that’s
 Chicago or somewhere else,
 but there’s people here in Chicago that are creating.
 Yeah.
 And working with Java and doing interesting things with the
 platform.
 And that’s what we want to hear about.
 I mean, we want to, we want to get them out and get them
 and give them a stage for them
 to say, Hey, this is happening here and just take notes.
 Right.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 That this is a rich community.
 It isn’t just a bunch of people who report in, punch in,
 punch out.
 No.
 And that’s, and that’s what we’re trying to, you know, I
 mean that, that’s the reason why,
 why, you know, CJUK is there now.
 It’s like, we’re trying to spread the word and we try to
 make the community here, you
 know, not just big, but influential.
 So if I go on meetup.com, I’ll be able to find, if I search
 Chicago Java.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We should be the first thing, you know, like the Chicago
 Java Research Group, CJUK.
 Our website is cjug.org.
 C-J-U-G.org.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Great.
 And then, yeah, we’re on Meetup.
 So, you know, sign up.
 Come on.
 We want to get, our goal is to get to 1500 people in Meetup
 by the end of the year.
 So.
 Oh, okay.
 Great.
 All right.
 Well then go sign up.

    "transcript": "It's Mike with Uteastic. I'm here at RailsConf 2014 and I'm\n standing here with\n Richard Schneeman who gave a talk earlier today called Her\noku 2014: A Year in Review.\n He's also a Rails core contributor and he's created a few\n libraries over the\n years. One popular one was Sextant for helping Rails\n developers see their\n routes without having to run reg routes and another was W\nicked which was a\n multi-stop form wizard basically. Thank you very much for\n taking the time to\n speak with me. Yeah, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.\n So Heroku 2014: A Year in Review.\n We're only a few months into 2014. How do you how do you do\n that? That's that's\n pretty... So Rails is really important to us so I measure\n my personal\n years from RailsConf to RailsConf. Oh, okay. So it's a\n RailsConf standard year.\n Yeah. Okay, so it's like the RailsConf calendar. Yeah,\n there's like the Gregorian.\n Exactly, exactly. So yeah, a lot of really interesting\n things have happened this\n past year. We've been majorly focused on performance and a\n lot of a lot of things\n in that vein. Would you like to hear something about that?\n Yeah, no. Please tell me about your talk.\n Yeah, okay, great. So one of the biggest things that we\n released is PX Dynos.\n Okay. In the past, a dyno represents 512 megabytes of RAM\n and with a PX\n dyno instead you get, I want to say it's 8 gigabytes of RAM\n and six physical\n cores. Per dyno? Six physical CPUs, yes, per dyno. Okay. So\n that in the past you've\n always been able to scale up very horizontally very easily\n but if you're\n either using an application that has a lot of memory use or\n if you want a\n lot of concurrency per application, let's say you want to\n run a bunch of Unicorn\n workers or Puma workers per actual physical dyno, then you\n weren't able to in\n the past. But now we're focused a lot more on not just fast\n but consistently\n fast is kind of the key with that. So do you work with the\n dyno team or what\n is your role at Heroku?\n Okay, so I work with the Ruby task force. So Terrence Lee\n and I are on the\n languages team and we are in charge of the Ruby experience.\n That means we\n maintain the build pack whenever you do get push Heroku\n master and it's like all\n bundle install and everything flies by your screen. That's\n us. Okay. So if\n like deploying is slow. I definitely use your work. Okay,\n great, great. Many times, many,\n many times. We also luckily the company thinks it's a big\n part of that product\n is actually coming out and interfacing with the community\n and like finding real\n world people, you know, experiencing their pains or\n experiencing like, you\n know, oh, I love, you know, love your work and just\n figuring out what people like,\n what people don't like, how they're working and where we\n need to go in the\n future. So a lot of that as well. Okay. So I, we, yeah, we\n haven't, my, my team\n hasn't directly implemented the PX dynos product. But what\n's, what's, what's\n interesting to us is that once they came out with this,\n this product and they\n said, okay, we think this is important. We think this is\n valuable. They, they\n kind of came to each individual language team and said like\n, all right, well, how,\n you know, how should people on, uh, you know, Python\n optimize and maximize this?\n And they're like, all right, now that we have this, how do\n people on Ruby like\n really take advantage of it? Exactly. Exactly. And so, um,\n working in like\n hand in hand with some customers and, uh, doing a lot of\n experiments, um, had\n just one afternoon I was like, oh, you know, I wonder how\n many rescue workers I\n could run on, on a PX dino. And I was like, I was like, I\n'll just guess and\n start at 200. Oh, okay. I can run that many. Yeah. Let's\n just see how much\n until we can make it fall over. Yeah, exactly. Uh, and just\n playing around, uh,\n and ended up, so I wrote some documentation.\n For a rescue pool as a result of that. Um, and, uh, so it,\n it's really nice\n having access to, you know, customers who are kind of\n craving and demanding for\n these things and that are interested in actually working\n hand in hand with you\n in, in, in implementing them and getting real world\n feedback from them. So it's\n not just, it's, uh, it's also been able to take a lot of\n that and take it over\n to, um, other, uh, open source frameworks like, like rails.\n Right. Um, so yeah,\n so as far as the, the, uh, I'm actually gonna have to talk\n to you after this interview\n about, about the PX machine because my client does utilize\n that. So that's a, that's very\n interesting. Uh, but that's not too much for the interview.\n Uh, but as far as how did you\n come to be with Heroku X? I mean, you're, you're with Rails\n core kind of, can you tell\n us a little bit about your journey there? Did you, were you\n with Rails core before Heroku\n or? Uh, so, um, actually on the, uh, on the issues team, uh\n, currently. And, uh, I'm a\n big fan of Rails core. Uh, so I started working for Heroku\n about two years ago, a little over\n two years ago. Previous to that, I was working for a\n company called Gowalla. Uh, they were\n competitors to four square, got bought by, uh, got bought\n by Facebook and Facebook doesn't\n employ a lot of Ruby programmers. A little different\n platform. Yeah. Uh, and, um, like\n loved Heroku basically forever and they happen to have,\n have a, have a job slot. And for,\n uh, for getting involved with Rails, that was something\n that like,\n it was my dream to like have a commit into Rails. I\n remember like bumping into, uh, Aaron\n at that conference at one point in time and being like, how\n do I do this? And like, how\n does it even work? I was like, I want to add this, this, uh\n, it's like, you used to have\n get and patch and post in your log, say like saying this\n request is a get request. And\n for some reason that got like bumped or like no longer in\n there. Uh, or maybe it was an\n error message or something. And I was like, how do I do\n this? And like, he helped me out\n and I was like, this is great. And so I kept on trying to\n do that just whenever, you know,\n whenever, whenever I ran into like stubbed my toe on\n something, I'd be like, Oh, I'd\n like to actually like dig in and fix that. And just after\n time, um, yeah, like, uh, actually\n with, with sextant, the, um, the routes in the browser, I\n released that. And then, um,\n some of the, some people on rails core actually\n independently approached me and they were\n like, we love this. Can we, can you like, please work with\n us to like get it into rails,\n you know, rails proper. Uh, and like that, that was a\n pretty good experience and just\n hung out in, uh, in campfire.\n Yeah.\n I just did a bunch of work. And one day I got an email\n saying, Hey, like we've given\n you like, like collaborator access, like, you know, feel\n free to like close out, uh,\n close out issues and like, you know, do, do all of this\n stuff.\n Right. Right. Yeah. That's interesting. You're in the path\n that it's, it's a common path.\n It's get in there, do something, be helpful, reach out,\n communicate. And if you're doing\n good stuff, eventually you're probably going to become a\n trusted member of the team. And,\n uh,\n you just keep going at, uh, uh, Charles Nutter had kind of\n the same kind of story. He was\n just saw some issues and just wanted to help out. And\n eventually, you know, he's running\n J Ruby.\n Next thing you know. Yeah. I mean like very, like the, the\n famous quote, like writers,\n right. It's like open source contributors contribute. Yeah.\n Like just, you know, start\n out with documentation and like, it's a, it's not magic. It\n's a lot of work. Yeah. And,\n uh, so I'm just curious, working with, with the, uh, the\n Ruby, uh, team. I mean, you know,\n you probably have to do a lot of interaction with people\n outside the community. Um, you\n know, how's that, how do you balance that with your, your\n action, like going to conferences\n and talking, how do you balance that with, with working\n inside of your own organization?\n Oh, uh, it's really tough. Um, any kind of balance is\n really tough. I, I tend to be the\n kind of person that like, I get a problem and I like focus,\n like that's all I can think\n about that one problem. Right. Uh, so a lot of force is\n really important. I, I, I, I, I,\n uh, so a lot of forced context switching, um, a lot of, uh,\n uh, I mean, even, even at,\n um, even at conferences, just like having to, having to\n partition time and saying like,\n okay, you know what? Even like I'm here, I'm still, I'm\n still meeting people. Um, one trick,\n well, maybe it's not a trick, but at conferences, I think,\n uh, I think it's actually a mistake\n to try to go to every single session. Right. And you know,\n even if it's, especially if\n it's a multi-track session or, you know, conference, uh,\n you just can't. Uh, so I try to reserve\n percent of my time for just hallway interactions, bumping\n into people, uh, like having some\n great conversations, finding out what other people are, are\n working on. And I still love\n going to, going to the talks and hearing everything there.\n Um, but, uh, you know, so instead of\n working in my room, like I'll work outside and if somebody\n bumps into me and asked me\n a question about something I've been working on or they\n want to like, Oh, I've, you know,\n I've typically the best feedback is like unsolicited\n feedback. Like somebody is like, Hey, you\n know, I didn't like this one thing that happened.\n When I was pushing to Roku and I'm like, Oh, you know, I\n can actually do something\n about that. Like, uh, just, you know, recently we've had\n some, it's like people are like,\n Oh, I'm getting bad performance. And it's like, Oh, well\n like, let me take a look. And\n it's like, okay, Oh, you're, I see you're using web brick\n in, in production. And it's\n like, and it's like, Oh, well I didn't know that. And it's\n like, it just says rails, like\n it says rail server and it's, you know, it's just rail\n server. And it's like, yeah, but\n so it's a little bit more complicated. Yeah. And it's like,\n we, well, we, you know, and\n some warnings and some things that just, uh, this kind of\n like gradual trying to gently\n lead you to the path of happiness and Zen, you know, and\n this is a, probably a question\n on a left field, but I'm, since I mentioned Charles Nutter\n earlier, um, Hedius is a J\n Ruby, uh, maintainer. Um, the, there's, there's a trend\n towards, uh, moving towards, uh, using\n J Ruby or encouraging people to use J Ruby because of, uh,\n proper threading and, and,\n um, you know, uh, some of that support when you're long\n running processes. Is that something\n that, um, like you, are you using C Ruby or are you\n starting to encourage people to look\n at J Ruby with Heroku or is that, uh, so, so we've\n supported J Ruby for quite a while\n actually. And, um, we, we work with Charles quite a bit. We\n also, we have, uh, we have\n Rubinius. It's, it's actually technically not supported,\n but, uh, but it's still, it's\n still runs and it, and it works. Our support is actually\n provided through the Rubinius.\n Team. Um, yeah. And, uh, so I just generally wreck\n encourage people to like play and have\n fun and like, please, like if you're on MRI now, try MRR,\n try J Ruby. And like I've written\n when we first, when we first launched J Ruby, like I wrote\n docs on like migrating a rails\n app and, um, you know, just some, some things, uh, like\n even being a beat, trying that as\n a gem author, I was like, Oh wow, there's all of these gems\n that like just don't work\n on J Ruby.\n Because of like C extensions. And, um, and so like in the\n future, now that I'm working\n on gems, I'm very conscious of like how, like on Travis, I\n always test on J Ruby and always\n test on Rubinius.\n I was going to say like with Travis, you can have multiple\n targets. Exactly. You can, you\n can just say, test this on J Ruby or MRI one nine one eight\n two things like that. So you\n can get some of that flexibility.\n Yeah. And, and it's also the, the, the more people who try\n it, the more people who demand\n these.\n Things that are looking for them, the more knowledge there\n is out there. It's a lot easier\n today to switch over your app to use J Ruby. Um, I mean the\n community portion of it, typically\n my code has been relatively trivial. Most of my code just\n works and it's, and like over\n time, like it gets faster. Uh, and so like, I think every\n app is slightly different. Uh,\n so some people just want like running, you know, fast\n scripts and like, that's exactly\n like, you cannot beat the MRI, like boot up time.\n It is great and amazing. Like if you want to, if you can\n parallelize and you could,\n you're actually doing real Ruby, like number crunching,\n like J Ruby and threads. Like I\n still, but I still actually recommend MRI, even though we\n have a global interpreter lock,\n it's still not, it's not like a, you can still write\n threaded code, especially if you're\n using like a web server, um, or you're on the web, like you\n're using database calls,\n you're hitting APIs, all these other things. Didn't you\n create a background worker gem\n called threaded?\n Threaded or something like that.\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Cause actually I, I spiked on\n that myself between sucker\n punch and, and, uh, threaded. Uh, so yeah. And being able\n to use that for background\n on, on J Ruby and save a few bucks on dynos was, yeah. Yeah\n. So I had forgotten about\n that. So even, even in other smaller aspects of my NAB as,\n as popular, you've done a bunch\n of open source. Sorry, that was, that was, you're talking\n about threads and I'm sitting\n there. Oh yeah. That's.\n That's something that's, you know, you can do that. You don\n't necessarily always have\n to spin up a rescue worker in a separate dyno or in, in, in\n Heroku. And, and, and that's\n the reason I was asking about moving to J Ruby is, um, you\n know, being able to do those\n things where I can consolidate and have one, like if I don\n't have a long running process,\n it's going to be kind of quick, but I want to be able to\n just return my response back\n to the clients. I can, uh, you know, run this thing in a\n separate, uh, thread. And, uh,\n earlier today you had a book signing. So you're, you're,\n you're moving into the world of being\n an author. You, you're a code writer and now you're a code\n book author.\n Yeah. A writer of many things. So the name of the book is\n Heroku up and running. It's\n a published on O'Reilly. Also a coauthor, uh, Neil Midd\nleton. He like, uh, it was, he\n actually started the book and then, and then brought me in.\n Um, so a lot of there, there's\n some other Heroku books out there and most of them just end\n up being do this, then do\n this, then do that.\n And it's just number one, all the majority of it is very\n technical, very rote. It's all\n online already and there's no explanation as to why. And we\n wanted something that was\n a little bit more timeless. Um, it's really got into the\n philosophy and, uh, it was published\n a couple, a couple of months ago and it's, it's not\n outdated yet.\n Oh, really? Yeah.\n Yeah.\n That's rare.\n It's, it's like, and that, it's like, that's the, that's\n like the golden standard of what\n we were going for.\n It didn't make it past the three month mark.\n Um, yeah, I, I think like just, yeah, we're right there. So\n we'll know in a few days whether\n or not totally like revamp these hierarchies if the book\n collapses. But, uh, and, and I've\n had, I've had some people tell me, uh, that like they\n played around a little bit with\n Heroku and there's a, there's a large number of things that\n they're like, they didn't realize\n or they knew that that was what happened, but not\n necessarily why it happened that way.\n Yeah. And even today at lunch, I was hearing one of the, uh\n, other, uh, employees from\n Heroku that's here was sitting at the table and people were\n just picking his brain and\n trying to understand. And it sounds like Heroku has done a\n great job of black boxing a lot\n and, and making a very low barrier to entry, but being able\n to go beyond that and say,\n okay, what can I really do with this, this thing that I\n have with this dino? What is,\n what is that? You know, and it's, and these obstructions\n sometimes, you know, they're,\n they're good for marketing and being able to just have a\n common language. But when somebody's\n really like, how do I get in there and do stuff and things\n I do every day, there's a,\n you can run,\n a Heroku run bash and I can actually get a bash shell into\n like an LS and CD and, you\n know, and I did not know that. Exactly. And it's like, I\n literally use this every single\n day. And I mean, so there's, there's some stuff in there\n like that, that like, it's\n like, there's a whole section on debugging and troubles\nhooting and like, you know, things\n that you might not have known before. But I mean, like we,\n we do love the, we, we aim\n to be as easy to use as possible. Um, and kind of my goal\n in life is to make that a little\n less black boxy, uh, and, and just make it a little bit\n more user friendly. Yeah. So\n like for the 90% use cases, it's a nice even path and it's\n nice and well trodden. But when\n you need to go off and just LS into your bin directory and\n see what permissions are on\n some bin. Yeah. And which, you know, which bundle and all\n of these other, like, so, so\n there's a lot of that stuff that's being exposed in the\n book and how to do that. Yeah. Because\n to, to be frank, people, when I said, well, uh, Heroku Dyno\n is a Linux instance. I'm going\n to boot to 10. I think it's where it's at right now or\n something. They were like, I\n did not know. Wait, it runs on a computer. I thought it was\n literally magic. I mean,\n it's almost like, is it, is it some kind of custom bespoke,\n you know, image that's its\n own kernel build or something like that. Yeah. You don't\n know, you know, it's, it's hard to tell those kinds\n of things unless you go in there and dig around. I had\n somebody come up to me. Oh, you, you inject\n a custom version of rails, right? No. Yeah. It's the\n version of rails you specify. I think\n something that comes from when I would rewrite your, your\n HTML and you're like, well, what\n really happened there? No, I just wrote a file and it went\n and also mounting some gems\n that used to do. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's changed. But\n anyway, again, thank you very\n much for taking the time. Heroku up and running. Heroku up\n and running. Right. And that's, I'm sure it's on Amazon\n and all those places. Wherever you find books.

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>It’s Mike with Uteastic. I’m here at RailsConf 2014 and I’m
 standing here with
 Richard Schneeman who gave a talk earlier today called Her
oku 2014: A Year in Review.
 He’s also a Rails core contributor and he’s created a few
 libraries over the
 years. One popular one was Sextant for helping Rails
 developers see their
 routes without having to run reg routes and another was W
icked which was a
 multi-stop form wizard basically. Thank you very much for
 taking the time to
 speak with me. Yeah, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.
 So Heroku 2014: A Year in Review.
 We’re only a few months into 2014. How do you how do you do
 that? That’s that’s
 pretty… So Rails is really important to us so I measure
 my personal
 years from RailsConf to RailsConf. Oh, okay. So it’s a
 RailsConf standard year.
 Yeah. Okay, so it’s like the RailsConf calendar. Yeah,
 there’s like the Gregorian.
 Exactly, exactly. So yeah, a lot of really interesting
 things have happened this
 past year. We’ve been majorly focused on performance and a
 lot of a lot of things
 in that vein. Would you like to hear something about that?
 Yeah, no. Please tell me about your talk.
 Yeah, okay, great. So one of the biggest things that we
 released is PX Dynos.
 Okay. In the past, a dyno represents 512 megabytes of RAM
 and with a PX
 dyno instead you get, I want to say it’s 8 gigabytes of RAM
 and six physical
 cores. Per dyno? Six physical CPUs, yes, per dyno. Okay. So
 that in the past you’ve
 always been able to scale up very horizontally very easily
 but if you’re
 either using an application that has a lot of memory use or
 if you want a
 lot of concurrency per application, let’s say you want to
 run a bunch of Unicorn
 workers or Puma workers per actual physical dyno, then you
 weren’t able to in
 the past. But now we’re focused a lot more on not just fast
 but consistently
 fast is kind of the key with that. So do you work with the
 dyno team or what
 is your role at Heroku?
 Okay, so I work with the Ruby task force. So Terrence Lee
 and I are on the
 languages team and we are in charge of the Ruby experience.
 That means we
 maintain the build pack whenever you do get push Heroku
 master and it’s like all
 bundle install and everything flies by your screen. That’s
 us. Okay. So if
 like deploying is slow. I definitely use your work. Okay,
 great, great. Many times, many,
 many times. We also luckily the company thinks it’s a big
 part of that product
 is actually coming out and interfacing with the community
 and like finding real
 world people, you know, experiencing their pains or
 experiencing like, you
 know, oh, I love, you know, love your work and just
 figuring out what people like,
 what people don’t like, how they’re working and where we
 need to go in the
 future. So a lot of that as well. Okay. So I, we, yeah, we
 haven’t, my, my team
 hasn’t directly implemented the PX dynos product. But what
‘s, what’s, what’s
 interesting to us is that once they came out with this,
 this product and they
 said, okay, we think this is important. We think this is
 valuable. They, they
 kind of came to each individual language team and said like
, all right, well, how,
 you know, how should people on, uh, you know, Python
 optimize and maximize this?
 And they’re like, all right, now that we have this, how do
 people on Ruby like
 really take advantage of it? Exactly. Exactly. And so, um,
 working in like
 hand in hand with some customers and, uh, doing a lot of
 experiments, um, had
 just one afternoon I was like, oh, you know, I wonder how
 many rescue workers I
 could run on, on a PX dino. And I was like, I was like, I
‘ll just guess and
 start at 200. Oh, okay. I can run that many. Yeah. Let’s
 just see how much
 until we can make it fall over. Yeah, exactly. Uh, and just
 playing around, uh,
 and ended up, so I wrote some documentation.
 For a rescue pool as a result of that. Um, and, uh, so it,
 it’s really nice
 having access to, you know, customers who are kind of
 craving and demanding for
 these things and that are interested in actually working
 hand in hand with you
 in, in, in implementing them and getting real world
 feedback from them. So it’s
 not just, it’s, uh, it’s also been able to take a lot of
 that and take it over
 to, um, other, uh, open source frameworks like, like rails.
 Right. Um, so yeah,
 so as far as the, the, uh, I’m actually gonna have to talk
 to you after this interview
 about, about the PX machine because my client does utilize
 that. So that’s a, that’s very
 interesting. Uh, but that’s not too much for the interview.
 Uh, but as far as how did you
 come to be with Heroku X? I mean, you’re, you’re with Rails
 core kind of, can you tell
 us a little bit about your journey there? Did you, were you
 with Rails core before Heroku
 or? Uh, so, um, actually on the, uh, on the issues team, uh
, currently. And, uh, I’m a
 big fan of Rails core. Uh, so I started working for Heroku
 about two years ago, a little over
 two years ago. Previous to that, I was working for a
 company called Gowalla. Uh, they were
 competitors to four square, got bought by, uh, got bought
 by Facebook and Facebook doesn’t
 employ a lot of Ruby programmers. A little different
 platform. Yeah. Uh, and, um, like
 loved Heroku basically forever and they happen to have,
 have a, have a job slot. And for,
 uh, for getting involved with Rails, that was something
 that like,
 it was my dream to like have a commit into Rails. I
 remember like bumping into, uh, Aaron
 at that conference at one point in time and being like, how
 do I do this? And like, how
 does it even work? I was like, I want to add this, this, uh
, it’s like, you used to have
 get and patch and post in your log, say like saying this
 request is a get request. And
 for some reason that got like bumped or like no longer in
 there. Uh, or maybe it was an
 error message or something. And I was like, how do I do
 this? And like, he helped me out
 and I was like, this is great. And so I kept on trying to
 do that just whenever, you know,
 whenever, whenever I ran into like stubbed my toe on
 something, I’d be like, Oh, I’d
 like to actually like dig in and fix that. And just after
 time, um, yeah, like, uh, actually
 with, with sextant, the, um, the routes in the browser, I
 released that. And then, um,
 some of the, some people on rails core actually
 independently approached me and they were
 like, we love this. Can we, can you like, please work with
 us to like get it into rails,
 you know, rails proper. Uh, and like that, that was a
 pretty good experience and just
 hung out in, uh, in campfire.
 Yeah.
 I just did a bunch of work. And one day I got an email
 saying, Hey, like we’ve given
 you like, like collaborator access, like, you know, feel
 free to like close out, uh,
 close out issues and like, you know, do, do all of this
 stuff.
 Right. Right. Yeah. That’s interesting. You’re in the path
 that it’s, it’s a common path.
 It’s get in there, do something, be helpful, reach out,
 communicate. And if you’re doing
 good stuff, eventually you’re probably going to become a
 trusted member of the team. And,
 uh,
 you just keep going at, uh, uh, Charles Nutter had kind of
 the same kind of story. He was
 just saw some issues and just wanted to help out. And
 eventually, you know, he’s running
 J Ruby.
 Next thing you know. Yeah. I mean like very, like the, the
 famous quote, like writers,
 right. It’s like open source contributors contribute. Yeah.
 Like just, you know, start
 out with documentation and like, it’s a, it’s not magic. It
‘s a lot of work. Yeah. And,
 uh, so I’m just curious, working with, with the, uh, the
 Ruby, uh, team. I mean, you know,
 you probably have to do a lot of interaction with people
 outside the community. Um, you
 know, how’s that, how do you balance that with your, your
 action, like going to conferences
 and talking, how do you balance that with, with working
 inside of your own organization?
 Oh, uh, it’s really tough. Um, any kind of balance is
 really tough. I, I tend to be the
 kind of person that like, I get a problem and I like focus,
 like that’s all I can think
 about that one problem. Right. Uh, so a lot of force is
 really important. I, I, I, I, I,
 uh, so a lot of forced context switching, um, a lot of, uh,
 uh, I mean, even, even at,
 um, even at conferences, just like having to, having to
 partition time and saying like,
 okay, you know what? Even like I’m here, I’m still, I’m
 still meeting people. Um, one trick,
 well, maybe it’s not a trick, but at conferences, I think,
 uh, I think it’s actually a mistake
 to try to go to every single session. Right. And you know,
 even if it’s, especially if
 it’s a multi-track session or, you know, conference, uh,
 you just can’t. Uh, so I try to reserve
 percent of my time for just hallway interactions, bumping
 into people, uh, like having some
 great conversations, finding out what other people are, are
 working on. And I still love
 going to, going to the talks and hearing everything there.
 Um, but, uh, you know, so instead of
 working in my room, like I’ll work outside and if somebody
 bumps into me and asked me
 a question about something I’ve been working on or they
 want to like, Oh, I’ve, you know,
 I’ve typically the best feedback is like unsolicited
 feedback. Like somebody is like, Hey, you
 know, I didn’t like this one thing that happened.
 When I was pushing to Roku and I’m like, Oh, you know, I
 can actually do something
 about that. Like, uh, just, you know, recently we’ve had
 some, it’s like people are like,
 Oh, I’m getting bad performance. And it’s like, Oh, well
 like, let me take a look. And
 it’s like, okay, Oh, you’re, I see you’re using web brick
 in, in production. And it’s
 like, and it’s like, Oh, well I didn’t know that. And it’s
 like, it just says rails, like
 it says rail server and it’s, you know, it’s just rail
 server. And it’s like, yeah, but
 so it’s a little bit more complicated. Yeah. And it’s like,
 we, well, we, you know, and
 some warnings and some things that just, uh, this kind of
 like gradual trying to gently
 lead you to the path of happiness and Zen, you know, and
 this is a, probably a question
 on a left field, but I’m, since I mentioned Charles Nutter
 earlier, um, Hedius is a J
 Ruby, uh, maintainer. Um, the, there’s, there’s a trend
 towards, uh, moving towards, uh, using
 J Ruby or encouraging people to use J Ruby because of, uh,
 proper threading and, and,
 um, you know, uh, some of that support when you’re long
 running processes. Is that something
 that, um, like you, are you using C Ruby or are you
 starting to encourage people to look
 at J Ruby with Heroku or is that, uh, so, so we’ve
 supported J Ruby for quite a while
 actually. And, um, we, we work with Charles quite a bit. We
 also, we have, uh, we have
 Rubinius. It’s, it’s actually technically not supported,
 but, uh, but it’s still, it’s
 still runs and it, and it works. Our support is actually
 provided through the Rubinius.
 Team. Um, yeah. And, uh, so I just generally wreck
 encourage people to like play and have
 fun and like, please, like if you’re on MRI now, try MRR,
 try J Ruby. And like I’ve written
 when we first, when we first launched J Ruby, like I wrote
 docs on like migrating a rails
 app and, um, you know, just some, some things, uh, like
 even being a beat, trying that as
 a gem author, I was like, Oh wow, there’s all of these gems
 that like just don’t work
 on J Ruby.
 Because of like C extensions. And, um, and so like in the
 future, now that I’m working
 on gems, I’m very conscious of like how, like on Travis, I
 always test on J Ruby and always
 test on Rubinius.
 I was going to say like with Travis, you can have multiple
 targets. Exactly. You can, you
 can just say, test this on J Ruby or MRI one nine one eight
 two things like that. So you
 can get some of that flexibility.
 Yeah. And, and it’s also the, the, the more people who try
 it, the more people who demand
 these.
 Things that are looking for them, the more knowledge there
 is out there. It’s a lot easier
 today to switch over your app to use J Ruby. Um, I mean the
 community portion of it, typically
 my code has been relatively trivial. Most of my code just
 works and it’s, and like over
 time, like it gets faster. Uh, and so like, I think every
 app is slightly different. Uh,
 so some people just want like running, you know, fast
 scripts and like, that’s exactly
 like, you cannot beat the MRI, like boot up time.
 It is great and amazing. Like if you want to, if you can
 parallelize and you could,
 you’re actually doing real Ruby, like number crunching,
 like J Ruby and threads. Like I
 still, but I still actually recommend MRI, even though we
 have a global interpreter lock,
 it’s still not, it’s not like a, you can still write
 threaded code, especially if you’re
 using like a web server, um, or you’re on the web, like you
‘re using database calls,
 you’re hitting APIs, all these other things. Didn’t you
 create a background worker gem
 called threaded?
 Threaded or something like that.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Cause actually I, I spiked on
 that myself between sucker
 punch and, and, uh, threaded. Uh, so yeah. And being able
 to use that for background
 on, on J Ruby and save a few bucks on dynos was, yeah. Yeah
. So I had forgotten about
 that. So even, even in other smaller aspects of my NAB as,
 as popular, you’ve done a bunch
 of open source. Sorry, that was, that was, you’re talking
 about threads and I’m sitting
 there. Oh yeah. That’s.
 That’s something that’s, you know, you can do that. You don
‘t necessarily always have
 to spin up a rescue worker in a separate dyno or in, in, in
 Heroku. And, and, and that’s
 the reason I was asking about moving to J Ruby is, um, you
 know, being able to do those
 things where I can consolidate and have one, like if I don
‘t have a long running process,
 it’s going to be kind of quick, but I want to be able to
 just return my response back
 to the clients. I can, uh, you know, run this thing in a
 separate, uh, thread. And, uh,
 earlier today you had a book signing. So you’re, you’re,
 you’re moving into the world of being
 an author. You, you’re a code writer and now you’re a code
 book author.
 Yeah. A writer of many things. So the name of the book is
 Heroku up and running. It’s
 a published on O’Reilly. Also a coauthor, uh, Neil Midd
leton. He like, uh, it was, he
 actually started the book and then, and then brought me in.
 Um, so a lot of there, there’s
 some other Heroku books out there and most of them just end
 up being do this, then do
 this, then do that.
 And it’s just number one, all the majority of it is very
 technical, very rote. It’s all
 online already and there’s no explanation as to why. And we
 wanted something that was
 a little bit more timeless. Um, it’s really got into the
 philosophy and, uh, it was published
 a couple, a couple of months ago and it’s, it’s not
 outdated yet.
 Oh, really? Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That’s rare.
 It’s, it’s like, and that, it’s like, that’s the, that’s
 like the golden standard of what
 we were going for.
 It didn’t make it past the three month mark.
 Um, yeah, I, I think like just, yeah, we’re right there. So
 we’ll know in a few days whether
 or not totally like revamp these hierarchies if the book
 collapses. But, uh, and, and I’ve
 had, I’ve had some people tell me, uh, that like they
 played around a little bit with
 Heroku and there’s a, there’s a large number of things that
 they’re like, they didn’t realize
 or they knew that that was what happened, but not
 necessarily why it happened that way.
 Yeah. And even today at lunch, I was hearing one of the, uh
, other, uh, employees from
 Heroku that’s here was sitting at the table and people were
 just picking his brain and
 trying to understand. And it sounds like Heroku has done a
 great job of black boxing a lot
 and, and making a very low barrier to entry, but being able
 to go beyond that and say,
 okay, what can I really do with this, this thing that I
 have with this dino? What is,
 what is that? You know, and it’s, and these obstructions
 sometimes, you know, they’re,
 they’re good for marketing and being able to just have a
 common language. But when somebody’s
 really like, how do I get in there and do stuff and things
 I do every day, there’s a,
 you can run,
 a Heroku run bash and I can actually get a bash shell into
 like an LS and CD and, you
 know, and I did not know that. Exactly. And it’s like, I
 literally use this every single
 day. And I mean, so there’s, there’s some stuff in there
 like that, that like, it’s
 like, there’s a whole section on debugging and troubles
hooting and like, you know, things
 that you might not have known before. But I mean, like we,
 we do love the, we, we aim
 to be as easy to use as possible. Um, and kind of my goal
 in life is to make that a little
 less black boxy, uh, and, and just make it a little bit
 more user friendly. Yeah. So
 like for the 90% use cases, it’s a nice even path and it’s
 nice and well trodden. But when
 you need to go off and just LS into your bin directory and
 see what permissions are on
 some bin. Yeah. And which, you know, which bundle and all
 of these other, like, so, so
 there’s a lot of that stuff that’s being exposed in the
 book and how to do that. Yeah. Because
 to, to be frank, people, when I said, well, uh, Heroku Dyno
 is a Linux instance. I’m going
 to boot to 10. I think it’s where it’s at right now or
 something. They were like, I
 did not know. Wait, it runs on a computer. I thought it was
 literally magic. I mean,
 it’s almost like, is it, is it some kind of custom bespoke,
 you know, image that’s its
 own kernel build or something like that. Yeah. You don’t
 know, you know, it’s, it’s hard to tell those kinds
 of things unless you go in there and dig around. I had
 somebody come up to me. Oh, you, you inject
 a custom version of rails, right? No. Yeah. It’s the
 version of rails you specify. I think
 something that comes from when I would rewrite your, your
 HTML and you’re like, well, what
 really happened there? No, I just wrote a file and it went
 and also mounting some gems
 that used to do. Yeah. Yeah. That’s, that’s changed. But
 anyway, again, thank you very
 much for taking the time. Heroku up and running. Heroku up
 and running. Right. And that’s, I’m sure it’s on Amazon
 and all those places. Wherever you find books. Thank you.

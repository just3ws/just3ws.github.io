    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2015 and\n I'm sitting here with\n Trisha G who gave a talk about leveling up your automated\n tests. Thank you very\n much for taking the time to speak with me. So, leveling up\n your automated tests,\n what is, can you tell us more about that? Sure, so I, it's\n a long story I guess, but it was\n about when I had been working at a financial exchange where\n we were really\n anal about testing. We had like tests at every single level\n, we did test driven\n development, did our tests first, and I kind of got so used\n to working that way\n and I worked that way for about four years, that I assumed\n that all developers\n had evolved to work that way as well. And then I moved to a\n different project\n where we did automated testing, which is a massive step up\n from other places I've\n been in the past, but the automated testing was not as\n comprehensive as I would have liked to have seen. So, the\n talk is really about the\n story of trying to go from writing tests to tick the box of\n, yeah I wrote a test,\n to writing tests that have value, writing tests that do\n something useful,\n but not in a kind of, you must write tests kind of way, in\n a kind of way where\n as developers we go, all right this is kind of fulfilling\n if you like, or\n satisfying, or fun, or or whatever. So how do we get our\n mind into a place where\n tests is not like, oh god I have to write a test, but like,\n oh cool I get to, I get\n to experiment now, and this is where I start writing my\n experimental tests\n around the code that I've written. And it's interesting\n because I just interviewed Jay\n Fields a few minutes ago, and he talked about unselfish\n tests, and he talked\n about motivation, you know, what is your motivation for\n writing the test, and it\n sounds like that is something along the lines of what you\n're trying to figure\n out, is actually like, how do you go about evaluating what\n your motivation is?\n Right, exactly. So the talk is really around, I mean it's a\n specific journey\n that we took, and a technical solution that worked for us,\n but the talk, the\n lesson really should be the journey that we took in terms\n of looking at what\n tests can do, what you think they do, what they can give\n you, why we weren't\n doing the best job we could have done with the tests, and\n how we tackled each\n of those problems. And one of the main things is to realize\n that writing tests\n is not to check that the code that you wrote works, writing\n tests is for things\n like checking, it was to give you maintainability, read\nability,\n documentation. Yeah, does it do what I expect it to do?\n Right, does it do, yeah, does it, does it document?\n Does it, does it document what the system should do, and\n you know, does it, does it\n handle these edge cases I didn't really think of, and that\n sort of thing? Right, and you\n know, the last time we spoke you were with a different\n company, but now you're\n with JetBrains, and, and they deal with such a wide variety\n of tools, they provide\n tools for, you know, Object C, through Java, through .NET,\n I mean, is that, is that\n reflected in some of the lessons you've learned with, you\n know, how you approach\n testing? Did that?\n I mean, well, so this particular talk was based on my\n experiences at Mongo, but the\n thing was that it was quite good, so we were heavy users of\n IntelliJ IDEA, and\n when we were using Spock with Groovy, which is a language\n which was not\n familiar to us, IntelliJ IDEA really helped us with that\n stuff, because it kind of\n helped us, helped guide us towards better Groovy practices,\n and helped us to write\n tests which were, which looked right and felt right, and so\n I guess, I haven't been\n at JetBrains long enough to know the impact enough of that\n company on the testing stuff,\n but I have to say that using the JetBrains tools at Mongo\n really helped us write better,\n faster tests, and it gave us the feedback we wanted from\n the tests.\n Yeah, and going from using a tool to working at a company,\n I can't think of a better\n testimony for, for how good the tools are.\n Right.\n It's like, oh, I, I used this tool, it was so good, I want\n to work there.\n Right, exactly, and the, the great thing about working for\n JetBrains and the fact\n they make IntelliJ.\n So, I'm kind of looking at the IntelliJ stuff.\n Yeah.\n The IntelliJ tool set, plus also a bit of TeamCity and Ups\nource, and a lot of these\n kind of enterprise-type tools that generally Java\n developers will be using in the real\n world, but all the stuff that I've kind of learned as a\n Java developer is applicable\n in this role.\n Right.\n Because, you know, I've been using this tool for a long\n time.\n I know that it's great for this, and I know shortcuts are\n good for this, and I know there's\n a lot of stuff that I didn't know, and when I discovered it\n, I was like, oh, that's\n amazing, it makes my life better.\n Yeah.\n So, my job now is to take all the stuff where I thought,\n wow, that's amazing, and I'm\n going to put it on videos or on small animated GIFs and\n show it to everyone and say, look\n what you can do.\n Yeah.\n So, it's, you're getting to do a little bit more teaching.\n Yes.\n And sharing out.\n Yeah.\n So, I just drew a blank.\n It's the end of the day at the end of the conference, so,\n but the role that you're\n doing now is, you know, I want to just kind of dovetail\n into being a developer advocate\n and going on some conversations.\n Some conversations I've heard that had happened on Twitter\n that maybe described that the role\n of developer evangelist and advocate isn't quite as well\n understood by the community\n as it is.\n Can I ask you some questions about being a developer\n advocate?\n Sure.\n What is it, what is that role?\n What does that job mean?\n Okay.\n So, I will answer it from my point of view.\n Okay, yeah.\n And one of the interesting things about developer advocate,\n developer evangelist is that it\n depends from job to job and from company to company, so, at\n MongoDB, what was very important\n to us was as evangelists, we were proper developers.\n We worked full-time normally on a code base that was used,\n for example, in my case, it\n was the MongoDB Java driver, and we would go out and talk\n about MongoDB the server and\n the Java driver.\n And that's great, but you end up getting torn in two\n directions because you sort of have\n this full-time coding job, which is necessary because you\n need to have the, what's the word?\n Practical.\n Yeah.\n I'm thinking in Spanish now.\n I don't even know Spanish.\n You need to be--\n Practical?\n No.\n You need to be reputable and developers need to believe\n that you understand about development.\n But to be doing development, proper full-time development\n and traveling and creating content\n and writing blog posts and stuff is a lot of work.\n Right.\n So, at JetBrains, my role is much more around the, like you\n say, the educational\n side of stuff.\n So, I'm still doing coding.\n I'm still contributing, actually, to Morphea and to MongoDB\n.\n Because they're open-source projects.\n Okay.\n I'm still writing my own projects.\n So, here I get to write projects which demonstrate\n something in particular.\n So, I've got a project which demonstrates Java 8, Lambdas,\n and Streams with, like, tiny,\n tiny services that you might call micro-sized.\n I've heard that term floating around in this conference.\n So, I've been writing some codes that demonstrate\n particular things.\n So, I really like, well, I wanted to see how Java 8 works\n in real life.\n Right.\n So, I needed a real Java 8 project, which I created.\n And I wanted to see how IntelliVentures works.\n And I wanted to see how Java 8 works in real life.\n Right.\n So, I needed a real Java 8 project, which I created.\n Right.\n And I wanted to see how IntelliVentures works in real life.\n Right.\n And I wanted to see how IntelliJ helps you write Java 8\n code.\n Okay.\n So, I created that code for that.\n So, it kind of lets you drill into a certain sector of a\n topic.\n Right.\n And I can continue to maintain this, but I don't need to\n because no one else is using\n it.\n It's kind of fulfilled a goal.\n And I can now write a bunch of stuff around this.\n So, I have a talk around it, but I also can write some blog\n posts or I've also used it\n to create some screencasts to say, \"Look, if you want to do\n some shortcuts in IntelliJ\n around creating Lambdas, you can do this.\"\n Mm-hmm.\n It's a real code that works to demonstrate that.\n So, a little bit of research and experimentation that might\n not have been in a job where you're\n like, \"Oh, I got a deadline and I have to deliver this\n feature.\"\n Right.\n So, \"Oh, and I also have to write a blog post.\"\n Right.\n Exactly.\n It's more like, \"What can I write a blog post about?\"\n Yes.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n So, that's interesting how it kind of flips that on the\n head.\n Is that a common thing for developer advocates across...\nbecause you said you put the caveat.\n You're describing your situation.\n Right.\n Right.\n How does that maybe different...\n I think some of the companies put...\n Some of the companies put more focus on content.\n I mean, content takes quite a long time to come up with.\n If I'm going to write a blog post about Java 8 features,\n for example, that could take...\n I mean, it could take weeks, you know?\n Right.\n To put together a good blog post.\n So, some companies focus more on that sort of content.\n Some companies, like I say, a bit more like Mongo, you tend\n to have a proper engineering\n role where you also have to deliver something engineering-\nwise.\n And for some companies, the developer advocate role is a\n role within marketing, and for some\n companies, it's a role within engineering.\n For JetBrains, it is its own organization, which we talk to\n the product owners for each\n of the individual products, because we have to...and even\n developers for the products.\n So we have very close ties to the engineering team, but we\n're also outside of marketing,\n so we talk to the marketing guys, too.\n And that's nice.\n That allows us to balance...because marketing and\n engineering are two...have two differing\n goals, if you like.\n Yeah.\n Yeah, slightly.\n One is to, like, deliver the product, and the other is to\n tell a story around the product.\n Yeah.\n And...but the engineering will get the product done when it\n's ready.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n And marketing deadlines are slightly different.\n Yeah.\n And being sat in the middle allows us to kind of balance\n those things up.\n But we do have deadlines, as well.\n Our deadlines aren't, like, your boss saying, \"Deliver this\n feature by X,\" but our deadlines\n are, for example, there's going to be a new release of Ups\nource next week, so I need to\n get a screencast of the new features in Upsource done by\n the end of...by, yeah, Tuesday next\n week.\n So you live a little bit closer to product cycles...\n Yeah.\n Yeah, definitely.\n ...versus just marketing initiatives.\n Right.\n I mean, but it's still a dovetail.\n It still dovetails into a marketing initiative.\n Right.\n But it's kind of once the engineering team have done what\n they're supposed to do, and\n we get involved with them earlier on, so I'm using early\n access versions of, like, most\n of the software, so I can also...I often end up feeding\n back, you know, occasional bugs\n come up.\n Yeah.\n Because that's the point about an early access program,\n right?\n Yeah, yeah.\n You're pushing the boundaries in some places.\n Yeah.\n So I'm, like, trying to figure out how new features work,\n and I'm, like, saying, \"Oh,\n this doesn't appear to work,\" and often it's me going, \"Oh,\n I didn't really get the right\n angle.\"\n Yeah.\n ...for that feature.\n Or sometimes it's, like, \"Oh, we haven't quite thought of\n that,\" or maybe we can replace\n it this way.\n Mm-hmm.\n So I get to feed stuff back in there as well.\n So that's quite cool because it's...well, I mean, it's more\n like being a user than a\n developer, but...so I get to input a little bit into that.\n Yeah.\n But also, being a developer, you're quite sympathetic.\n You're not, like, \"It doesn't work.\n It's a bug.\"\n Yeah.\n You're, like, \"Well, I'm trying to document this feature,\n and I'm not really sure how\n it works.\"\n Yeah.\n And then you speak to the developers, and they're, like, \"\nOh, it should be like this.\"\n And you're, like, \"Okay, great.\"\n And then because they can explain to me what it's supposed\n to do, and I can think, \"How\n would a developer use this?\"\n Then I can document it or screencast it or whatever in a\n way which will hopefully make\n it usable for future users.\n Okay.\n Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with\n me.\n Thank you very much.\n Thanks.",

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015 and
 I’m sitting here with
 Trisha G who gave a talk about leveling up your automated
 tests. Thank you very
 much for taking the time to speak with me. So, leveling up
 your automated tests,
 what is, can you tell us more about that? Sure, so I, it’s
 a long story I guess, but it was
 about when I had been working at a financial exchange where
 we were really
 anal about testing. We had like tests at every single level
, we did test driven
 development, did our tests first, and I kind of got so used
 to working that way
 and I worked that way for about four years, that I assumed
 that all developers
 had evolved to work that way as well. And then I moved to a
 different project
 where we did automated testing, which is a massive step up
 from other places I’ve
 been in the past, but the automated testing was not as
 comprehensive as I would have liked to have seen. So, the
 talk is really about the
 story of trying to go from writing tests to tick the box of
, yeah I wrote a test,
 to writing tests that have value, writing tests that do
 something useful,
 but not in a kind of, you must write tests kind of way, in
 a kind of way where
 as developers we go, all right this is kind of fulfilling
 if you like, or
 satisfying, or fun, or or whatever. So how do we get our
 mind into a place where
 tests is not like, oh god I have to write a test, but like,
 oh cool I get to, I get
 to experiment now, and this is where I start writing my
 experimental tests
 around the code that I’ve written. And it’s interesting
 because I just interviewed Jay
 Fields a few minutes ago, and he talked about unselfish
 tests, and he talked
 about motivation, you know, what is your motivation for
 writing the test, and it
 sounds like that is something along the lines of what you
‘re trying to figure
 out, is actually like, how do you go about evaluating what
 your motivation is?
 Right, exactly. So the talk is really around, I mean it’s a
 specific journey
 that we took, and a technical solution that worked for us,
 but the talk, the
 lesson really should be the journey that we took in terms
 of looking at what
 tests can do, what you think they do, what they can give
 you, why we weren’t
 doing the best job we could have done with the tests, and
 how we tackled each
 of those problems. And one of the main things is to realize
 that writing tests
 is not to check that the code that you wrote works, writing
 tests is for things
 like checking, it was to give you maintainability, read
ability,
 documentation. Yeah, does it do what I expect it to do?
 Right, does it do, yeah, does it, does it document?
 Does it, does it document what the system should do, and
 you know, does it, does it
 handle these edge cases I didn’t really think of, and that
 sort of thing? Right, and you
 know, the last time we spoke you were with a different
 company, but now you’re
 with JetBrains, and, and they deal with such a wide variety
 of tools, they provide
 tools for, you know, Object C, through Java, through .NET,
 I mean, is that, is that
 reflected in some of the lessons you’ve learned with, you
 know, how you approach
 testing? Did that?
 I mean, well, so this particular talk was based on my
 experiences at Mongo, but the
 thing was that it was quite good, so we were heavy users of
 IntelliJ IDEA, and
 when we were using Spock with Groovy, which is a language
 which was not
 familiar to us, IntelliJ IDEA really helped us with that
 stuff, because it kind of
 helped us, helped guide us towards better Groovy practices,
 and helped us to write
 tests which were, which looked right and felt right, and so
 I guess, I haven’t been
 at JetBrains long enough to know the impact enough of that
 company on the testing stuff,
 but I have to say that using the JetBrains tools at Mongo
 really helped us write better,
 faster tests, and it gave us the feedback we wanted from
 the tests.
 Yeah, and going from using a tool to working at a company,
 I can’t think of a better
 testimony for, for how good the tools are.
 Right.
 It’s like, oh, I, I used this tool, it was so good, I want
 to work there.
 Right, exactly, and the, the great thing about working for
 JetBrains and the fact
 they make IntelliJ.
 So, I’m kind of looking at the IntelliJ stuff.
 Yeah.
 The IntelliJ tool set, plus also a bit of TeamCity and Ups
ource, and a lot of these
 kind of enterprise-type tools that generally Java
 developers will be using in the real
 world, but all the stuff that I’ve kind of learned as a
 Java developer is applicable
 in this role.
 Right.
 Because, you know, I’ve been using this tool for a long
 time.
 I know that it’s great for this, and I know shortcuts are
 good for this, and I know there’s
 a lot of stuff that I didn’t know, and when I discovered it
, I was like, oh, that’s
 amazing, it makes my life better.
 Yeah.
 So, my job now is to take all the stuff where I thought,
 wow, that’s amazing, and I’m
 going to put it on videos or on small animated GIFs and
 show it to everyone and say, look
 what you can do.
 Yeah.
 So, it’s, you’re getting to do a little bit more teaching.
 Yes.
 And sharing out.
 Yeah.
 So, I just drew a blank.
 It’s the end of the day at the end of the conference, so,
 but the role that you’re
 doing now is, you know, I want to just kind of dovetail
 into being a developer advocate
 and going on some conversations.
 Some conversations I’ve heard that had happened on Twitter
 that maybe described that the role
 of developer evangelist and advocate isn’t quite as well
 understood by the community
 as it is.
 Can I ask you some questions about being a developer
 advocate?
 Sure.
 What is it, what is that role?
 What does that job mean?
 Okay.
 So, I will answer it from my point of view.
 Okay, yeah.
 And one of the interesting things about developer advocate,
 developer evangelist is that it
 depends from job to job and from company to company, so, at
 MongoDB, what was very important
 to us was as evangelists, we were proper developers.
 We worked full-time normally on a code base that was used,
 for example, in my case, it
 was the MongoDB Java driver, and we would go out and talk
 about MongoDB the server and
 the Java driver.
 And that’s great, but you end up getting torn in two
 directions because you sort of have
 this full-time coding job, which is necessary because you
 need to have the, what’s the word?
 Practical.
 Yeah.
 I’m thinking in Spanish now.
 I don’t even know Spanish.
 You need to be–
 Practical?
 No.
 You need to be reputable and developers need to believe
 that you understand about development.
 But to be doing development, proper full-time development
 and traveling and creating content
 and writing blog posts and stuff is a lot of work.
 Right.
 So, at JetBrains, my role is much more around the, like you
 say, the educational
 side of stuff.
 So, I’m still doing coding.
 I’m still contributing, actually, to Morphea and to MongoDB
.
 Because they’re open-source projects.
 Okay.
 I’m still writing my own projects.
 So, here I get to write projects which demonstrate
 something in particular.
 So, I’ve got a project which demonstrates Java 8, Lambdas,
 and Streams with, like, tiny,
 tiny services that you might call micro-sized.
 I’ve heard that term floating around in this conference.
 So, I’ve been writing some codes that demonstrate
 particular things.
 So, I really like, well, I wanted to see how Java 8 works
 in real life.
 Right.
 So, I needed a real Java 8 project, which I created.
 And I wanted to see how IntelliVentures works.
 And I wanted to see how Java 8 works in real life.
 Right.
 So, I needed a real Java 8 project, which I created.
 Right.
 And I wanted to see how IntelliVentures works in real life.
 Right.
 And I wanted to see how IntelliJ helps you write Java 8
 code.
 Okay.
 So, I created that code for that.
 So, it kind of lets you drill into a certain sector of a
 topic.
 Right.
 And I can continue to maintain this, but I don’t need to
 because no one else is using
 it.
 It’s kind of fulfilled a goal.
 And I can now write a bunch of stuff around this.
 So, I have a talk around it, but I also can write some blog
 posts or I’ve also used it
 to create some screencasts to say, “Look, if you want to do
 some shortcuts in IntelliJ
 around creating Lambdas, you can do this.”
 Mm-hmm.
 It’s a real code that works to demonstrate that.
 So, a little bit of research and experimentation that might
 not have been in a job where you’re
 like, “Oh, I got a deadline and I have to deliver this
 feature.”
 Right.
 So, “Oh, and I also have to write a blog post.”
 Right.
 Exactly.
 It’s more like, “What can I write a blog post about?”
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So, that’s interesting how it kind of flips that on the
 head.
 Is that a common thing for developer advocates across…
because you said you put the caveat.
 You’re describing your situation.
 Right.
 Right.
 How does that maybe different…
 I think some of the companies put…
 Some of the companies put more focus on content.
 I mean, content takes quite a long time to come up with.
 If I’m going to write a blog post about Java 8 features,
 for example, that could take…
 I mean, it could take weeks, you know?
 Right.
 To put together a good blog post.
 So, some companies focus more on that sort of content.
 Some companies, like I say, a bit more like Mongo, you tend
 to have a proper engineering
 role where you also have to deliver something engineering-
wise.
 And for some companies, the developer advocate role is a
 role within marketing, and for some
 companies, it’s a role within engineering.
 For JetBrains, it is its own organization, which we talk to
 the product owners for each
 of the individual products, because we have to…and even
 developers for the products.
 So we have very close ties to the engineering team, but we
‘re also outside of marketing,
 so we talk to the marketing guys, too.
 And that’s nice.
 That allows us to balance…because marketing and
 engineering are two…have two differing
 goals, if you like.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, slightly.
 One is to, like, deliver the product, and the other is to
 tell a story around the product.
 Yeah.
 And…but the engineering will get the product done when it
‘s ready.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And marketing deadlines are slightly different.
 Yeah.
 And being sat in the middle allows us to kind of balance
 those things up.
 But we do have deadlines, as well.
 Our deadlines aren’t, like, your boss saying, “Deliver this
 feature by X,” but our deadlines
 are, for example, there’s going to be a new release of Ups
ource next week, so I need to
 get a screencast of the new features in Upsource done by
 the end of…by, yeah, Tuesday next
 week.
 So you live a little bit closer to product cycles…
 Yeah.
 Yeah, definitely.
 …versus just marketing initiatives.
 Right.
 I mean, but it’s still a dovetail.
 It still dovetails into a marketing initiative.
 Right.
 But it’s kind of once the engineering team have done what
 they’re supposed to do, and
 we get involved with them earlier on, so I’m using early
 access versions of, like, most
 of the software, so I can also…I often end up feeding
 back, you know, occasional bugs
 come up.
 Yeah.
 Because that’s the point about an early access program,
 right?
 Yeah, yeah.
 You’re pushing the boundaries in some places.
 Yeah.
 So I’m, like, trying to figure out how new features work,
 and I’m, like, saying, “Oh,
 this doesn’t appear to work,” and often it’s me going, “Oh,
 I didn’t really get the right
 angle.”
 Yeah.
 …for that feature.
 Or sometimes it’s, like, “Oh, we haven’t quite thought of
 that,” or maybe we can replace
 it this way.
 Mm-hmm.
 So I get to feed stuff back in there as well.
 So that’s quite cool because it’s…well, I mean, it’s more
 like being a user than a
 developer, but…so I get to input a little bit into that.
 Yeah.
 But also, being a developer, you’re quite sympathetic.
 You’re not, like, “It doesn’t work.
 It’s a bug.”
 Yeah.
 You’re, like, “Well, I’m trying to document this feature,
 and I’m not really sure how
 it works.”
 Yeah.
 And then you speak to the developers, and they’re, like, “
Oh, it should be like this.”
 And you’re, like, “Okay, great.”
 And then because they can explain to me what it’s supposed
 to do, and I can think, “How
 would a developer use this?”
 Then I can document it or screencast it or whatever in a
 way which will hopefully make
 it usable for future users.
 Okay.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 Thank you very much.
 Thanks.</p>

      <p>1 interview in the archive.</p>
      
        <p>Fred George is a developer and co&shy;founder at&nbsp; Outpace Systems , and has been writing code for over 45 years in (by his count) over 70 languages. He has delivered projects and products across his career, and in the last decade alone, has worked in the US, India, China, and the UK. He started ThoughtWorks University in Bangalore, India, based on a commercial programming training program he developed in the 90&rsquo;s. An early adopter of OO and Agile, Fred continues to impact the industry with his leading&shy;edge ideas, most recently advocating Micro&shy;Service Architectures and flat team structures (under the moniker of Programmer Anarchy). Oh, and he still writes code!&nbsp; Twitter: @fgeorge52</p>

              <br>Programmer Anarchy is a post&shy;Agile process that focuses on empowering programmers by eliminating roles that interfere with domain knowledge and assumption of day&shy;to&shy;day decisions by the programmers. Originally conceived in a startup environment at Forward Internet Group in London, Programmer Anarchy is now being implemented in a traditional IT shop for an established company: MailOnline, the online newspaper arm of the Daily Mail of London. This discussion will talk about the introduction of Anarchy into a Scrum shop, the training, the transition of roles, and the redesign of HR roles.

              <br>While micro-services are all the rage, they need to be approached with caution. Using the techniques of evolutionary architecture, coupled with continuous delivery, allows for the micro-services architecture and its companion data architecture to evolve. This talk explores the relationship between these three concepts, focusing on how they all support each other in the creation of complex systems.

              <br>Apache Spark has been blessed as the replacement for MapReduce in Hadoop environments. It also runs in other deployment modes. Spark provides better performance, better developer productivity, and it supports a wider range of application scenarios than MapReduce, including event stream processing, ad hoc queries, graphs, and iterative algorithms. Graphs are a natural way to represent many data sets, such as social media networks, and iterative algorithms are important for Machine Learning, such as model training with gradient descent.

    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike here with UGtastic. I'm sitting down with Avdi Grim who runs the\n Ruby Tapas and the Ruby Rogues and the, excuse me, the Wide Teams blogs and\n podcasts. He also does this very interesting thing where he'll remote\n pair with people on open source projects and also some paid projects. Avdi,\n thank you for taking the time to sit down. Can you tell me a little bit about\n how you got started doing these remote pairs and and how that's been working\n out for you? Well, thanks for having me. So, the remote pairing, just, I don't know,\n I think it seemed like a natural progression, honestly. I had been\n working remotely for a long time. That's just been sort of one of my\n long-term intentions was to work from home because I like being around my\n family and I like choosing where I live based on other things, you know,\n besides being in a tech hub or something like that. So, I'm out in sort of\n suburban Pennsylvania here. And so, I've been working remotely for a long time\n for various companies and I am also a fan of pair programming because I've\n seen how effective it can be for spreading practices throughout a group\n and, you know, for keeping everyone on the same page and keeping\n the bus number down and stuff like that. So, you know, I've been, so, you\n know, the kind of the natural thing was I'd been pairing within companies that\n I'd worked with or for remotely for a long time. And at one point this summer, I\n found myself with the opportunity of taking another traditional consulting\n gig, but I had been really feeling the pressure, the pressure on my time from\n the consulting gigs that I had. I felt like I wasn't able to move forward on\n some projects that I wanted to get going, like Ruby Tapas. And I wanted\n something that would be more flexible, something that, you know, it wouldn't be,\n wouldn't be, you know, hours and hours and hours a day and also where I didn't have\n to feel like, like getting a, you know, like getting, getting the, the product\n shipped was dependent on me working overtime and stuff like that. I wanted to\n be able to, to actually like, you know, have a good cutoff with the work that I\n was doing for people. And that can be hard sometimes, even with consulting, it\n can be hard to, to sort of draw that, you know, draw those boundaries. And so I, I had, I,\n I had already been taking some sort of some ad hoc pair programming appointments\n and, and not as an intentional thing, but just some people had gotten in touch with\n me. You know, people that I knew from, from, from other things had just said,\n Hey, can I, could we set up a thing where I pay you and we just do remote pairing\n from time to time? You know, and usually somebody that wasn't typically people\n that didn't have a good, like they weren't in a company that had a lot of other Ruby\n programmers, you know, maybe they were the only program or maybe they were consulting like our sole consultant.\n For something like that. And they wanted to work with somebody else, you know, to, to just both for the\n company and, and to hone their skills and stuff like that. And, and so I've been doing that for a few\n people and I thought, you know, they seem to be getting a lot out of it and coming back. And so\n what if I just did more of that instead of the traditional consulting? And so I, you know, I took\n some time to cut, like, think about like, what would that look like? You know, and, and sort of, and write\n up some, some copy about, you know, the sort of things that I could, I could\n consult on as a, as a consulting pair programmer. And, and then I just kind of\n put my shingle out there and I have been, you know, basically flooded with, with\n requests for appointments ever since.\n Oh, okay. And, I mean, do you mostly get open source projects or do you get a lot\n of, of, of paid work through this as well?\n I think I would say, I think I get more submissions\n for paid work than I, I get for open, open source work. Now, I, I do have to, I, I run a, a\n backlog for the open source work just because I'm not able to do as many of those appointments. I do\n those for free. I do free pay, pair programming if it's, if it's on open source software and, and I'd\n love to be able to do more than I do, but right now I can only do one a week because it's, you know, it\n doesn't pay the bills.\n Right. And I'm kind of curious, you know, Gary Bernhard, I interviewed him over a\n SCNA and he's talked about how doing the destroy all software, he has people just sending him\n requests and, and, and saying, you know, can you look at this code, can analyze it?\n And they kind of an expectation that he can do all that.\n Do you get that with the pair program?\n Do you ever get people saying, hey, why don't you have time for, for my project?\n Or has it been pretty like congenial?\n What has your been your experience?\n No, it's, it's, it's, it's been extremely genial.\n I, I, anybody who follows me on Twitter.\n Well, first of all, knows that I tweet way too much, but also knows that like somewhere between\n like, you know, like once a week or to once a month, I tweet the same line over and over again.\n I get the nicest emails.\n Yes.\n And, and it's because I do and I keep tweeting that because it keeps happening.\n You know, I honestly, the, the Ruby community is fantastic.\n And, and I don't know what it is, but, but I get, you know, for what I get is, is just the\n nicest things that people, people say.\n And, and I don't really, I occasionally, I've had people, I've had, you know, I, I get a\n lot of requests for, can you give me some advice?\n Now I'd say more often, it's more like career advice than it is like, can you fix this code?\n Okay.\n But, you know, I try to get back to everyone, you know, sometimes I'll say, look, I, I'm sorry.\n I, I tried to look at this, but I just didn't have time to really dig into it.\n Right.\n But for, but I, I know, I, I wouldn't say I get a ton of people being like,\n can you, you know, please fix my code now.\n Okay.\n Yeah.\n Yes.\n That was a, that was one thing I had to wonder is like, how much is a signal to noise?\n Do you get on these requests for, you know, where somebody like, you remember, I don't\n know if you ever looked at old code project or anything like that.\n Some of the older code sites where people would go in and basically post, um, or no, it\n was, uh, the guru, um, sites for, can you do my homework for me?\n Kind of requests.\n Um, I just wondered if you got those kinds of things, um, but, uh, um, the, the, the\n weird.\n Every now and then I get like somebody, the, the, the most common, the most common sort\n of like missing request that kind of misses the target is, is I'll get a request that\n says for an open source pairing session that says, I, I want some tutoring, you know, I,\n I like, I want to pass this test and I'd like some tutoring and I have to say, look, the,\n the open source pairing sessions are really for putting code back into the community.\n Right.\n Uh, so like if you have a project that you own or that you want to.\n Uh, you know, commit, commit to not commit to, but, you know, make some submissions to,\n uh, that's open source, you know, that's, that's really what that's for.\n It's not really about me teaching.\n Yeah.\n So it's not, uh, really code 101.\n It's more of, you kind of have to have some, at least basic, uh, experience with programming\n and be almost there.\n It just may be a little bit of guidance or, or something that you need.\n Yeah.\n I mean, I do a lot of tutoring, a lot of training and tutoring.\n But that's pretty much under the, the content in the context of paid sessions.\n Okay.\n Uh, because, you know, it's, it's, I mean, it's tiring and it's, it takes, um, it takes\n a lot out, out of someone to, you know, to do that kind of, that kind of work.\n And I, I kind of look to the open source sessions to be a bit more relaxing, um, a bit more,\n you know, a bit more fun because, Hey, it's, you know, it's working open source code and\n that's, that's awesome.\n And so going over to, uh, uh, some of the,\n the more public stuff that you do, that's the, the Ruby, uh, uh, rogues.\n That's, uh, a pretty popular podcast.\n I seen, um, uh, Jim gray is, is trying to really get it elected to the, to the best\n podcast of the year.\n He's been tweeting about that a lot, but it's always a pretty enjoyable interview.\n And, um, I, matter of fact, I listened to your, uh, most recent interview, at least\n the first part of it where, uh, you guys have this kind of, um, um, banter.\n Uh, and, uh, there was something about jokes that can't be made.\n Uh, Jim, uh, Jim gray, I believe, uh, said something about, we can't say these certain\n types of jokes.\n And, and then immediately somebody made a joke about, um, back at Jim about, you know,\n the wheelchair or something like that.\n I was about standing desks and it was, you know, only friends can do that kind of thing.\n Yes.\n And, uh, and, and that's really what it sounds like on that podcast, you know, um, how, how\n did you guys come to start that cast?\n And, uh, well, let me, let me be clear here.\n I, I, I'm a late comer to that podcast.\n I'm, I'm the most recent addition to that, to that group.\n Okay.\n Um, and so as far as I know, so it's, it's Chuck's podcast, you know, he, he put it together\n initially and, um, I actually don't know the details of the early history.\n I can't remember who exactly was there at the beginning.\n I know, I'm pretty sure it was, it was Chuck and, um, and James.\n Um, and I'm not sure who else, um, at the beginning, I'd have to go back and look at\n some of the early episodes to see.\n And I know that they, you know, they added some, some folks along the way and then, and\n for a while there, um, before I came on, um, uh, Aaron Patterson was a regular.\n Okay.\n And, uh, you know, which is awesome, but, um, I, I came on for an episode, um, and then\n they, you know, I, I did.\n I didn't, I, I, I guess I didn't insult them enough and, and, and they, they had me back,\n um, for another episode.\n And at some point, um, Aaron said, decided that he just didn't have time to devote to\n that podcast every week.\n And at that point they, I, I basically took Aaron's slot, which, which, uh, is kind of\n a big seat to fill.\n Yeah.\n It is tender love.\n So, um, well then I'd like to just jump straight over to the distributed.\n Team or the Y team, excuse me.\n So, uh, apparently you, or I should say not apparently, but it really seems that you do\n have a passion for remote, uh, uh, uh, collaboration.\n Yeah.\n And, um, I have not yet listened to the Y teams.\n I saw it and it was kind of the day I, that I, I decided I had to contact you to talk\n because I was, I was working on you fantastic and I was not feeling good about something.\n And I saw it.\n I saw another Ruby tapas had come out and then I'm like, Hmm, uh, wow.\n Yeah.\n He's got Ruby tapas and, uh, and Ruby rogues.\n And then there was something, you tweeted something about Y teams.\n I was like, and then I went and looked at your bio.\n I'm like, this guy is like a, uh, between them and the books.\n I didn't even mention the books.\n Um, what have you learned through the, uh, the, the Y teams and what kind of was your\n inspiration for doing that?\n Well, the inspiration is just, you know, uh, I work remotely and I probably always.\n Will, because I want to live where I want to live with my family and, and, and I don't,\n you know, so, you know, my, I, a few years ago I thought to myself, you know, what is\n the best way to, to, you know, I felt like, you know, if, if I'm going to make a career\n out of working remotely with other software developers, it behooves me to become good\n at it.\n And I figured the best way to do that would be to talk to a lot of other people who are\n doing it and, you know, pick their brains.\n And, you know, and I also just felt like, you know, when I was looking around back then,\n I, I thought, you know, that didn't seem like there were a lot of good resources out there\n for, you know, there were a lot of people doing it.\n There are a lot of people doing different kinds of, of remote work arrangements, whether\n fully distributed or just like, you know, there's, you know, a main team and then there's\n some satellite people or whatever.\n A lot of these things were going on, but there weren't any resources where they were getting\n together and talking to each other.\n And so wide teams has always been, you know, the\n dream for that has always been to build a community around the practice of, of dispersed\n teams and remote work.\n So if somebody was going to sit down and grab and listen to one episode, is there any one\n particular interview that you got a lot of wisdom from or?\n I think I would have to get back to you on that one.\n That's a, that's a really tough one to answer.\n You know, I know a lot of people really enjoyed the Chad Fowler.\n Interview.\n But, you know, truth be told, there have been so many good ones.\n It's, it's, it's hard to narrow it down.\n Here's the question then.\n Is it one of the things sitting down with user group people and people involved in technical\n communities, I've seen certain patterns that have emerged in the way different people approach\n the community community.\n Have you seen that with the wide teams?\n It's like been like, oh, I've talked to these 20, 30, 50 people and some patterns have emerged.\n Is that.\n And something you've seen.\n I think a lot of people are, are in fairly similar situations.\n I mean, you have a lot of startups that, that, you know, they have, they have people in them\n that wanted to work together, you know, maybe they had all worked together at a previous\n company, but then they went their separate ways and, you know, different parts of the\n country or the world, you know, but they still wanted to work together.\n You've got some groups like that.\n You have more established companies that are just realizing that they don't have enough\n local talent to fill the slots.\n You know, that they want to, you know, to, to do the work they want to get done.\n And so they're trying to hire people from wherever the talent is rather than, than just in their\n local area.\n And, you know, and, and various things in between there.\n But I mean, those are some of the trends that I see.\n Okay.\n And, and just kind of to come to an, well, I actually have two more questions.\n One is, I'll just go with the equipment first.\n Because I'm.\n I'm curious as well.\n And I'm sure other people who are going to be working remotely, I'm curious for different\n reasons.\n I'm just interested about the setup you use for recording, and I'm sure you use some of\n this for your remoting work as well.\n What kind of microphone and stand and setup do you use for, for.\n So for recording, what I'm talking to right now is my, my blue snowball, which is the\n kind of the, I think it's probably one of the most recommended, you know, podcast recording\n mics out there for, if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg, you know, it's, it's USB,\n which is wonderful because you don't have to worry about like, like interference on the\n analog cables.\n And so that's that my stand is just some cheap stand that I had lying around in my, in my\n attic, you know, and I've got, I've got a pop filter that I got along with them like,\n and let's see what else.\n As far as like remote pairing stuff.\n What do you want to just know about like audio equipment or equipment in general?\n Just what do you use for communications?\n Do you, do you have a camera open regularly or do you, I try to have video going and here's\n what I do.\n Let me, I'm going to try to rotate this and hopefully this won't come tumbling down.\n If you look over to my right over here.\n Well, one thing you see is a mess, but let's see.\n If we can get this far enough over, let's see, you can just sort of see the corner.\n There it is.\n The corner of my tablet, which is mounted on a mount, which holds it up in the air.\n Okay, to my right.\n And what I try to do, I try to use my tablet as my primary comms device and it's, you know,\n so I've got Skype and, and, and Google+.\n And, and, uh, Google talk on it.\n And so I'll try to have the person that I'm working with on my, like over here, uh, on\n the tablet and I can look over to them and there's their, their face on video.\n Assuming we've got a decent enough connection.\n Um, you know, I spring for, for business broadband, but not everyone has, has a good connection\n and, and sometimes the internet has bad days.\n But, but, um, you know, I have them over here and then I usually have the screen share that\n we're working on.\n In front of me on my computer.\n So it's a little bit more natural than like the, the, the, like staring back at each other\n kind of set up where you're both, um, you know, where you're using the camera on your\n work laptop thing.\n Uh, and I, I kind of like that.\n It also takes some of the, the hardware load off of the PC that I'm working on.\n Yeah.\n And then you don't have to worry about a reboot or anything like that.\n Right.\n For, um, for that I've been lately, I've been using a, um, a\n VXI, uh, uh, blue parrot, uh, B two 50 XT plus, uh, which is a headset.\n It's a Bluetooth headset that is mainly designed as I understand it for truckers.\n Um, it's got ridiculously long battery life.\n It's got like 20 hours of, of talk time and a, uh, and it's got a fairly aggressive, um, noise\n control, you know, for, for surround, like not picking up on surrounding noises.\n Yeah, that would, that would be kind of necessary.\n In a truck.\n They're pretty loud.\n Yeah, but you know, it's nice for me because like a lot of the Bluetooth headsets out there\n are, they're, they're mainly, they're oriented towards people making occasional calls.\n They're not oriented towards somebody sitting for, you know, two, four, six, eight hours\n at a time and working with somebody else.\n And, uh, and so that's why I got that and that's been working out pretty well.\n And kind of where I'm going to end, uh, the final question is working from home, working\n remotely, uh, you're disconnected a little bit from, um, the banter.\n The, the chat in, in a normal office, you're more of a person who's on the edge of technology.\n You don't really, I should say, you know, Ruby and, and the, and the tools you're using,\n uh, might not necessarily have to depend on, uh, user groups

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike here with UGtastic. I’m sitting down with Avdi Grim who runs the
 Ruby Tapas and the Ruby Rogues and the, excuse me, the Wide Teams blogs and
 podcasts. He also does this very interesting thing where he’ll remote
 pair with people on open source projects and also some paid projects. Avdi,
 thank you for taking the time to sit down. Can you tell me a little bit about
 how you got started doing these remote pairs and and how that’s been working
 out for you? Well, thanks for having me. So, the remote pairing, just, I don’t know,
 I think it seemed like a natural progression, honestly. I had been
 working remotely for a long time. That’s just been sort of one of my
 long-term intentions was to work from home because I like being around my
 family and I like choosing where I live based on other things, you know,
 besides being in a tech hub or something like that. So, I’m out in sort of
 suburban Pennsylvania here. And so, I’ve been working remotely for a long time
 for various companies and I am also a fan of pair programming because I’ve
 seen how effective it can be for spreading practices throughout a group
 and, you know, for keeping everyone on the same page and keeping
 the bus number down and stuff like that. So, you know, I’ve been, so, you
 know, the kind of the natural thing was I’d been pairing within companies that
 I’d worked with or for remotely for a long time. And at one point this summer, I
 found myself with the opportunity of taking another traditional consulting
 gig, but I had been really feeling the pressure, the pressure on my time from
 the consulting gigs that I had. I felt like I wasn’t able to move forward on
 some projects that I wanted to get going, like Ruby Tapas. And I wanted
 something that would be more flexible, something that, you know, it wouldn’t be,
 wouldn’t be, you know, hours and hours and hours a day and also where I didn’t have
 to feel like, like getting a, you know, like getting, getting the, the product
 shipped was dependent on me working overtime and stuff like that. I wanted to
 be able to, to actually like, you know, have a good cutoff with the work that I
 was doing for people. And that can be hard sometimes, even with consulting, it
 can be hard to, to sort of draw that, you know, draw those boundaries. And so I, I had, I,
 I had already been taking some sort of some ad hoc pair programming appointments
 and, and not as an intentional thing, but just some people had gotten in touch with
 me. You know, people that I knew from, from, from other things had just said,
 Hey, can I, could we set up a thing where I pay you and we just do remote pairing
 from time to time? You know, and usually somebody that wasn’t typically people
 that didn’t have a good, like they weren’t in a company that had a lot of other Ruby
 programmers, you know, maybe they were the only program or maybe they were consulting like our sole consultant.
 For something like that. And they wanted to work with somebody else, you know, to, to just both for the
 company and, and to hone their skills and stuff like that. And, and so I’ve been doing that for a few
 people and I thought, you know, they seem to be getting a lot out of it and coming back. And so
 what if I just did more of that instead of the traditional consulting? And so I, you know, I took
 some time to cut, like, think about like, what would that look like? You know, and, and sort of, and write
 up some, some copy about, you know, the sort of things that I could, I could
 consult on as a, as a consulting pair programmer. And, and then I just kind of
 put my shingle out there and I have been, you know, basically flooded with, with
 requests for appointments ever since.
 Oh, okay. And, I mean, do you mostly get open source projects or do you get a lot
 of, of, of paid work through this as well?
 I think I would say, I think I get more submissions
 for paid work than I, I get for open, open source work. Now, I, I do have to, I, I run a, a
 backlog for the open source work just because I’m not able to do as many of those appointments. I do
 those for free. I do free pay, pair programming if it’s, if it’s on open source software and, and I’d
 love to be able to do more than I do, but right now I can only do one a week because it’s, you know, it
 doesn’t pay the bills.
 Right. And I’m kind of curious, you know, Gary Bernhard, I interviewed him over a
 SCNA and he’s talked about how doing the destroy all software, he has people just sending him
 requests and, and, and saying, you know, can you look at this code, can analyze it?
 And they kind of an expectation that he can do all that.
 Do you get that with the pair program?
 Do you ever get people saying, hey, why don’t you have time for, for my project?
 Or has it been pretty like congenial?
 What has your been your experience?
 No, it’s, it’s, it’s, it’s been extremely genial.
 I, I, anybody who follows me on Twitter.
 Well, first of all, knows that I tweet way too much, but also knows that like somewhere between
 like, you know, like once a week or to once a month, I tweet the same line over and over again.
 I get the nicest emails.
 Yes.
 And, and it’s because I do and I keep tweeting that because it keeps happening.
 You know, I honestly, the, the Ruby community is fantastic.
 And, and I don’t know what it is, but, but I get, you know, for what I get is, is just the
 nicest things that people, people say.
 And, and I don’t really, I occasionally, I’ve had people, I’ve had, you know, I, I get a
 lot of requests for, can you give me some advice?
 Now I’d say more often, it’s more like career advice than it is like, can you fix this code?
 Okay.
 But, you know, I try to get back to everyone, you know, sometimes I’ll say, look, I, I’m sorry.
 I, I tried to look at this, but I just didn’t have time to really dig into it.
 Right.
 But for, but I, I know, I, I wouldn’t say I get a ton of people being like,
 can you, you know, please fix my code now.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 That was a, that was one thing I had to wonder is like, how much is a signal to noise?
 Do you get on these requests for, you know, where somebody like, you remember, I don’t
 know if you ever looked at old code project or anything like that.
 Some of the older code sites where people would go in and basically post, um, or no, it
 was, uh, the guru, um, sites for, can you do my homework for me?
 Kind of requests.
 Um, I just wondered if you got those kinds of things, um, but, uh, um, the, the, the
 weird.
 Every now and then I get like somebody, the, the, the most common, the most common sort
 of like missing request that kind of misses the target is, is I’ll get a request that
 says for an open source pairing session that says, I, I want some tutoring, you know, I,
 I like, I want to pass this test and I’d like some tutoring and I have to say, look, the,
 the open source pairing sessions are really for putting code back into the community.
 Right.
 Uh, so like if you have a project that you own or that you want to.
 Uh, you know, commit, commit to not commit to, but, you know, make some submissions to,
 uh, that’s open source, you know, that’s, that’s really what that’s for.
 It’s not really about me teaching.
 Yeah.
 So it’s not, uh, really code 101.
 It’s more of, you kind of have to have some, at least basic, uh, experience with programming
 and be almost there.
 It just may be a little bit of guidance or, or something that you need.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I do a lot of tutoring, a lot of training and tutoring.
 But that’s pretty much under the, the content in the context of paid sessions.
 Okay.
 Uh, because, you know, it’s, it’s, I mean, it’s tiring and it’s, it takes, um, it takes
 a lot out, out of someone to, you know, to do that kind of, that kind of work.
 And I, I kind of look to the open source sessions to be a bit more relaxing, um, a bit more,
 you know, a bit more fun because, Hey, it’s, you know, it’s working open source code and
 that’s, that’s awesome.
 And so going over to, uh, uh, some of the,
 the more public stuff that you do, that’s the, the Ruby, uh, uh, rogues.
 That’s, uh, a pretty popular podcast.
 I seen, um, uh, Jim gray is, is trying to really get it elected to the, to the best
 podcast of the year.
 He’s been tweeting about that a lot, but it’s always a pretty enjoyable interview.
 And, um, I, matter of fact, I listened to your, uh, most recent interview, at least
 the first part of it where, uh, you guys have this kind of, um, um, banter.
 Uh, and, uh, there was something about jokes that can’t be made.
 Uh, Jim, uh, Jim gray, I believe, uh, said something about, we can’t say these certain
 types of jokes.
 And, and then immediately somebody made a joke about, um, back at Jim about, you know,
 the wheelchair or something like that.
 I was about standing desks and it was, you know, only friends can do that kind of thing.
 Yes.
 And, uh, and, and that’s really what it sounds like on that podcast, you know, um, how, how
 did you guys come to start that cast?
 And, uh, well, let me, let me be clear here.
 I, I, I’m a late comer to that podcast.
 I’m, I’m the most recent addition to that, to that group.
 Okay.
 Um, and so as far as I know, so it’s, it’s Chuck’s podcast, you know, he, he put it together
 initially and, um, I actually don’t know the details of the early history.
 I can’t remember who exactly was there at the beginning.
 I know, I’m pretty sure it was, it was Chuck and, um, and James.
 Um, and I’m not sure who else, um, at the beginning, I’d have to go back and look at
 some of the early episodes to see.
 And I know that they, you know, they added some, some folks along the way and then, and
 for a while there, um, before I came on, um, uh, Aaron Patterson was a regular.
 Okay.
 And, uh, you know, which is awesome, but, um, I, I came on for an episode, um, and then
 they, you know, I, I did.
 I didn’t, I, I, I guess I didn’t insult them enough and, and, and they, they had me back,
 um, for another episode.
 And at some point, um, Aaron said, decided that he just didn’t have time to devote to
 that podcast every week.
 And at that point they, I, I basically took Aaron’s slot, which, which, uh, is kind of
 a big seat to fill.
 Yeah.
 It is tender love.
 So, um, well then I’d like to just jump straight over to the distributed.
 Team or the Y team, excuse me.
 So, uh, apparently you, or I should say not apparently, but it really seems that you do
 have a passion for remote, uh, uh, uh, collaboration.
 Yeah.
 And, um, I have not yet listened to the Y teams.
 I saw it and it was kind of the day I, that I, I decided I had to contact you to talk
 because I was, I was working on you fantastic and I was not feeling good about something.
 And I saw it.
 I saw another Ruby tapas had come out and then I’m like, Hmm, uh, wow.
 Yeah.
 He’s got Ruby tapas and, uh, and Ruby rogues.
 And then there was something, you tweeted something about Y teams.
 I was like, and then I went and looked at your bio.
 I’m like, this guy is like a, uh, between them and the books.
 I didn’t even mention the books.
 Um, what have you learned through the, uh, the, the Y teams and what kind of was your
 inspiration for doing that?
 Well, the inspiration is just, you know, uh, I work remotely and I probably always.
 Will, because I want to live where I want to live with my family and, and, and I don’t,
 you know, so, you know, my, I, a few years ago I thought to myself, you know, what is
 the best way to, to, you know, I felt like, you know, if, if I’m going to make a career
 out of working remotely with other software developers, it behooves me to become good
 at it.
 And I figured the best way to do that would be to talk to a lot of other people who are
 doing it and, you know, pick their brains.
 And, you know, and I also just felt like, you know, when I was looking around back then,
 I, I thought, you know, that didn’t seem like there were a lot of good resources out there
 for, you know, there were a lot of people doing it.
 There are a lot of people doing different kinds of, of remote work arrangements, whether
 fully distributed or just like, you know, there’s, you know, a main team and then there’s
 some satellite people or whatever.
 A lot of these things were going on, but there weren’t any resources where they were getting
 together and talking to each other.
 And so wide teams has always been, you know, the
 dream for that has always been to build a community around the practice of, of dispersed
 teams and remote work.
 So if somebody was going to sit down and grab and listen to one episode, is there any one
 particular interview that you got a lot of wisdom from or?
 I think I would have to get back to you on that one.
 That’s a, that’s a really tough one to answer.
 You know, I know a lot of people really enjoyed the Chad Fowler.
 Interview.
 But, you know, truth be told, there have been so many good ones.
 It’s, it’s, it’s hard to narrow it down.
 Here’s the question then.
 Is it one of the things sitting down with user group people and people involved in technical
 communities, I’ve seen certain patterns that have emerged in the way different people approach
 the community community.
 Have you seen that with the wide teams?
 It’s like been like, oh, I’ve talked to these 20, 30, 50 people and some patterns have emerged.
 Is that.
 And something you’ve seen.
 I think a lot of people are, are in fairly similar situations.
 I mean, you have a lot of startups that, that, you know, they have, they have people in them
 that wanted to work together, you know, maybe they had all worked together at a previous
 company, but then they went their separate ways and, you know, different parts of the
 country or the world, you know, but they still wanted to work together.
 You’ve got some groups like that.
 You have more established companies that are just realizing that they don’t have enough
 local talent to fill the slots.
 You know, that they want to, you know, to, to do the work they want to get done.
 And so they’re trying to hire people from wherever the talent is rather than, than just in their
 local area.
 And, you know, and, and various things in between there.
 But I mean, those are some of the trends that I see.
 Okay.
 And, and just kind of to come to an, well, I actually have two more questions.
 One is, I’ll just go with the equipment first.
 Because I’m.
 I’m curious as well.
 And I’m sure other people who are going to be working remotely, I’m curious for different
 reasons.
 I’m just interested about the setup you use for recording, and I’m sure you use some of
 this for your remoting work as well.
 What kind of microphone and stand and setup do you use for, for.
 So for recording, what I’m talking to right now is my, my blue snowball, which is the
 kind of the, I think it’s probably one of the most recommended, you know, podcast recording
 mics out there for, if you don’t want to spend an arm and a leg, you know, it’s, it’s USB,
 which is wonderful because you don’t have to worry about like, like interference on the
 analog cables.
 And so that’s that my stand is just some cheap stand that I had lying around in my, in my
 attic, you know, and I’ve got, I’ve got a pop filter that I got along with them like,
 and let’s see what else.
 As far as like remote pairing stuff.
 What do you want to just know about like audio equipment or equipment in general?
 Just what do you use for communications?
 Do you, do you have a camera open regularly or do you, I try to have video going and here’s
 what I do.
 Let me, I’m going to try to rotate this and hopefully this won’t come tumbling down.
 If you look over to my right over here.
 Well, one thing you see is a mess, but let’s see.
 If we can get this far enough over, let’s see, you can just sort of see the corner.
 There it is.
 The corner of my tablet, which is mounted on a mount, which holds it up in the air.
 Okay, to my right.
 And what I try to do, I try to use my tablet as my primary comms device and it’s, you know,
 so I’ve got Skype and, and, and Google+.
 And, and, uh, Google talk on it.
 And so I’ll try to have the person that I’m working with on my, like over here, uh, on
 the tablet and I can look over to them and there’s their, their face on video.
 Assuming we’ve got a decent enough connection.
 Um, you know, I spring for, for business broadband, but not everyone has, has a good connection
 and, and sometimes the internet has bad days.
 But, but, um, you know, I have them over here and then I usually have the screen share that
 we’re working on.
 In front of me on my computer.
 So it’s a little bit more natural than like the, the, the, like staring back at each other
 kind of set up where you’re both, um, you know, where you’re using the camera on your
 work laptop thing.
 Uh, and I, I kind of like that.
 It also takes some of the, the hardware load off of the PC that I’m working on.
 Yeah.
 And then you don’t have to worry about a reboot or anything like that.
 Right.
 For, um, for that I’ve been lately, I’ve been using a, um, a
 VXI, uh, uh, blue parrot, uh, B two 50 XT plus, uh, which is a headset.
 It’s a Bluetooth headset that is mainly designed as I understand it for truckers.
 Um, it’s got ridiculously long battery life.
 It’s got like 20 hours of, of talk time and a, uh, and it’s got a fairly aggressive, um, noise
 control, you know, for, for surround, like not picking up on surrounding noises.
 Yeah, that would, that would be kind of necessary.
 In a truck.
 They’re pretty loud.
 Yeah, but you know, it’s nice for me because like a lot of the Bluetooth headsets out there
 are, they’re, they’re mainly, they’re oriented towards people making occasional calls.
 They’re not oriented towards somebody sitting for, you know, two, four, six, eight hours
 at a time and working with somebody else.
 And, uh, and so that’s why I got that and that’s been working out pretty well.
 And kind of where I’m going to end, uh, the final question is working from home, working
 remotely, uh, you’re disconnected a little bit from, um, the banter.
 The, the chat in, in a normal office, you’re more of a person who’s on the edge of technology.
 You don’t really, I should say, you know, Ruby and, and the, and the tools you’re using,
 uh, might not necessarily have to depend on, uh, user groups or anything like that for
 seeing a, a breast of what’s going on.
 But do you ever go to user groups or?
 Oh yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um, so my sort of, you know, home user group is, I would say is the Baltimore be more on
 rails group, which I’ve been going there.
 Since their very first meeting, I believe.
 Um, and, uh, there’s also a group up in Harrisburg.
 Um, and I try to, I try to get, get to both of those occasionally.
 I certainly don’t get every week, get down there every month, but, uh, occasionally I
 try to get to those.
 I have a lot of friends at both and, uh, yeah, I, I love users groups and I, uh, you know,
 it’s people, like I said, a lot of people write to me asking about like career advice
 for a young programmer and that’s usually one of the very first things that I stress is
 get yourself involved in a local users group.
 Right.
 And I would appreciate it if you put us in touch with them because I, I would love to
 interview them as well.
 The people who run those groups and, um, and the last but most important question is, do
 you have a filter for your voice or is that your own natural Barrett?
 I don’t, I don’t have anything going on here.
 I mean, it’s just the mic.
 Okay.
 Cause I was going to say whatever it is and however much it is, I’m going to buy it because
 I need that radio voice.
 Um, I mean, maybe, maybe I have, maybe this basement just happens to have good acoustics.
 I don’t know.
 Well, okay.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me.
 I really appreciate it.
 Sure.
 Thanks.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 There’s the mark.
 All right.
 Well, yeah, that was perfect.</p>

    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic, and I'm at RailsConf 2014, and\n I'm standing here with Aaron Patterson.\n You might know him as TenderLove on Twitter and GitHub and\n all those social places, but\n he's going to be giving the footnote to the conference\n tonight.\n He can't really call it the keynote, because it's at the\n end.\n I don't know what to call it.\n The anti-keynote.\n Yeah, the anti-keynote.\n Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with\n me.\n Can you tell me a little bit about what your talk is going\n to be about?\n Yeah, well, first, I guess the first 30% is just going to\n be jokes and trolling.\n The second 30% is going to be, I don't know, some bugs and\n stuff with active record internals,\n and the first 30% is going to be, I don't know, some bugs\n and stuff with active record internals,\n and the first 30% is going to be, I don't know, some bugs\n and stuff with active record internals,\n and the first 30% is going to be, I don't know, some bugs\n and stuff with active record internals,\n and the first 30% is going to be, I don't know, some bugs\n and stuff with active record internals,\n and the final 60% is going to be, excuse me, the final 50%\n is going to be about adequate record,\n and I know that adds up to 110%, but I always like to give\n 110%.\n It's 100%. Just don't add it. Don't add.\n So, yeah, it's just going to be, like, I don't know, jokes,\n bugs, and then adequate record is what we're going to be\n talking about.\n Okay. What is adequate record?\n It's a project.\n It's a project that I've been working on.\n I've been working on it for a very long time, but I didn't\n really have a name for it,\n but what it is is it's just a set of patches on top of\n active record.\n Okay.\n It's just stuff that I've been doing on top of active\n record,\n specifically for performance, like performance improvements\n to active record.\n Is it, like, just more of a streamlining of the internals,\n or?\n Well, it's been, so basically I've been refactoring the\n internals for a very long,\n like, I've had this idea for the performance improvements,\n and what the main performance improvement is is basically\n SQL statement generation caching.\n So, actually, the string that you pass to the database, or\n that active record passes to the database,\n like the actual SQL statement, it caches the generation of\n that.\n So, we only do that once, and your queries end up being\n faster from that.\n But I've been working on, basically, internal refactoring\n for literally years\n just to get to the point where I could do, I could have\n this particular thing,\n but I never had a name for it until recently.\n Oh, really?\n Yeah, well, that sounds like what in other database engines\n where you can lean on some of that query caching inside of\n it.\n You're pulling some of that capability out into the Ruby\n layer, the app layer, so it can...\n Yeah, yeah, we actually already do, so active record\n actually already does query caching,\n like uses prepared statements and does cache query\n execution.\n So, we do that.\n The problem, though,\n is that even though we use those prepared statements,\n we still have to generate the SQL statement in order to\n look up the prepared statement and then do that.\n So, we've always had this overhead before querying the\n database of building up the query before we go out.\n So, this basically eliminates that overhead as part of the\n stuff I've been working on.\n Yeah, and you've been a contributor to Rails for a while.\n Yeah.\n Is Rails the first open source projects you were involved\n in,\n or how did you come to being a Rails core?\n Yeah, no, no, not at all.\n Rails was not the first thing I worked on at all.\n I guess I've been working on, well, my very first open\n source commit,\n or open source patch was probably in, what was that, 2001,\n I think.\n It was to a Perl library.\n Don't Google me.\n Perl, please.\n It's embarrassing.\n But.\n You don't want anybody to know you did Perl.\n No, no.\n I can't.\n No, my first real major open source stuff was with Ruby in\n maybe 2006, working on the Mechanize gem.\n That was my first real meet.\n Also, that was a port of the Perl Mechanize.\n Perl Mechanize, yeah, yeah.\n By Andy Lester, who I've also interviewed.\n Ah, awesome.\n He's also from my neck of the woods.\n Oh, that's awesome.\n Yeah, yeah.\n So, from one open source project to another, I'm making the\n network.\n I'm going to close all the open source contributors.\n Yeah, yeah.\n So, I worked on, actually, I mean, I didn't actually start\n Mechanize.\n I inherited it from somebody.\n Like, I was using it a lot, and, like, actually, I have a\n fun story about using it.\n But, anyway, yeah, like, the current, or the maintainer,\n when I picked it up, he wasn't,\n he wasn't working on it so much, so I picked it up from him\n, and that was, like, my first\n responsibility, I guess.\n So, that's when you became a grown-up in FOSS.\n Yes, yes, exactly.\n Is that when you decided to go with the beard, or?\n No.\n You're like, oh, I own something.\n I got a responsibility.\n Yeah, I probably got to grow up, just grow out the beard.\n But, you know, but from there, when did you learn about\n Rails?\n So, basically.\n So, basically, around the same time, I was getting into\n Ruby, working on, like, basically\n working on Mechanize, just to do some, oh, automation, like\n, web automation stuff.\n And then, around that same time, the 15-minute video came\n out.\n Oh, yeah, that, that, build a blog post.\n Yeah, and then I saw, so I saw that.\n Build a blog.\n Yeah, I saw that, and I was like, wow, I got to try this\n out.\n So, I tried out, like, I tried out.\n I tried out Rails from there, and I loved it.\n I was actually a, I was actually a Java developer at the\n time.\n Like, I worked at a, worked on J2EE systems, and saw the,\n saw the blog in 15 minutes, and\n I was like, I must do this.\n This looks so much easier than my job.\n Yeah, and more fun.\n Yes, definitely.\n So, that's how I got introduced, like, how I was introduced\n to Rails.\n And then, I don't know, maybe about a year later, I got a\n job.\n I.\n Took a job doing Rails development for a startup.\n And then, and then you just started contributing patches,\n or?\n Yeah, yeah.\n I mean, I did a lot, like, basically, throughout that time,\n my open source portfolio was growing, I suppose.\n And, so, at this startup, I got experience doing Rails\n development.\n Like, I didn't really contribute any patches or anything.\n I was just an app developer, right?\n But, after that job, I got a job at.\n It was AT&T, and I was doing app development there as well,\n but it turns out that, like.\n Oh, AT&T Interactive?\n Yeah.\n The Seattle Ruby thing?\n Yep, AT&T Interactive.\n Yeah, I got a job there, and they, it turns out they had a\n lot of Ruby developers, and\n a lot of them were using my open source stuff.\n And they also needed patches to Rails, and I guess, like,\n one thing led to another, and\n that's, like, that's basically how I got involved.\n Yeah, I have to say, was it kind of a little trippy to meet\n people?\n Like, were you using my stuff?\n Oh, yes.\n Yes.\n Absolutely.\n It was very, like.\n So, at the time, I had, I mean, you know, I knew there were\n people out there who used\n my software, but I was.\n It was kind of an abstract thing.\n Well, I was, yes, it was kind of abstract.\n I was also completely oblivious to the actual number of\n people who were really using it,\n because, I mean, you know, you only get, like, you get a\n bug report or whatever, you only\n get one.\n I mean, you get a bug report from a very small percentage\n of people who actually use your\n software, and, like, you don't understand exactly how small\n a percentage that is, right?\n So, then when you understand, like, oh, it's actually a\n very tiny percentage, which means\n that there are tons of people using your software, it kind\n of, it blows your mind.\n It's pretty incredible.\n So, yeah, it was very nice.\n Yeah.\n Well, and now here you're speaking to a conference for,\n probably,\n the vast overwhelming majority.\n I mean, I don't know if I said exactly this to DHH, but,\n you know, I pay my bills using\n these tools.\n And, you know, and that's, I often wonder for people who\n are running large projects\n or contributing to these, does that ever alter your\n perception of the relationship with,\n like, don't you just try not to think about that too much?\n No, I mean, I think about that.\n It actually, like, that actually makes me very happy that\n people are using my software\n to pay, you know, pay bills.\n I mean, like, I don't know, like, I like...\n I got all serious on you, man.\n I'm sorry.\n No, no, no, it's okay.\n It's okay.\n It's okay.\n Like, it's actually, so it's actually really cool to me\n because I want to be able to help\n people, right?\n Like, ideally, I would, I want to help people.\n I want to help as many people as possible, and, like, my\n skills are programming.\n Like, that is what I do, and that's something I can do well\n, and I feel like I have more\n reach to help people.\n Like, doing, by doing open source stuff, I feel like I'm\n actually improving the lives\n of more people than, say, if I was working on an online\n advertising website.\n Yeah.\n Or coupons.\n Which is where, yes, exactly, or where, so, like, that's, I\n mean, that's why I love doing\n what I do, and I'm happy to think about that.\n Makes me happy that people are making money with software,\n right?\n Yeah.\n So, so it feels good, and it's fun.\n And that, and that's overall the vibe you give on, on your\n Twitter and everything is\n you do the Friday Hugs, you have your cat, Gorby Puff?\n Yes, Gorby Puff, yes.\n Yeah, I can't remember if it's Gorby Puff or just Gorby.\n Well, well, his full name is Gorbachev Puff Puff Thunder\n Horse, the third, but we call\n him Gorby Puff for short.\n Gorbachev, Gorbachev Puff Puff Thunder Horse.\n Thunder Horse, the third.\n The third, yes.\n Yeah, so you hear it here.\n Please, please get it right on, on the Twitter.\n Yeah, I like, so I was thinking about.\n You don't know him well enough to call him Gorby Puff.\n I was thinking about changing my name to Thunder Horse,\n because it sounds like, it sounds super\n awesome.\n When, when I got married, I was like, hey, what do you\n think about changing our last\n name to Thunder Horse?\n Then we can be in a band or something.\n We'll be, yeah, we'll be the band.\n You do, you do have the metal vibe.\n No, I feel like, you know, I'm going to get a contact high.\n No, I'm kidding.\n I'm kidding.\n I feel like I should be getting a contact high.\n I'm not actually.\n Erase, erase.\n No, I'm not going to erase that.\n But, well, and with that relationship to the community, and\n sometimes I think, I was\n thinking, looking at the conference, and I look at DHH's\n very early talk, which is funny\n in his wry sense of, his wry humor, his very Danish,\n Denmarkian humor.\n And then.\n A little bit more, uh, uh, American humor, a little bit\n more obvious.\n Uh, and I, and I was thinking like, what is the analogy?\n I was thinking Bing Crosby and Bob Holt.\n They were both funny, but one was more, you know, the guff\naw funny and, uh.\n Hey-o.\n Yeah.\n Swing the golf club, you know, and, uh, one was more funny,\n but in a very upright way.\n Uh, so I just think it's, it's funny.\n In our community that we have, uh, we have our own Bing C\nrosby and, and Bob Holt.\n And, you know, I, I think though, when, when DHH got up and\n, and, and gave his, his talk\n that because he didn't have the Bob Holt to, to foil off of\n, I think some people took what\n he said a little too literally, a little too much to heart.\n Oh, yeah.\n Am I, am I.\n No, I agree.\n I agree with you.\n I agree with you.\n Well.\n But, but I think it's fine because, um, that's basically\n why I'm going to be trolling him\n in my talk.\n Yeah.\n So when they, when they listen to you, they should think of\n it in the context of, you\n know, these are people who are central to the maintenance\n and future of rails and kind\n of orbiting around each other in, in getting in the\n direction that you listen.\n I am the, we're the yin and yang.\n Yeah.\n I suppose.\n One's going to have the little captain.\n Captain's cap, uh, and a golf club, but I'm sure, uh, I'm\n sure DHH knows how to dance really\n well.\n Oh yeah.\n Yeah.\n Um, well, thank you very much for taking the time.\n Oh, thank you so much.\n I appreciate it.\n Thank you.\n It was good to meet you here.\n Have a hug.\n I'll get it on a Friday.\n Thanks.\n User groups with lots to say interviews and more.\n No way.\n Sharing great ideas in the tech community.\n Fascinating conversations, a plethora of information.\n Find out for yourself today at ugtastic.com.\n Thank you.",

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic, and I’m at RailsConf 2014, and
 I’m standing here with Aaron Patterson.
 You might know him as TenderLove on Twitter and GitHub and
 all those social places, but
 he’s going to be giving the footnote to the conference
 tonight.
 He can’t really call it the keynote, because it’s at the
 end.
 I don’t know what to call it.
 The anti-keynote.
 Yeah, the anti-keynote.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 Can you tell me a little bit about what your talk is going
 to be about?
 Yeah, well, first, I guess the first 30% is just going to
 be jokes and trolling.
 The second 30% is going to be, I don’t know, some bugs and
 stuff with active record internals,
 and the first 30% is going to be, I don’t know, some bugs
 and stuff with active record internals,
 and the first 30% is going to be, I don’t know, some bugs
 and stuff with active record internals,
 and the first 30% is going to be, I don’t know, some bugs
 and stuff with active record internals,
 and the first 30% is going to be, I don’t know, some bugs
 and stuff with active record internals,
 and the final 60% is going to be, excuse me, the final 50%
 is going to be about adequate record,
 and I know that adds up to 110%, but I always like to give
 110%.
 It’s 100%. Just don’t add it. Don’t add.
 So, yeah, it’s just going to be, like, I don’t know, jokes,
 bugs, and then adequate record is what we’re going to be
 talking about.
 Okay. What is adequate record?
 It’s a project.
 It’s a project that I’ve been working on.
 I’ve been working on it for a very long time, but I didn’t
 really have a name for it,
 but what it is is it’s just a set of patches on top of
 active record.
 Okay.
 It’s just stuff that I’ve been doing on top of active
 record,
 specifically for performance, like performance improvements
 to active record.
 Is it, like, just more of a streamlining of the internals,
 or?
 Well, it’s been, so basically I’ve been refactoring the
 internals for a very long,
 like, I’ve had this idea for the performance improvements,
 and what the main performance improvement is is basically
 SQL statement generation caching.
 So, actually, the string that you pass to the database, or
 that active record passes to the database,
 like the actual SQL statement, it caches the generation of
 that.
 So, we only do that once, and your queries end up being
 faster from that.
 But I’ve been working on, basically, internal refactoring
 for literally years
 just to get to the point where I could do, I could have
 this particular thing,
 but I never had a name for it until recently.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah, well, that sounds like what in other database engines
 where you can lean on some of that query caching inside of
 it.
 You’re pulling some of that capability out into the Ruby
 layer, the app layer, so it can…
 Yeah, yeah, we actually already do, so active record
 actually already does query caching,
 like uses prepared statements and does cache query
 execution.
 So, we do that.
 The problem, though,
 is that even though we use those prepared statements,
 we still have to generate the SQL statement in order to
 look up the prepared statement and then do that.
 So, we’ve always had this overhead before querying the
 database of building up the query before we go out.
 So, this basically eliminates that overhead as part of the
 stuff I’ve been working on.
 Yeah, and you’ve been a contributor to Rails for a while.
 Yeah.
 Is Rails the first open source projects you were involved
 in,
 or how did you come to being a Rails core?
 Yeah, no, no, not at all.
 Rails was not the first thing I worked on at all.
 I guess I’ve been working on, well, my very first open
 source commit,
 or open source patch was probably in, what was that, 2001,
 I think.
 It was to a Perl library.
 Don’t Google me.
 Perl, please.
 It’s embarrassing.
 But.
 You don’t want anybody to know you did Perl.
 No, no.
 I can’t.
 No, my first real major open source stuff was with Ruby in
 maybe 2006, working on the Mechanize gem.
 That was my first real meet.
 Also, that was a port of the Perl Mechanize.
 Perl Mechanize, yeah, yeah.
 By Andy Lester, who I’ve also interviewed.
 Ah, awesome.
 He’s also from my neck of the woods.
 Oh, that’s awesome.
 Yeah, yeah.
 So, from one open source project to another, I’m making the
 network.
 I’m going to close all the open source contributors.
 Yeah, yeah.
 So, I worked on, actually, I mean, I didn’t actually start
 Mechanize.
 I inherited it from somebody.
 Like, I was using it a lot, and, like, actually, I have a
 fun story about using it.
 But, anyway, yeah, like, the current, or the maintainer,
 when I picked it up, he wasn’t,
 he wasn’t working on it so much, so I picked it up from him
, and that was, like, my first
 responsibility, I guess.
 So, that’s when you became a grown-up in FOSS.
 Yes, yes, exactly.
 Is that when you decided to go with the beard, or?
 No.
 You’re like, oh, I own something.
 I got a responsibility.
 Yeah, I probably got to grow up, just grow out the beard.
 But, you know, but from there, when did you learn about
 Rails?
 So, basically.
 So, basically, around the same time, I was getting into
 Ruby, working on, like, basically
 working on Mechanize, just to do some, oh, automation, like
, web automation stuff.
 And then, around that same time, the 15-minute video came
 out.
 Oh, yeah, that, that, build a blog post.
 Yeah, and then I saw, so I saw that.
 Build a blog.
 Yeah, I saw that, and I was like, wow, I got to try this
 out.
 So, I tried out, like, I tried out.
 I tried out Rails from there, and I loved it.
 I was actually a, I was actually a Java developer at the
 time.
 Like, I worked at a, worked on J2EE systems, and saw the,
 saw the blog in 15 minutes, and
 I was like, I must do this.
 This looks so much easier than my job.
 Yeah, and more fun.
 Yes, definitely.
 So, that’s how I got introduced, like, how I was introduced
 to Rails.
 And then, I don’t know, maybe about a year later, I got a
 job.
 I.
 Took a job doing Rails development for a startup.
 And then, and then you just started contributing patches,
 or?
 Yeah, yeah.
 I mean, I did a lot, like, basically, throughout that time,
 my open source portfolio was growing, I suppose.
 And, so, at this startup, I got experience doing Rails
 development.
 Like, I didn’t really contribute any patches or anything.
 I was just an app developer, right?
 But, after that job, I got a job at.
 It was AT&amp;T, and I was doing app development there as well,
 but it turns out that, like.
 Oh, AT&amp;T Interactive?
 Yeah.
 The Seattle Ruby thing?
 Yep, AT&amp;T Interactive.
 Yeah, I got a job there, and they, it turns out they had a
 lot of Ruby developers, and
 a lot of them were using my open source stuff.
 And they also needed patches to Rails, and I guess, like,
 one thing led to another, and
 that’s, like, that’s basically how I got involved.
 Yeah, I have to say, was it kind of a little trippy to meet
 people?
 Like, were you using my stuff?
 Oh, yes.
 Yes.
 Absolutely.
 It was very, like.
 So, at the time, I had, I mean, you know, I knew there were
 people out there who used
 my software, but I was.
 It was kind of an abstract thing.
 Well, I was, yes, it was kind of abstract.
 I was also completely oblivious to the actual number of
 people who were really using it,
 because, I mean, you know, you only get, like, you get a
 bug report or whatever, you only
 get one.
 I mean, you get a bug report from a very small percentage
 of people who actually use your
 software, and, like, you don’t understand exactly how small
 a percentage that is, right?
 So, then when you understand, like, oh, it’s actually a
 very tiny percentage, which means
 that there are tons of people using your software, it kind
 of, it blows your mind.
 It’s pretty incredible.
 So, yeah, it was very nice.
 Yeah.
 Well, and now here you’re speaking to a conference for,
 probably,
 the vast overwhelming majority.
 I mean, I don’t know if I said exactly this to DHH, but,
 you know, I pay my bills using
 these tools.
 And, you know, and that’s, I often wonder for people who
 are running large projects
 or contributing to these, does that ever alter your
 perception of the relationship with,
 like, don’t you just try not to think about that too much?
 No, I mean, I think about that.
 It actually, like, that actually makes me very happy that
 people are using my software
 to pay, you know, pay bills.
 I mean, like, I don’t know, like, I like…
 I got all serious on you, man.
 I’m sorry.
 No, no, no, it’s okay.
 It’s okay.
 It’s okay.
 Like, it’s actually, so it’s actually really cool to me
 because I want to be able to help
 people, right?
 Like, ideally, I would, I want to help people.
 I want to help as many people as possible, and, like, my
 skills are programming.
 Like, that is what I do, and that’s something I can do well
, and I feel like I have more
 reach to help people.
 Like, doing, by doing open source stuff, I feel like I’m
 actually improving the lives
 of more people than, say, if I was working on an online
 advertising website.
 Yeah.
 Or coupons.
 Which is where, yes, exactly, or where, so, like, that’s, I
 mean, that’s why I love doing
 what I do, and I’m happy to think about that.
 Makes me happy that people are making money with software,
 right?
 Yeah.
 So, so it feels good, and it’s fun.
 And that, and that’s overall the vibe you give on, on your
 Twitter and everything is
 you do the Friday Hugs, you have your cat, Gorby Puff?
 Yes, Gorby Puff, yes.
 Yeah, I can’t remember if it’s Gorby Puff or just Gorby.
 Well, well, his full name is Gorbachev Puff Puff Thunder
 Horse, the third, but we call
 him Gorby Puff for short.
 Gorbachev, Gorbachev Puff Puff Thunder Horse.
 Thunder Horse, the third.
 The third, yes.
 Yeah, so you hear it here.
 Please, please get it right on, on the Twitter.
 Yeah, I like, so I was thinking about.
 You don’t know him well enough to call him Gorby Puff.
 I was thinking about changing my name to Thunder Horse,
 because it sounds like, it sounds super
 awesome.
 When, when I got married, I was like, hey, what do you
 think about changing our last
 name to Thunder Horse?
 Then we can be in a band or something.
 We’ll be, yeah, we’ll be the band.
 You do, you do have the metal vibe.
 No, I feel like, you know, I’m going to get a contact high.
 No, I’m kidding.
 I’m kidding.
 I feel like I should be getting a contact high.
 I’m not actually.
 Erase, erase.
 No, I’m not going to erase that.
 But, well, and with that relationship to the community, and
 sometimes I think, I was
 thinking, looking at the conference, and I look at DHH’s
 very early talk, which is funny
 in his wry sense of, his wry humor, his very Danish,
 Denmarkian humor.
 And then.
 A little bit more, uh, uh, American humor, a little bit
 more obvious.
 Uh, and I, and I was thinking like, what is the analogy?
 I was thinking Bing Crosby and Bob Holt.
 They were both funny, but one was more, you know, the guff
aw funny and, uh.
 Hey-o.
 Yeah.
 Swing the golf club, you know, and, uh, one was more funny,
 but in a very upright way.
 Uh, so I just think it’s, it’s funny.
 In our community that we have, uh, we have our own Bing C
rosby and, and Bob Holt.
 And, you know, I, I think though, when, when DHH got up and
, and, and gave his, his talk
 that because he didn’t have the Bob Holt to, to foil off of
, I think some people took what
 he said a little too literally, a little too much to heart.
 Oh, yeah.
 Am I, am I.
 No, I agree.
 I agree with you.
 I agree with you.
 Well.
 But, but I think it’s fine because, um, that’s basically
 why I’m going to be trolling him
 in my talk.
 Yeah.
 So when they, when they listen to you, they should think of
 it in the context of, you
 know, these are people who are central to the maintenance
 and future of rails and kind
 of orbiting around each other in, in getting in the
 direction that you listen.
 I am the, we’re the yin and yang.
 Yeah.
 I suppose.
 One’s going to have the little captain.
 Captain’s cap, uh, and a golf club, but I’m sure, uh, I’m
 sure DHH knows how to dance really
 well.
 Oh yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um, well, thank you very much for taking the time.
 Oh, thank you so much.
 I appreciate it.
 Thank you.
 It was good to meet you here.
 Have a hug.
 I’ll get it on a Friday.

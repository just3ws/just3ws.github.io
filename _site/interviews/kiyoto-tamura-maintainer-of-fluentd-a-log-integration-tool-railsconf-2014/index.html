    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at RailsConf 2014 and\n I'm sitting here with\n Kiyoto Tamura, who is a maintainer for the Fluentd log\n aggregation and data\n collector. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak\n. What is a log\n aggregator/collector? Fluentd is a log aggregator/log\n collector written\n in Ruby and its key features are that it's really\n lightweight, it's a very small\n Ruby program augmented by extensible plugin architecture\n and it runs\n pretty fast for all sorts of logs. A lot of our customers\n collect data for\n like Apache Engine logs, Apache Nginx logs, syslogs,\n application logs and\n store them in like Elasticsearch, store them in MongoDB,\n copy the data, archive it,\n and so forth. We started a project two and a half years ago\n and the community has grown\n to be about like 50 regular contributors, thousands of\n users in the world including\n Slideshare and Nintendo. Yeah, Nintendo, that's actually,\n that's\n pretty cool. I mean, are you able to say how they're using\n it?\n I'm actually not sure about the actual like, you know, how\n they use it, but I think\n it's part of their like online games that are going on now.\n Okay. And basically like with all these companies, logs are\n very, very important.\n They want to centrally manage it and they want to do all\n sorts of operations\n on them. And before, like a lot of, like myself included,\n we would rsync, write a\n script here and there, but as like the number of your data\n sources increase and\n the number of storage systems you want to store and use\n increase, the complexity\n increases like exponentially. And we wanted 10 complexity,\n keep everything\n simple, and keep everything performantly.\n So how did you get involved in this project?\n Yeah, so I'm the, so the Fluentd was originally created by\n my employer, Treasure\n Data. And I'm employee number one. And when we first\n created the thing, we didn't think\n it was going to be big, but one of our customers saw it and\n they were like, man, like we wish\n this was open source. And we sort of drew the inspiration\n from Heroku, who actually\n offers service as a pass.\n Okay.\n But they also like open source a lot of stuff. That's\n really cool.\n Especially the stuff that runs on the client side. So we\n did the same. The community\n started to grow organically. Right now we have like a\n little short of like 1800 stars\n on GitHub and it's been steadily rising.\n Oh, wow. That's, so it's, it's a pretty well adopted.\n Yeah. I used to, I sometimes do the self-deprecating so\n that it is the law\n collector that nobody's heard of.\n Right.\n But it's actually pretty cool.\n Yeah. No, 1800 people have heard it at least.\n Yeah.\n Click that button.\n Yeah.\n So the, the contributions is are, do you, it's open source,\n but how do you, how do you\n interact with the community? Do you have people like\n contributing patches or doing?\n Yeah, yeah, yeah. So right now I think there are 18 people\n with commit rights. Three of\n them come from us, Treasure Data. It's a fairly, it's a\n very balanced community in the sense\n that we have commuters from like various companies. And\n although we started originally in Japan,\n we're, Treasure Data's founders are originally from Japan,\n starting to spread like a lot\n of the questions these days come from like all parts of the\n world. And as someone who\n constantly asks this question to the mailing list, I'm, I'm\n glad to see this adoption going\n global.\n And you know, it's always funny with some of these open\n source projects, like I have\n no idea what Fluentd means. What, how did, what's the name,\n where did it come from?\n Oh, okay. So originally, we wanted to make various data\n sources talk to various data,\n like back-end systems more fluently. So the original author\n of the project, Kisada, who\n also wrote MessagePack, which is a binary protocol, he\n wanted to call it Fluent. And\n that's why our GitHub username is Fluent. But then, um, he\n also realized that's not\n very Google-able.\n Yeah.\n Like when you type Fluent, there's like all sorts of like\n language websites, right?\n Right, right.\n So we just decided to add D, which, um, traditionally\n stands for daemon.\n Okay.\n So that's like stats D, or power syslog D.\n Oh, okay, so it's the Unix D.\n Yeah, Unix D. So that, that's the, the story.\n Oh, okay.\n So now it's Fluent/Fluentd is the project repo.\n So if somebody was interested in, in, you know, log aggreg\nation and collection, as we\n start to have more people running multiple servers and\n needing to aggregate data, um,\n what, what would they do to, to check out, like how, how do\n you recommend somebody?\n So our GitHub repo is a good place to start. Uh, so is our\n website, friendydontwork.com.\n And if you're familiar with Ruby, and I know not everyone\n is from the Ruby community, jam\n install Fluentd and you can get started right away.\n Is it like compatible back to 1.8, or is it?\n Uh, so we officially, I think, support 1.9.3 and above, and\n in the newer versions\n we're trying to slowly push the community to 2 and above.\n Yeah, I'll tell you, yeah, because now it's 2.0 is, is.\n Yeah, 2.0 is the, and our experimental, um, bleeding edge\n right now is trying to, uh,\n work off of 2.1.1.\n Okay.\n And Ruby has made a great performance, uh, progress over\n the past few years, and we want\n to take advantage of that.\n And as far as, as putting in the, the log aggregator, is it\n something that, uh, uh,\n a normal Rails developer could probably work through?\n Yeah, so that's the other great thing about Fluentd, like,\n uh, when we, when I tell people,\n especially not familiar with, like, writing Ruby systems\n code, is that, ooh, this is like\n system software.\n It's hard, it must be really hard to write plugins.\n Actually, I know a lot of engineers and programmers, or\n software writers, um, who learn to write\n Ruby, myself included, actually, partially, by writing,\n writing plugins for Fluentd.\n Oh, really?\n And there's only, like, a tiny bit of code that you need to\n write, and everything\n is really well-attracted, so that you really don't have to\n repeat what other people have\n already built.\n And, yeah, so it's pretty easy to get started.\n And you said that earlier, it's only about 5,000 lines for\n the code.\n Yeah, that's the core.\n Yeah, so the core.\n So it's probably a good idea for people to do, like, what D\nHH recommended, and that's\n just go read the source code.\n It's not...\n Yeah, um, it is, uh, it is a pretty small program, pretty,\n uh, well-documented.\n Not in the code, but that is something that we're working\n on.\n Okay.\n And, uh, there's a lot of documentation, and the mailing\n list is very active, like, when\n you post something, within 24 hours, someone's gonna\n respond.\n Great.\n Well, thank you very much for taking the time to...\n Thanks, Mike.\n Thanks.\n User groups with lots to say, interviews and more.\n No way!\n Sharing great ideas in the tech community.\n Fascinating conversations, a plethora of information.\n Find out for yourself today at ugtastic.com.\n Thank you.",

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at RailsConf 2014 and
 I’m sitting here with
 Kiyoto Tamura, who is a maintainer for the Fluentd log
 aggregation and data
 collector. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak
. What is a log
 aggregator/collector? Fluentd is a log aggregator/log
 collector written
 in Ruby and its key features are that it’s really
 lightweight, it’s a very small
 Ruby program augmented by extensible plugin architecture
 and it runs
 pretty fast for all sorts of logs. A lot of our customers
 collect data for
 like Apache Engine logs, Apache Nginx logs, syslogs,
 application logs and
 store them in like Elasticsearch, store them in MongoDB,
 copy the data, archive it,
 and so forth. We started a project two and a half years ago
 and the community has grown
 to be about like 50 regular contributors, thousands of
 users in the world including
 Slideshare and Nintendo. Yeah, Nintendo, that’s actually,
 that’s
 pretty cool. I mean, are you able to say how they’re using
 it?
 I’m actually not sure about the actual like, you know, how
 they use it, but I think
 it’s part of their like online games that are going on now.
 Okay. And basically like with all these companies, logs are
 very, very important.
 They want to centrally manage it and they want to do all
 sorts of operations
 on them. And before, like a lot of, like myself included,
 we would rsync, write a
 script here and there, but as like the number of your data
 sources increase and
 the number of storage systems you want to store and use
 increase, the complexity
 increases like exponentially. And we wanted 10 complexity,
 keep everything
 simple, and keep everything performantly.
 So how did you get involved in this project?
 Yeah, so I’m the, so the Fluentd was originally created by
 my employer, Treasure
 Data. And I’m employee number one. And when we first
 created the thing, we didn’t think
 it was going to be big, but one of our customers saw it and
 they were like, man, like we wish
 this was open source. And we sort of drew the inspiration
 from Heroku, who actually
 offers service as a pass.
 Okay.
 But they also like open source a lot of stuff. That’s
 really cool.
 Especially the stuff that runs on the client side. So we
 did the same. The community
 started to grow organically. Right now we have like a
 little short of like 1800 stars
 on GitHub and it’s been steadily rising.
 Oh, wow. That’s, so it’s, it’s a pretty well adopted.
 Yeah. I used to, I sometimes do the self-deprecating so
 that it is the law
 collector that nobody’s heard of.
 Right.
 But it’s actually pretty cool.
 Yeah. No, 1800 people have heard it at least.
 Yeah.
 Click that button.
 Yeah.
 So the, the contributions is are, do you, it’s open source,
 but how do you, how do you
 interact with the community? Do you have people like
 contributing patches or doing?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. So right now I think there are 18 people
 with commit rights. Three of
 them come from us, Treasure Data. It’s a fairly, it’s a
 very balanced community in the sense
 that we have commuters from like various companies. And
 although we started originally in Japan,
 we’re, Treasure Data’s founders are originally from Japan,
 starting to spread like a lot
 of the questions these days come from like all parts of the
 world. And as someone who
 constantly asks this question to the mailing list, I’m, I’m
 glad to see this adoption going
 global.
 And you know, it’s always funny with some of these open
 source projects, like I have
 no idea what Fluentd means. What, how did, what’s the name,
 where did it come from?
 Oh, okay. So originally, we wanted to make various data
 sources talk to various data,
 like back-end systems more fluently. So the original author
 of the project, Kisada, who
 also wrote MessagePack, which is a binary protocol, he
 wanted to call it Fluent. And
 that’s why our GitHub username is Fluent. But then, um, he
 also realized that’s not
 very Google-able.
 Yeah.
 Like when you type Fluent, there’s like all sorts of like
 language websites, right?
 Right, right.
 So we just decided to add D, which, um, traditionally
 stands for daemon.
 Okay.
 So that’s like stats D, or power syslog D.
 Oh, okay, so it’s the Unix D.
 Yeah, Unix D. So that, that’s the, the story.
 Oh, okay.
 So now it’s Fluent/Fluentd is the project repo.
 So if somebody was interested in, in, you know, log aggreg
ation and collection, as we
 start to have more people running multiple servers and
 needing to aggregate data, um,
 what, what would they do to, to check out, like how, how do
 you recommend somebody?
 So our GitHub repo is a good place to start. Uh, so is our
 website, friendydontwork.com.
 And if you’re familiar with Ruby, and I know not everyone
 is from the Ruby community, jam
 install Fluentd and you can get started right away.
 Is it like compatible back to 1.8, or is it?
 Uh, so we officially, I think, support 1.9.3 and above, and
 in the newer versions
 we’re trying to slowly push the community to 2 and above.
 Yeah, I’ll tell you, yeah, because now it’s 2.0 is, is.
 Yeah, 2.0 is the, and our experimental, um, bleeding edge
 right now is trying to, uh,
 work off of 2.1.1.
 Okay.
 And Ruby has made a great performance, uh, progress over
 the past few years, and we want
 to take advantage of that.
 And as far as, as putting in the, the log aggregator, is it
 something that, uh, uh,
 a normal Rails developer could probably work through?
 Yeah, so that’s the other great thing about Fluentd, like,
 uh, when we, when I tell people,
 especially not familiar with, like, writing Ruby systems
 code, is that, ooh, this is like
 system software.
 It’s hard, it must be really hard to write plugins.
 Actually, I know a lot of engineers and programmers, or
 software writers, um, who learn to write
 Ruby, myself included, actually, partially, by writing,
 writing plugins for Fluentd.
 Oh, really?
 And there’s only, like, a tiny bit of code that you need to
 write, and everything
 is really well-attracted, so that you really don’t have to
 repeat what other people have
 already built.
 And, yeah, so it’s pretty easy to get started.
 And you said that earlier, it’s only about 5,000 lines for
 the code.
 Yeah, that’s the core.
 Yeah, so the core.
 So it’s probably a good idea for people to do, like, what D
HH recommended, and that’s
 just go read the source code.
 It’s not…
 Yeah, um, it is, uh, it is a pretty small program, pretty,
 uh, well-documented.
 Not in the code, but that is something that we’re working
 on.
 Okay.
 And, uh, there’s a lot of documentation, and the mailing
 list is very active, like, when
 you post something, within 24 hours, someone’s gonna
 respond.
 Great.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to…

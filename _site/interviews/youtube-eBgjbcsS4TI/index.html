    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2014. I\n'm sitting here with Cindy Sprague,\n who helps with GOTO Conf. And help is a big word. She's been\n involved in helping to decide the\n location, the finally deciding on Chicago, and all that\n forward searching, scouting for locations,\n and then a lot of other stuff that's involved. And I just\n want to say thank you very much for\n taking the time to speak with me. Certainly. So what does\n helping mean? In the beginning,\n it was finding a venue that would actually take us because\n Chicago is very much a convention town.\n Right. So all the hotels are used to saying, well, if you\n're going to stay with us, you have\n to guarantee that every...\n Attendee will book a room and they want a huge financial\n guarantee right up front. That's not\n our model. Our model is to appeal to the local community.\n We do have people coming in from as\n far away as Poland. I met someone just yesterday. But\n mostly this is for the local community.\n So, you know, we're here in year two and we're back at the\n Drake Hotel.\n You know, when you were looking back...\n Now, let's see, over two years ago, three years ago now,\n and coming and talking to the hotels,\n what was finally brought you and what was some of the\n criteria you used to decide on\n going with the Drake in particular?\n Well, all the rest of the hotels said, you know, this is\n our model financially and put up or shut\n up. So we looked at a number of other venues trying to find\n some place that would fit because\n we like to have enough space. We like to have, you know,\n great catering as well as the ability to\n interact with speakers for all of the attendees. This hotel\n had a recent acquisition of a new sales\n manager came in and I approached her and said, so, you know\n, we spend a lot of money on catering\n because everybody wants to have a good time and they'll\n stay in and coffee and soda and all that,\n all that stuff. And they, the conversations in the hall are\n just as important.\n As the conversations in the, or the sessions, the providers\n, right? So they were actually willing\n to be flexible. They went to management and said, so let's\n look at something different and let's try\n this. So kind of the lesson I'm taking from that is if you\n're looking at a, at a location, don't\n just take that first one. You're going to have to go in\n there and dig. And I think I looked at\n 20 hotels as well as a couple of public venues around the\n city. So, yeah, so that was probably\n a lot of footwork right there. Yes. Lots of\n emails, lots of phone calls. But to go to the other aspect\n of it, from, from the venue to the\n community, what about the Chicago community? And again, I'm\n a part of the Chicago community,\n so I want to hear nice things, but in all seriousness, you\n've probably had a lot of choices\n across the country. What was it about Chicago that, that\n made it a destination for Goju?\n Well, it actually came out of a conversation that happened\n when we were doing consulting and I was\n in a number of other people and we had a large project here\n in Chicago and one night over beer,\n it was, why is there no major software development\n conference in Chicago when there are all these\n great tech people and lots of technology companies, but\n there isn't a focused software\n development conference? And that was eight years ago. Okay.\n So, you know, it was a lot of talking.\n Thoughts that have come from a long time. From a long time.\n Yes. And Chicago seems to be,\n we have a nice technology base here. There's a diversity of\n technologies.\n It's a really fun place to come. It's an easy place to get\n to for speakers because of O'Hare\n being a central airport. Yeah. So yeah, we have O'Hare and\n Midway and the metro that comes from\n all over. I know that's what I take. For instance, you know\n, Michael Nygaard, he's one of our speakers\n this year. He's a great, great speaker, but he's up in\n Minnesota and he's like, it's great to be able\n to go to a conference where I only have to get on one\n airplane. Yeah, not too many transfers. It's\n pretty direct. Yeah. And it's actually only maybe a day's\n drive from, depending on where he is.\n Yeah. But so you were looking at Chicago as being kind of\n ripe for having a major conference.\n That's right. And working with the communities, one of the\n unique things that I got to experience\n is that you don't just come in and plant a flag and say, we\n're going to host a conference.\n You do some outreach and interaction work with user groups\n and other local communities. Can you\n describe how you came, actually also describe how you came\n to the idea of doing that kind of\n interaction? Well, this is a conference about software\n development, but it's also by software\n developers. That community is skeptical always about value\n and they want to know that there's\n value. So they don't believe, you know, a marketing person\n like me, they want to hear it from a\n developer. So it just seemed to be a natural outreach to\n reach out to those developer groups,\n like all the meetups that are in town. One of the problems\n of course, is that they are skeptical. So\n they don't always answer my emails. When I say we have a\n network of over a thousand speakers that\n we've vetted and we can pick from them and invite them and\n they'll come because we asked them to.\n Right. And we, so, you know, we like to pair to improve the\n offerings in the community.\n With the user groups and provide them with a tech talk\n evening.\n Right. So it's the go-to nights.\n Go-to nights. Exactly. So I, you know, I will send an email\n to, you know, all the organizers of a\n given meetup and say, Hey, you know, we'd love to pair with\n you. We'll bring you a speaker and we'll\n pay for it. And all we want to do is to be able to, you\n know, stick up our go-to banner. You know,\n it's all about the speaker as opposed to go-to. Yeah. There\n's definitely a value. Even if you did\n nothing with that as a user group. Right. But there's\n definitely a value. Even if you did nothing\n with that as a user group. Right. And all we want to do is\n to be able to, you know, stick up our go-to\n user group organizer. Even if I did nothing with go-to\n after that, it's, it's a great opportunity\n to just have somebody come in and bring in a fresh talk,\n fresh idea that might come from outside of\n the normal sphere of, of, of local talent. We try to bring\n you somebody who's not\n normally here. Right. Okay. And was that something that you\n did for the first time with go-to or is\n that, that does that idea come from previous experience?\n Like where did that idea to do this\n kind of outreach come from? Um, the one, the person I know\n that doesn't the most in the\n start of this was, was Dave Thomas. Right. Uh, when he\n started with Yao, who was the, the kind of the\n parent company for, for go-to, um, he was doing it in\n Australia and he's been doing that in Australia\n for nine years. Okay. And that worked well there. It works\n well there. Brought the, brought that\n concept here. So it seemed to be the natural way to evolve,\n uh, a conference here. So. So if I'm in\n a, uh, in a region that it's, it's looking at go-to and\n seeing success here in Chicago.\n And I think that I'm in, you know, let's say Minnesota, St.\n Paul, Minnesota, for example,\n just cause we talked about Minnesota and, and I'm thinking,\n you know, we could,\n we have a tech community that could support a go-to\n conference and make it financially viable.\n What are some of the things I need to think about? Um, when\n I want to reach out to you, like,\n what would you like to hear that, that would make it so\n that way it would be financially feasible\n to bring something like a go-to to your city? Well, if you\n're going to be in a place that's\n hard to get to by an airplane, you better actually, you\n better have a list of sponsors\n say that we're going to help support this. Right. And is it\n also, uh, being able to present like the,\n the, the actual community itself? I mean, do you look at\n all of those things? Okay. For one thing,\n we, we started talking to all the speakers we knew about,\n you know, we're thinking about doing a go-to\n in Chicago. What do you think? And they were all, oh,\n Chicago would be great. We'd love to come to\n Chicago. Right. Because part of it at least is that it's a\n great destination and it's also easy\n to get to. And speakers, the good speakers are busy and\n they travel a lot. So, you know, sending\n them someplace that takes 10 or 12 hours to get to. Yeah.\n So, so sometimes you're just, if you're\n too far remote, it's going to be, it's pretty, it's kind of\n hard because that's one thing that\n I think is, is missing in, in understanding why these\n conferences are so expensive.\n When I, you look at it and I, I know I've suffered the\n sticker shock many times myself\n at $1,200 for a two day conference. Oh my gosh. I can't,\n you know, like fork that out\n or my company won't fork that out. But there's a reason for\n that, that, that, that dollar, uh,\n that, that, that price, it's not, it's not, uh, just an\n arbitrary number. Like, uh, last year you\n were describing that it actually wasn't even profitable. It\n was not, we lost money last year.\n It was an investment. So, yeah. So, but, and then here you\n are, so yet again,\n so you still see enough value to keep. We see a future.\n Okay. Because, you know, um,\n one of the reasons that we have a long list of speakers is\n that we do treat them well. And so if\n we say we're going to take that money, we're going to take\n it. We're going to take it. We're going to\n take care of you. They're more like, they, they trust us to\n, to do that and come into a conference.\n Um, so that takes that relationship that we've had. Um, I'm\n sorry, I've lost my train.\n No, the relationship with the, with the speaker community.\n Yeah. So that they want to come out.\n That's right. And, and be part of the conference. Yeah.\n Cause that was an interesting aspect is that\n like, you don't have a speaker room. No, we don't. That you\n, you push the speakers out. Nope. You're gonna\n go talk to people. Yes. Well, that's one of the reasons to\n put out all the really good food. And\n you may have noticed it just kept going, right? There was a\n break in another break and then there\n was lunch and then there was another break. Right. So, uh,\n including mimosas to start the morning.\n Yeah. Yeah. I saw that. I knew I had a long day, so I didn\n't get to partake. They look delicious.\n Well, the whole point is to, to get people to stay out in\n the halls when they're not in a, in a,\n in a, listening to a presentation so that you do actually\n do get to walk out. Yeah. So that you do get to walk out at\n the end of the day.\n So that you do actually do get to walk up to Adrian Cockcro\nft for instance, and say,\n and engage him in the conversation, right? Oh, it certainly\n made my job easier.\n So, all right. Well, I want to say thank you very much for\n taking the time to speak with me. Thank\n you very much. And thank you for letting me come and do\n these interviews as a, as GOTO Conf. They've\n been a lot of fun, two years in a row. Very good. Thanks.\n Thank you. User groups with lots to say,\n interviews and more. No way. Sharing great ideas in the\n tech community. Fascinating\n conversations, a plethora of information.

 We do have people coming in from as

 So, you know, we’re here in year two and we’re back at the
 Drake Hotel.
 You know, when you were looking back…
 Now, let’s see, over two years ago, three years ago now,
 and coming and talking to the hotels,
 what was finally brought you and what was some of the
 criteria you used to decide on
 going with the Drake in particular?
 Well, all the rest of the hotels said, you know, this is

 all that stuff. And they, the conversations in the hall are

 As the conversations in the, or the sessions, the providers

 this year. He’s a great, great speaker, but he’s up in
 Minnesota and he’s like, it’s great to be able
 to go to a conference where I only have to get on one
 airplane. Yeah, not too many transfers. It’s
 pretty direct. Yeah. And it’s actually only maybe a day’s
 drive from, depending on where he is.
 Yeah. But so you were looking at Chicago as being kind of
 ripe for having a major conference.
 That’s right. And working with the communities, one of the
 unique things that I got to experience
 is that you don’t just come in and plant a flag and say, we
‘re going to host a conference.
 You do some outreach and interaction work with user groups
 and other local communities. Can you
 describe how you came, actually also describe how you came
 to the idea of doing that kind of
 interaction? Well, this is a conference about software
 development, but it’s also by software
 developers. That community is skeptical always about value
 and they want to know that there’s
 value. So they don’t believe, you know, a marketing person
 like me, they want to hear it from a
 developer. So it just seemed to be a natural outreach to
 reach out to those developer groups,
 like all the meetups that are in town. One of the problems
 of course, is that they are skeptical. So
 they don’t always answer my emails. When I say we have a
 network of over a thousand speakers that
 we’ve vetted and we can pick from them and invite them and
 they’ll come because we asked them to.
 Right. And we, so, you know, we like to pair to improve the
 offerings in the community.
 With the user groups and provide them with a tech talk
 evening.
 Right. So it’s the go-to nights.
 Go-to nights. Exactly. So I, you know, I will send an email
 to, you know, all the organizers of a
 given meetup and say, Hey, you know, we’d love to pair with
 you. We’ll bring you a speaker and we’ll
 pay for it. And all we want to do is to be able to, you
 know, stick up our go-to banner. You know,
 it’s all about the speaker as opposed to go-to. Yeah. There
‘s definitely a value. Even if you did
 nothing with that as a user group. Right. But there’s
 definitely a value. Even if you did nothing
 with that as a user group. Right. And all we want to do is
 to be able to, you know, stick up our go-to
 user group organizer. Even if I did nothing with go-to
 after that, it’s, it’s a great opportunity
 to just have somebody come in and bring in a fresh talk,
 fresh idea that might come from outside of
 the normal sphere of, of, of local talent. We try to bring
 you somebody who’s not
 normally here. Right. Okay. And was that something that you
 did for the first time with go-to or is
 that, that does that idea come from previous experience?
 Like where did that idea to do this
 kind of outreach come from? Um, the one, the person I know
 that doesn’t the most in the
 start of this was, was Dave Thomas. Right. Uh, when he
 started with Yao, who was the, the kind of the
 parent company for, for go-to, um, he was doing it in
 Australia and he’s been doing that in Australia
 for nine years. Okay. And that worked well there. It works
 well there. Brought the, brought that
 concept here. So it seemed to be the natural way to evolve,
 uh, a conference here. So. So if I’m in
 a, uh, in a region that it’s, it’s looking at go-to and
 seeing success here in Chicago.
 And I think that I’m in, you know, let’s say Minnesota, St.
 Paul, Minnesota, for example,
 just cause we talked about Minnesota and, and I’m thinking,
 you know, we could,
 we have a tech community that could support a go-to
 conference and make it financially viable.
 What are some of the things I need to think about? Um, when
 I want to reach out to you, like,
 what would you like to hear that, that would make it so
 that way it would be financially feasible
 to bring something like a go-to to your city? Well, if you
‘re going to be in a place that’s
 hard to get to by an airplane, you better actually, you
 better have a list of sponsors
 say that we’re going to help support this. Right. And is it
 also, uh, being able to present like the,
 the, the actual community itself? I mean, do you look at
 all of those things? Okay. For one thing,
 we, we started talking to all the speakers we knew about,
 you know, we’re thinking about doing a go-to
 in Chicago. What do you think? And they were all, oh,
 Chicago would be great. We’d love to come to
 Chicago. Right. Because part of it at least is that it’s a
 great destination and it’s also easy
 to get to. And speakers, the good speakers are busy and
 they travel a lot. So, you know, sending
 them someplace that takes 10 or 12 hours to get to. Yeah.
 So, so sometimes you’re just, if you’re
 too far remote, it’s going to be, it’s pretty, it’s kind of
 hard because that’s one thing that
 I think is, is missing in, in understanding why these
 conferences are so expensive.
 When I, you look at it and I, I know I’ve suffered the
 sticker shock many times myself
 at $1,200 for a two day conference. Oh my gosh. I can’t,
 you know, like fork that out
 or my company won’t fork that out. But there’s a reason for
 that, that, that, that dollar, uh,
 that, that, that price, it’s not, it’s not, uh, just an
 arbitrary number. Like, uh, last year you
 were describing that it actually wasn’t even profitable. It
 was not, we lost money last year.
 It was an investment. So, yeah. So, but, and then here you
 are, so yet again,
 so you still see enough value to keep. We see a future.
 Okay. Because, you know, um,
 one of the reasons that we have a long list of speakers is
 that we do treat them well. And so if
 we say we’re going to take that money, we’re going to take
 it. We’re going to take it. We’re going to
 take care of you. They’re more like, they, they trust us to
, to do that and come into a conference.
 Um, so that takes that relationship that we’ve had. Um, I’m
 sorry, I’ve lost my train.
 No, the relationship with the, with the speaker community.
 Yeah. So that they want to come out.
 That’s right. And, and be part of the conference. Yeah.
 Cause that was an interesting aspect is that
 like, you don’t have a speaker room. No, we don’t. That you
, you push the speakers out. Nope. You’re gonna
 go talk to people. Yes. Well, that’s one of the reasons to
 put out all the really good food. And
 you may have noticed it just kept going, right? There was a
 break in another break and then there
 was lunch and then there was another break. Right. So, uh,
 including mimosas to start the morning.
 Yeah. Yeah. I saw that. I knew I had a long day, so I didn
‘t get to partake. They look delicious.
 Well, the whole point is to, to get people to stay out in
 the halls when they’re not in a, in a,
 in a, listening to a presentation so that you do actually
 do get to walk out. Yeah. So that you do get to walk out at
 the end of the day.
 So that you do actually do get to walk up to Adrian Cockcro
ft for instance, and say,
 and engage him in the conversation, right? Oh, it certainly
 made my job easier.
 So, all right. Well, I want to say thank you very much for
 taking the time to speak with me. Thank
 you very much. And thank you for letting me come and do
 these interviews as a, as GOTO Conf. They’ve
 been a lot of fun, two years in a row. Very good. Thanks.

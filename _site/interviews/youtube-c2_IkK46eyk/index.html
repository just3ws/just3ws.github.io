    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here at GOTO Conf 2015. I'm\n sitting here with\n Alexandra Masterson who is the conference organizer today\n and thank you\n very much for taking the time to speak with me. Now\n conference manager, I said\n conference organizer, conference manager, what is the\n conference manager\n and how did you come into that position? So essentially the\n conference manager\n is someone who just makes sure that everything is running\n smoothly, makes\n sure sponsors are happy, that things like this are\n happening at the\n conference, that people outside of the space can interact\n and see what's\n going on. Also just to make sure attendees are happy as\n well. That's the most important thing.\n You're kind of like the MC, the party host, making sure\n everybody's got enough to drink, you need\n more coffee, just kind of making sure everybody's having a\n good time\n and has what they need. And you've actually helped me\n because I needed an iron for this earlier.\n So you've been very helpful and I also appreciate this room\n which none of you\n can see but it's very nice. It's beautiful. And it's quiet\n too. So, you know, GOTO Conf\n and how do you came to be the conference manager? You know,\n first off it\n was, did you come to GOTO Conf or did you happen to grow\n into a role with GOTO?\n Yeah, so I actually met my company Trifork while I was at\n my sister's\n conference, Scala Days Amsterdam in Berlin. Oh, so tech\n conferences are a family thing. Yeah, apparently.\n We kind of fell into that. And I met Trifork there and I\n had past experience\n with conferences and so we just kind of grew our\n relationship from there. And\n Nealey is our original conference manager, but she is on\n maternity leave. Yes,\n she is probably having a baby right now. She has had her\n baby. Oh, yeah, she has had her baby. It's a little boy.\n Congratulations, Nealey. And yes, that's wonderful. Yeah,\n last year we interviewed with Nealey and she's been a\n fantastic supporter of UGtastic, so best of luck and best\n health to her. So, but\n here at GOTO Conf, you know, looking at the ramp up to this\n year, there were some\n interesting events that took place and one of those was a\n meta meetup. Can you tell me a\n little bit about the ramp up or the road to GOTO Conf? Yeah,\n so we like to do, A, the\n Chicago tech community is really important to us and we're\n just essentially trying to build and\n strengthen that community feel. So we like to host events,\n bring speakers to certain user groups who\n are looking for speakers. We work with the Chicago Java\n user group a lot. We've worked with Vivek at\n Morningstar. And we also host a meta GOTO Night, which is\n for meetup organizers, community leaders,\n tech influencers to kind of come together, brainstorm and\n trade ideas on\n what they want to see from the Chicago tech community. Yeah\n, and I've been\n involved in some of those, and they're really interesting\n because it's bringing\n the GOTO banner as a kind of a rallying point for groups\n that might not otherwise\n interact together. Yeah, so yeah, it's great. I mean, that\n's one of the unique things I see about GOTO Conf.\n Not only that you guys keep inviting me to come back and do\n interviews, but that you're\n really actually focused on not just, oh, this is a day of\n conference or a week of conference,\n but then there's this whole kind of buzz building and ramp\n up to the actual day of the event. Yeah,\n we want the community to make sure that we know that we're\n involved and we want to support you\n guys and make sure that we can help as much as we can to\n make it the best that it can be. So one\n last question. As a conference organizer, I always hear\n about the one thing they\n would like to have their attendees keep in mind that helps\n with things like\n costs and things like that. One thing I've heard in years\n past is water,\n another is the cost of coffee. So if you were to say, like,\n conference\n attendees, please do this one thing. Is there anything you\n can think of that you\n would say as advice? Maybe, I guess, just for our\n conferences in particular, one of\n the questions that we get the most is what is the Wi-Fi\n password? And all of our Wi-Fi passwords are\n actually cleverly located on the bottom of our badge on the\n front page. So if you are curious\n what your Wi-Fi password is, it's right there. It's also at\n the bottom. So just read your badge.\n This is a Bible of information. Yeah. And it's one of the\n interesting things about GOTO Conf in,\n in itself, is that you guys have this, all the information\n is right around the\n neck. Yeah. And I was commenting on that on a little\n preview video earlier that\n it's something I think all conferences should consider if\n they have the budget\n for it. Yeah, it's, these badges are amazing. They have our\n full schedule,\n speakers, sponsors, maps of the venue, and QR code readers\n so that sponsors and\n other attendees can scan each other and stay connected. Yep\n. So yeah, so there's,\n there's value that, you know, when we click on an ad on a\n web page, you know,\n we're helping support that web page, but when you come to a\n conference and you\n let the, the sponsors, the vendors, scan your badge, they\n know that they're\n getting value here at the conference, so they want to come\n back. Yeah. Okay, so remember\n your badge. It's got everything you need. It's your Swiss\n Army tool badge. Well, thank you very much, Alexandra.\n Thank you, Mike.\n I appreciate it, and I appreciate being here at GOTO Conf\n again.\n Thanks for coming.",

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015. I’m
 sitting here with
 Alexandra Masterson who is the conference organizer today
 and thank you
 very much for taking the time to speak with me. Now
 conference manager, I said
 conference organizer, conference manager, what is the
 conference manager
 and how did you come into that position? So essentially the
 conference manager
 is someone who just makes sure that everything is running
 smoothly, makes
 sure sponsors are happy, that things like this are
 happening at the
 conference, that people outside of the space can interact
 and see what’s
 going on. Also just to make sure attendees are happy as
 well. That’s the most important thing.
 You’re kind of like the MC, the party host, making sure
 everybody’s got enough to drink, you need
 more coffee, just kind of making sure everybody’s having a
 good time
 and has what they need. And you’ve actually helped me
 because I needed an iron for this earlier.
 So you’ve been very helpful and I also appreciate this room
 which none of you
 can see but it’s very nice. It’s beautiful. And it’s quiet
 too. So, you know, GOTO Conf
 and how do you came to be the conference manager? You know,
 first off it
 was, did you come to GOTO Conf or did you happen to grow
 into a role with GOTO?
 Yeah, so I actually met my company Trifork while I was at
 my sister’s
 conference, Scala Days Amsterdam in Berlin. Oh, so tech
 conferences are a family thing. Yeah, apparently.
 We kind of fell into that. And I met Trifork there and I
 had past experience
 with conferences and so we just kind of grew our
 relationship from there. And
 Nealey is our original conference manager, but she is on
 maternity leave. Yes,
 she is probably having a baby right now. She has had her
 baby. Oh, yeah, she has had her baby. It’s a little boy.
 Congratulations, Nealey. And yes, that’s wonderful. Yeah,
 last year we interviewed with Nealey and she’s been a
 fantastic supporter of UGtastic, so best of luck and best
 health to her. So, but
 here at GOTO Conf, you know, looking at the ramp up to this
 year, there were some
 interesting events that took place and one of those was a
 meta meetup. Can you tell me a
 little bit about the ramp up or the road to GOTO Conf? Yeah,
 so we like to do, A, the
 Chicago tech community is really important to us and we’re
 just essentially trying to build and
 strengthen that community feel. So we like to host events,
 bring speakers to certain user groups who
 are looking for speakers. We work with the Chicago Java

 Morningstar. And we also host a meta GOTO Night, which is
 for meetup organizers, community leaders,
 tech influencers to kind of come together, brainstorm and
 trade ideas on
 what they want to see from the Chicago tech community. Yeah
, and I’ve been
 involved in some of those, and they’re really interesting
 because it’s bringing
 the GOTO banner as a kind of a rallying point for groups
 that might not otherwise
 interact together. Yeah, so yeah, it’s great. I mean, that
‘s one of the unique things I see about GOTO Conf.
 Not only that you guys keep inviting me to come back and do
 interviews, but that you’re
 really actually focused on not just, oh, this is a day of

 but then there’s this whole kind of buzz building and ramp
 up to the actual day of the event. Yeah,
 we want the community to make sure that we know that we’re

 This is a Bible of information. Yeah. And it’s one of the

. So yeah, so there’s,
 there’s value that, you know, when we click on an ad on a

 we’re helping support that web page, but when you come to a
 conference and you
 let the, the sponsors, the vendors, scan your badge, they
 know that they’re
 getting value here at the conference, so they want to come
 back. Yeah. Okay, so remember
 your badge. It’s got everything you need. It’s your Swiss
 Army tool badge. Well, thank you very much, Alexandra.
 Thank you, Mike.
 I appreciate it, and I appreciate being here at GOTO Conf
 again.
 Thanks for coming.</p>

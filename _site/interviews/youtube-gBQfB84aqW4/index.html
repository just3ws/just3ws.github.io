    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike with UGtastic. I'm here again at GOTO Conf\n 2014, and well, this\n interview is a little different than most of them, where I\n've talked with\n people that maybe are in the community that I don't\n necessarily know, but Ryan\n Gary here is a friend of mine who's been, we've co-organ\nized user groups together,\n we've known each other, we've been to each other's houses,\n and you know, our\n kids have played together, but we met at a conference, much\n like GOTO Conf.\n You're at SCNA 2009, Software craftsmanship North America.\n I can\n remember you were sitting at the table, and I walked up to\n him like, \"Hi, I'm Mike.\n Where are you from?\" Because I just wanted to engage with\n somebody, and it turned out we live in the same neck of the\n woods. Yeah, which is\n fairly uncommon. Yeah. Usually it's someone who either\n lives in like the city, which\n is far from us, or they live in another state, so it's like\n, \"What? You live like 15\n minutes from my house?\" But it was just that chance, you\n know, that when you\n open yourself up at a conference, and that's kind of what I\n'm getting at, is\n when you open yourself up to these opportunities, you never\n know what's going\n to come out of them, but at one moment, we didn't know each\n other, and then now we're\n you know, here years later, having run a user group\n together, and you know, been\n friends for a while. So I would normally say, \"Thank you\n for taking the time to\n speak with me,\" but I don't have to thank you, but no,\n thank you for taking the\n time to be on the camera, though. So Ryan, right now you're\n the one that's leading\n up SCMC. SCMC is a group we started together. It's Software\n Craftsmanship McHenry County, but for the last\n year or plus, you've been kind of running it solo. How's it\n going?\n Good, good! I'm not completely running it solo, so Mike Ros\nselli is\n helping me as well. I need to bring in more people, so user\n groups\n are great. It's been going well. What I find is that I will\n have a backlog of\n like three topics lined up, and then we'll get to that\n backlog, and then I'll\n have a month where it's like, \"Oh boy, I don't have\n anything.\" So yeah, like I need to\n pull something out and just make something up, which has\n worked before.\n You can have really good discussions, and we had one of\n those back in November,\n and it went really well, but it's kind of like feast or\n famine, and you have to\n constantly be keeping that backlog going. So having a\n bigger\n leadership team helps with that problem. Yeah, because you\n can split the net a\n little bit. Yeah, exactly. And that's one of the things is\n that the SCMC is a\n far suburban group. It is, yeah. Yeah, so we live in the\n Chicago metropolitan area,\n and there's a ton of user groups in downtown Chicago. There\n are some user\n groups spread around the suburbs, but Mike and I live\n pretty far northwest of\n the city. About 50-60 miles off the city. Yeah, and there\n were no technical user\n groups out there, but there are a decent amount of\n developers out there, because\n people move there because it's affordable housing, whatever\n reason. You know, the whole point\n for me of the group was really to foster that local\n development community, because I\n think it so easily gets overshadowed with what's happening\n in downtown Chicago, and\n it's really about, you know, establishing those\n relationships between the people\n in that area. Yeah, yeah, there was, I mean, there's Foll\nett that is out there, which\n is a very large library services company. In education. In\n education,\n and then before there was TicketsNow, which is now being\n consumed by Ticketmaster,\n moved away, but there's still a lot of developers that live\n out that way then,\n that are, they commute in, or they work, and then there's\n no real community around\n technical. Yeah, so originally Mike and I started the group\n. Mike did the most of\n the initial setup, and it was originally, the topic was\n cloud development, cloud\n computing, and yeah, we did that for what, about a year and\n a half? Yeah, and then\n just, we ran out of topics, and we're like, yeah, let's do\n something different, and so we kind of have that. And that\n was like 2009,\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, 2010 is when we first had our first SCMC\n meeting, and then we\n brought Jim in from 8th Light. Yeah, Jim Suchy from 8th\n Light. And that was the first time we actually had\n like a corporate sponsor, so that's what Follett sponsored\n our location, and that\n helped out a lot. Yeah, yeah. And you know, Follett would\n also sponsor food, 8th Light would sponsor food,\n you were working at Groupon at the time, they would sponsor\n food, so having like that, that corporate\n support was a really, really big help. The other thing that\n really increased our attendance at\n meetings was when we switched to meetup.com. Right, yeah.\n Which was surprising, because you know,\n we wouldn't expect that that would have that dramatic\n impact, it really did, I want to say\n like a 50% increase. Well, discoverability. Yeah, yeah,\n yeah. You know, and they do some help with,\n if you're already a member for one group, they send you\n alerts. They'll suggest, yeah. For areas,\n stuff that might be near you or in your interests. And meet\nup.com auto-nags people to come\n to your user group when it gets closer to the date, so that\n's helpful too. Yeah. So, yeah, so\n and that actually, even though we didn't have a corporate\n sponsor for the cloud developers group,\n we met at a Panera, we met at a local bar, the first\n meeting was at a library, but you know,\n but that was okay. Yeah, yeah. You know, that was, we had\n to power through that. We did. You know,\n it wasn't always easy, it was sometimes quite painful, but\n you know, it goes into something that I've been talking\n about, about building community in 24 months. And one of\n those things is it doesn't really matter\n where you meet, because when you're trying to build a\n community, it's not necessarily that\n you're at a Follett or at a Groupon or at an A-Flight. Yeah\n. It's like you're just somewhere\n where people get together and talk shop, talk about\n whatever, talk about whatever is on their\n mind with, with, with a community and can speak a similar\n language and feel some empathy toward\n each other because we share common interests and industry.\n But now you're, you're kind of expanding\n and you're doing another new informal meetup. So you're,\n you've got the bug for, for organizing.\n What is this little, you've been doing a coffee, kind of\n like a Coden coffee kind of thing.\n Yeah. So I, let me tell you the history of that. So I\n started working from home about three years ago,\n full-time and I was working with people also like in, in\n our area and we would just get together to\n work at coffee shops. And since then, like that group that\n I was working with has spread apart\n and you know, we're working for different companies, but it\n's still really nice to get to\n that group together still to this day and like hang out at\n a coffee shop, see how we're doing,\n you know, even, even like we'll collaborate on, on\n technology things. So so yeah, I have become the\n social director of a coffee shop. Yeah.\n Of the informal McHenry county meetup at a coffee shop\n group.\n Great acronym. So just a bunch of letters, just throw it in\n.\n I probably should formalize it and even, even put it on\n meetup.com,\n but that's kind of what I've done so far.\n But it goes to show like how you can do community in, in a\n variety of ways.\n Yeah. Yeah.\n And, and, and even can just foster those relationships that\n we have at work.\n Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And\n I think a lot of motivation for me behind the coffee shop\n stuff is I actually heard on a podcast\n like five years ago that there was this small city, like a\n hundred miles outside of Paris.\n And a lot of people worked from home and worked from\n wherever their company was in a major\n European city, but they had this coworking space where they\n would get together for half the day,\n just so they had that camaraderie. So that's, you know,\n living in McHenry county,\n you either have an extreme commute or you work,\n work locally or you work from home. So like having that,\n that attachment to the communities is really helpful.\n Right. All right. Well, Ryan,\n I'll see you in a few minutes, but thanks for taking the\n time to chat on camera. It's been\n too long. Yeah. Thanks.\n Thank you. All right. Bye.\n User groups with lots to say, interviews and more. No way.\n Sharing great ideas in the tech\n community. Fascinating conversations, a plethora of\n information. Find out for yourself today at\n tattastic.com.",

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here again at GOTO Conf
 2014, and well, this
 interview is a little different than most of them, where I
‘ve talked with
 people that maybe are in the community that I don’t
 necessarily know, but Ryan
 Gary here is a friend of mine who’s been, we’ve co-organ
ized user groups together,
 we’ve known each other, we’ve been to each other’s houses,
 and you know, our
 kids have played together, but we met at a conference, much
 like GOTO Conf.
 You’re at SCNA 2009, Software craftsmanship North America.
 I can
 remember you were sitting at the table, and I walked up to
 him like, “Hi, I’m Mike.
 Where are you from?” Because I just wanted to engage with
 somebody, and it turned out we live in the same neck of the
 woods. Yeah, which is
 fairly uncommon. Yeah. Usually it’s someone who either
 lives in like the city, which
 is far from us, or they live in another state, so it’s like
, “What? You live like 15
 minutes from my house?” But it was just that chance, you
 know, that when you
 open yourself up at a conference, and that’s kind of what I
‘m getting at, is
 when you open yourself up to these opportunities, you never

 you know, here years later, having run a user group

 friends for a while. So I would normally say, “Thank you

 speak with me,” but I don’t have to thank you, but no,
 thank you for taking the
 time to be on the camera, though. So Ryan, right now you’re
 the one that’s leading
 up SCMC. SCMC is a group we started together. It’s Software
 Craftsmanship McHenry County, but for the last
 year or plus, you’ve been kind of running it solo. How’s it
 going?
 Good, good! I’m not completely running it solo, so Mike Ros
selli is
 helping me as well. I need to bring in more people, so user
 groups
 are great. It’s been going well. What I find is that I will
 have a backlog of
 like three topics lined up, and then we’ll get to that
 backlog, and then I’ll
 have a month where it’s like, “Oh boy, I don’t have
 anything.” So yeah, like I need to
 pull something out and just make something up, which has
 worked before.
 You can have really good discussions, and we had one of
 those back in November,
 and it went really well, but it’s kind of like feast or
 famine, and you have to
 constantly be keeping that backlog going. So having a
 bigger
 leadership team helps with that problem. Yeah, because you
 can split the net a

 and that actually, even though we didn’t have a corporate

 But now you’re, you’re kind of expanding
 and you’re doing another new informal meetup. So you’re,
 you’ve got the bug for, for organizing.
 What is this little, you’ve been doing a coffee, kind of
 like a Coden coffee kind of thing.
 Yeah. So I, let me tell you the history of that. So I
 started working from home about three years ago,
 full-time and I was working with people also like in, in
 our area and we would just get together to
 work at coffee shops. And since then, like that group that
 I was working with has spread apart
 and you know, we’re working for different companies, but it
‘s still really nice to get to
 that group together still to this day and like hang out at
 a coffee shop, see how we’re doing,
 you know, even, even like we’ll collaborate on, on
 technology things. So so yeah, I have become the
 social director of a coffee shop. Yeah.
 Of the informal McHenry county meetup at a coffee shop
 group.
 Great acronym. So just a bunch of letters, just throw it in
.
 I probably should formalize it and even, even put it on
 meetup.com,
 but that’s kind of what I’ve done so far.
 But it goes to show like how you can do community in, in a
 variety of ways.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 And, and, and even can just foster those relationships that
 we have at work.
 Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And
 I think a lot of motivation for me behind the coffee shop
 stuff is I actually heard on a podcast
 like five years ago that there was this small city, like a
 hundred miles outside of Paris.
 And a lot of people worked from home and worked from
 wherever their company was in a major
 European city, but they had this coworking space where they
 would get together for half the day,
 just so they had that camaraderie. So that’s, you know,
 living in McHenry county,
 you either have an extreme commute or you work,
 work locally or you work from home. So like having that,
 that attachment to the communities is really helpful.
 Right. All right. Well, Ryan,
 I’ll see you in a few minutes, but thanks for taking the
 time to chat on camera. It’s been
 too long. Yeah. Thanks.
 Thank you. All right. Bye.

    "description": "The Reactive Framework (Rx) is a programming model for dealing with asynchronous data streams, specifically in the context of distributed computing. It was developed by Erik Meijer while he was working at Microsoft and has since become an open-source project. Rx provides a set of libraries and tools for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators. It is designed to allow developers to easily build responsive and resilient systems that can handle high volumes of data and handle failures gracefully. Rx is implemented in a number of programming languages, including C#, Java, and JavaScript, and has been widely adopted in the software industry.",

    "transcript": "Hi, it's Mike again with UGtastic. I'm sitting down at GOTO\nChicago with Eric Meyer. Eric Meyer is,\n well if you've worked with Microsoft technologies over the\n last decade, you've worked with something\n that Eric has created or been a part of, from C# to the\n Azure cloud platform. Now you're away from\n Microsoft and you're working a lot more on the open source\n world. Well, first off, thank you for\n sitting down with me, but can you tell me a little bit\n about what this platform that you just spoke\n about, this reactive framework, what is that and what is\n that? Okay, so I can try to explain that\n in general terms because that I think is also where you\n mentioned open source, where the kind of\n the value of open source comes in. So the thing is if you\n're trying to compose software, in my view,\n there are four different kinds of effects that as a\n developer you have that you have to take\n into account. So let's look at the simple, you know, when\n you're doing, when you're programming\n Java and you're calling a method, typically the method\n returns one value and that method is actually\n synchronously. So you call, you know, two string and, you\n know, that call blocks and then returns\n a single string. Right. Right. So that's kind of the\n simplest synchronous call that returns one\n value. So input, wait, output. Yes. Now the second thing\n that what you do is that if you\n make a call, synchronous call, and what you get back is a\n collection of values,\n like an iterable in Java. Right. So you make a call and now\n you get back an iterable, but\n that iterable represents multiple values, but also they are\n synchronous because you, you call next,\n next, next, and each call to next is blocking. Right. Okay.\n But the, the, the, the important\n thing is that there's two, you know, ways to compose your\n program. One where you have a\n single result and one where you have multiple results. And\n then, you know, when you have\n multiple results, you loop over that and, and so on. But\n those are for, for synchronous programs,\n those are the two kind of main, um, ways to compose your\n program. Now let's go to the\n asynchronous case because that's the very important now\n that we're moving to more kind of, you know,\n distributed world. When you make a call, you don't want to\n be blocked because there's like latency,\n errors, whatever, you know, we all know the kind of fall\nacies of distributed computing.\n So what you want to do is you want, you want to make these\n calls asynchronous. Right. Now,\n and there's a lot of, uh, talk these days in JavaScript, in\n many languages about how to deal\n with asynchronous calls. And in my opinion, when you have\n an asynchronous call that returns a single value,\n um, what you do is you return some kind of future or, you\n know, promise or whatever,\n how you want to call it. And then .NET, that is, they use\n the type task for that. So a task\n represents a computation that is asynchronous, that has a\n single result. So you make a call,\n you get back this thing that represents, you know, a\n promise that, you know,\n there will be a value at some point. Um, now what Rx is, is\n that it complements,\n this picture by having, what happens if you have something\n that returns multiple results\n asynchronously. So say you make, um, the most natural\n examples, maybe Twitter, you make a call,\n you send a query to Twitter, and what you get back is a\n stream of all the tweets. Right. And you're\n not asking, give me the next tweet. No, Twitter will kind\n of, you know, notify you when the next tweet.\n Just pulls up a buffer, kind of.\n Well, it just notifies you with events or something, or\n like your, and even on your local machine, if\n you're doing, um, events processing, like your mouse moves,\n or so on, you're not asking the mouse,\n give me the next mouse move. Right. You get notified, so\n you get a sequence of, of collections.\n Sorry. Probably shouldn't drink, uh, soda. It's okay. Um,\n now, so, so, so what Rx is, is it, it's\n trying to kind of, you know, deal with asynchronous comput\nations with streams of data, asynchronous data streams. Okay\n.\n And, and, and, and if you look at languages like Erlang,\n they have embraced that, that same paradigm for a long time\n, right?\n Where you do message passing, you have two different agents\n that send messages to each other, um, and, and so what\n this is trying to do is to define an interface that you can\n put on, on different services, and then you can glue\n these things together using this interface.\n Okay. Uh, a lot of the examples you gave were in, in .NET.\n Is this a .NET only thing?\n Ah, that's a very good question.\n So one of the, um, things is that since this is an, an\n abstract interface in the sense of abstract, it's a concept\nually abstract, there's no language\n dependency. So we, we, we, um, on the open source side, it\n's like, you know, rx.codeplex.com.\n Okay.\n Where we open source this. We have versions for JavaScript,\n for .NET, and for C++. The C++ one is not as mature.\n Right.\n Um, then Netflix has written a Java implement.\n It's a Java implementation. Um, GitHub has written an\n Objective-C implementation, and in Dart, uh, Google has the\n Dart streams library, which is also, um, based on these\n principles.\n Okay.\n And then other people have done, like, Python, and, and\n Ruby, and so there's, like, you know, again, this idea of\n having asynchronous data streams is not tied at all to a\n single language, and that's exactly also what I want,\n because you don't know if you're on, on the server side,\n use Java, and how to use Java.\n And I, on the client side, use JavaScript, and I still want\n to, kind of, exchange, you know, events with you.\n Right.\n So, um, that's, I think, very important that, that it's not\n tied to a particular language.\n Okay. So it's a little bit more like a protocol?\n It's a little bit more like, like, like, like a protocol.\n Okay.\n Um, because the, the, the, what we call the Rx grammar, or\n the Rx design guidelines, so if, if you and I are exch\nanging messages, um, what the protocol says is, like, what\n is the, you know, how are the messages represented, what is\n the binary format, or what is the kind of, you know, what\n is the state machine that we use?\n So Rx has a very simple state machine like that, so I can\n send you a number of messages that are ordered, and then I\n can terminate that stream successfully, that means you don\n't get any more.\n I can say something went wrong, and then, you know, so that\n's really the, the, the, the protocol that, that there is,\n but it, it, it makes certain kind of assumptions, so, but,\n what, what is, you know, I, I'm, I'm not so sure if, if it\n's really relevant to make a distinction between a protocol\n and an API, because you can also say, if you have an API\n for files, right, you have to, you open your file, you\n write, and you read, and you close the file, that's kind of\n a protocol, too.\n So, for me, I'm, yeah, I don't, it's somewhere in, in\n between, it's a, well, I, I think, I, I like to emphasize\n what, what is the same instead of what's different, so\n there are certain ways that you should use, or expectations\n of, in what order you make calls, and, and whether you want\n to call that a protocol or not, I mean, that, I'm fine with\n either way.\n Well, is it kind of like if, if you start to use the word\n protocol, it becomes kind of rust, and it becomes dogmatic.\n Yes.\n And then, then people.\n Because protocol is very formal, and it's like, everybody\n has to do it exactly this way, and if you don't do it this\n way, you're not, you're not reactive.\n Yes.\n That's the next thing you're going to say, this isn't rust\nful, this isn't reactive.\n Yes, and, and, and so I'm trying to be very easygoing with\n that, because, for example, you know, if you have an\n existing service, for example, I, I, I'm, in the past weeks\n, I've implemented a wrapper for Logly, which is a, is a, a\n logging service, so what you can do is you can send it\n values, you know,\n events you know whatever they're just like fight streams\n and then you can query them later so it's\n like now what i did is i wrapped that in a reactive you\n know shell right and so the underlying thing\n doesn't know anything about rx and you know it's just\n whatever you know the rest api that that the\n locally guys and exposed but now you know by making your\n client library you know talk rx now\n there's no difference between you know um locally or your\n mouse and so now you can kind of you know\n mesh together you know things that come from locally with\n your mouse or and you can visualize\n it so it allows you to compose so by by making exposing all\n these things with the same interface\n then you can compose them\n but you you don't force the interface kind of you know all\n the way down so that's kind of you know\n so you can always it's like bridging the protocols right\n you can always you know and one of the\n things i think about that's interesting for as a is more of\n a i i'm a business developer i'm\n going to implement just an implementer um is thinking about\n the log not as\n just a place where things go to die but that the log is is\n something that that's alive and\n can feed back into the application and provide information\n for back into the app not just oh this\n is a thing that i go to figure out when something went\n wrong yeah so so this is it's kind of\n interesting if you if you look at and and again you have to\n be very careful that you don't abstract\n too much because then everything looks the same but if if\n you look at the ui for example right\n what is a ui well i'm sending things into the ui and maybe\n to change the back color of a button or\n to kind of you know make a button um disabled and out of\n the ui come a stream of events like mouse\n clicks and mouse moves and and button clicks and then my my\n code my ui code transforms that stream\n of of ui events into other events that it sends into the ui\n so there's this loop where there's the\n ui and then my kind of event processing and they are kind\n of coupled in a loop\n now if you look at something like locally for example\n there's no difference there because my program sends events\n to lovely and then can query those\n events and then go back so you get the kind of same loop so\n and suddenly a lot of these things\n now look very similar right and because you're observing\n you know like it's like\n when you write ui code it's like you're observing the ui\n and based on what you see you're kind of\n doing something with the ui so you know what is your\n logging system you're observing your running\n code and based on what happens you can kind of you know do\n something you respond to that yes and like\n when you say yes exactly and when you say logging you know\n that goes there to die yeah then why do\n you do it you do the logging to observe the behavior of\n your code such that you can you know\n intercept when something you know unexpected happens or\n yeah and well in a way it's thinking\n about what my relationship is to the application and then\n starting to abstract what i do where where\n i run my app and then i watch the logger and i'm watching\n messages fly by and then i'm like oh that\n wasn't right then i go do something well okay now i can\n start to abstract that thing that i did and\n realize that that stream is data yep and i am the observer\n watching that data\n and then i'm going to react and and i think that's just a\n way to kind of um\n realize what's going on with the reactive yes that's that's\n that's how i just processed it now\n yes and that's exactly right and then what what i'm trying\n to do is that you can automate yourself\n away yeah so you write then now what what the next step i\n would say to you is that now write\n some code that will do what you what i did yeah and then\n and then now you can kind of you know\n create more value for your business because now because\n once you can automate it really you know\n a human doesn't need to be there or one thing that i'm also\n trying to do is that\n there's many things where the data like with with these\n logs for example i think this is a\n nice example there's so much data in the logs but you what\n you have to do is you have to turn\n that into something actionable for humans right and so i\n think that that's one of the things that\n i'm trying to make easy where you can take massive amounts\n of data and then you know use the computer\n to kind of you know munch that such that at some point you\n get something that's useful at the human\n scale right because we cannot deal with millions of events\n per second i mean even nobody can do\n that right because we can maybe deal with like you know one\n event or alert every five minutes\n right so what you want to do is that's kind of you know you\n want to boil down all that data\n into something that's consumable by humans and the rest\n should all be automated uh to take a step back\n a little bit so we talked about how this is a this is a uh\n not to use word protocol but this is a way\n that many different types of platforms and languages can\n interact with each other uh so i'm\n assuming you have to share the this these concepts with\n many different audiences uh you you know a\n microsoft audience who's implementing in dot net a javas\ncript audience who might be running node\n um or or running browser-based applications\n um or a java so i'm just wondering how you share this\n message do you when you go and talk about\n reactor framework do you use microsoft examples of the j\navascript or do you tailor for for what\n they do or for java again okay so this is a very good\n question so what what you always should do is\n that you should kind of you know phrase things in terms\n that are familiar to your target audience\n so if you're talking with javascript people you should use\n you know javascript\n um examples um and so one of the things that i really enjoy\n now being you know on my own is that\n it it's in some sense much easier to kind of you know go\n and and and embed yourself in a different\n community um so and and we i already gave the example of\n netflix that did rx for java right\n and while the the underlying ideas are the same that there\n's very big differences actually in the\n java and c-sharp languages that then affect the the\n concrete design of the api and for example in\n dotnet there's this notion of extension methods where you\n can take any type and you can add\n you know they're not virtual but you can add like instance\n methods to that type independent of the\n type itself so for example if you have array of int i can\n add a new method like conceptually to\n array of and in java you cannot do that java 8 has you know\n virtual extension methods on interfaces\n that are slightly different but so for example the the\n design of rx for java you know has to\n stay within the constraints of java so what i'm trying to\n do when i work with with people that that\n do an rx implementation for their language is to make sure\n that it feels natural for their environment but still\n embodies the same underlying more abstract i would say\n mathematical principles and let me give you\n another example in javascript on array there's already\n functions like map filter and so on so\n when you do rx which is you know the push based version of\n that\n you're not going to call them select and select many you\n call them map and where because you know\n that's natural of course that are natural exactly so that's\n kind of what i'm\n really looking forward to one of the things that i'm really\n looking forward to is to work with all\n these different language communities to make this thing\n kind of feel natural for what they're doing\n and then still being able to interoperate between you know\n machines or between languages\n um where the protocol is kind of you know consistent okay\n but the implementations\n should feel natural so let me give you another example when\n we did the javascript version in the\n beginning in javascript the casing of identifiers is\n opposite\n of c sharp so in c sharp it's like you know two strings\n starts with uppercase i always forget\n whether that's camel or pascal case i always have to do we\n look at that up on wikipedia whereas in\n javascript it's it's different right right so what we did\n in the beginning is we used the\n the dot net naming conventions and then all the javascript\n people would go like\n and then i was like oh man that's bike shedding but then i\n realized no i'm wrong because i find\n it annoying too if if you have to go the other way exactly\n so we changed that and now\n you know then jafar hussein from netflix said oh we should\n change the names too so\n my thinking has evolved very much that now it's like okay\n you do what's natural for the language\n and then um you know make it still conceptually the same\n and then you pass the kind of same test\n so there's there's a whole bunch like i don't know like\n 3000 unit tests\n and that specify the semantics so it's really\n maintaining the semantics across languages but with\n different implementations and and\n i must say it's it's that is the hardest part is that some\n things don't translate so you have to\n which is also nice right like for example what i mentioned\n with the extension method so you\n cannot just take the c sharp um implementation and just\n plug it into a different language so\n you have to really work hard on that to to make it natural\n and to make it possible in a different language\n okay if i'm if i have some pet language and i'm looking at\n i'm very interested in this reactive\n stuff and i want to implement it in in my let's just say\n python let's imagine python doesn't have\n anything and where where would i go to learn about um or or\n talk to people and understand\n what how to implement it what what the the underlying\n principles are\n okay so that that that's that's a very good question so\n there's um there's learn rxrx there's learn rxrx\n dot com so that that's uh one of the dotnet early users\n that has written a book there's also paul\n betts and jesse liberty have written a book a very thin\n book on on rx um which i like because it's\n thin and then there's the rx guidelines that give you a\n little bit more of the semantics okay um and\n and and so i would say you know you start playing with the\n dotnet version or the java version\n um and then you know you you go\n from there the other thing is

          <div class="video-description"><span class="video-description-label">Description:</span> The Reactive Framework (Rx) is a programming model for dealing with asynchronous data streams, specifically in the context of distributed computing. It was developed by Erik Meijer while he was working at Microsoft and has since become an open-source project. Rx provides a set of libraries and tools for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators. It is designed to allow developers to easily build responsive and resilient systems that can handle high volumes of data and handle failures gracefully. Rx is implemented in a number of programming languages, including C#, Java, and JavaScript, and has been widely adopted in the software industry.</div>

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike again with UGtastic. I’m sitting down at GOTO
Chicago with Eric Meyer. Eric Meyer is,
 well if you’ve worked with Microsoft technologies over the
 last decade, you’ve worked with something
 that Eric has created or been a part of, from C# to the
 Azure cloud platform. Now you’re away from
 Microsoft and you’re working a lot more on the open source
 world. Well, first off, thank you for
 sitting down with me, but can you tell me a little bit
 about what this platform that you just spoke
 about, this reactive framework, what is that and what is
 that? Okay, so I can try to explain that
 in general terms because that I think is also where you
 mentioned open source, where the kind of
 the value of open source comes in. So the thing is if you
‘re trying to compose software, in my view,
 there are four different kinds of effects that as a
 developer you have that you have to take
 into account. So let’s look at the simple, you know, when
 you’re doing, when you’re programming
 Java and you’re calling a method, typically the method
 returns one value and that method is actually
 synchronously. So you call, you know, two string and, you
 know, that call blocks and then returns
 a single string. Right. Right. So that’s kind of the
 simplest synchronous call that returns one
 value. So input, wait, output. Yes. Now the second thing
 that what you do is that if you
 make a call, synchronous call, and what you get back is a
 collection of values,
 like an iterable in Java. Right. So you make a call and now
 you get back an iterable, but
 that iterable represents multiple values, but also they are
 synchronous because you, you call next,
 next, next, and each call to next is blocking. Right. Okay.
 But the, the, the, the important
 thing is that there’s two, you know, ways to compose your
 program. One where you have a
 single result and one where you have multiple results. And
 then, you know, when you have
 multiple results, you loop over that and, and so on. But
 those are for, for synchronous programs,
 those are the two kind of main, um, ways to compose your
 program. Now let’s go to the
 asynchronous case because that’s the very important now
 that we’re moving to more kind of, you know,
 distributed world. When you make a call, you don’t want to
 be blocked because there’s like latency,
 errors, whatever, you know, we all know the kind of fall
acies of distributed computing.
 So what you want to do is you want, you want to make these
 calls asynchronous. Right. Now,
 and there’s a lot of, uh, talk these days in JavaScript, in
 many languages about how to deal
 with asynchronous calls. And in my opinion, when you have
 an asynchronous call that returns a single value,
 um, what you do is you return some kind of future or, you
 know, promise or whatever,
 how you want to call it. And then .NET, that is, they use
 the type task for that. So a task
 represents a computation that is asynchronous, that has a
 single result. So you make a call,
 you get back this thing that represents, you know, a
 promise that, you know,
 there will be a value at some point. Um, now what Rx is, is
 that it complements,
 this picture by having, what happens if you have something
 that returns multiple results
 asynchronously. So say you make, um, the most natural
 examples, maybe Twitter, you make a call,
 you send a query to Twitter, and what you get back is a
 stream of all the tweets. Right. And you’re
 not asking, give me the next tweet. No, Twitter will kind
 of, you know, notify you when the next tweet.
 Just pulls up a buffer, kind of.
 Well, it just notifies you with events or something, or
 like your, and even on your local machine, if
 you’re doing, um, events processing, like your mouse moves,
 or so on, you’re not asking the mouse,
 give me the next mouse move. Right. You get notified, so
 you get a sequence of, of collections.
 Sorry. Probably shouldn’t drink, uh, soda. It’s okay. Um,
 now, so, so, so what Rx is, is it, it’s
 trying to kind of, you know, deal with asynchronous comput
ations with streams of data, asynchronous data streams. Okay
.
 And, and, and, and if you look at languages like Erlang,
 they have embraced that, that same paradigm for a long time
, right?
 Where you do message passing, you have two different agents
 that send messages to each other, um, and, and so what
 this is trying to do is to define an interface that you can
 put on, on different services, and then you can glue
 these things together using this interface.
 Okay. Uh, a lot of the examples you gave were in, in .NET.
 Is this a .NET only thing?
 Ah, that’s a very good question.
 So one of the, um, things is that since this is an, an
 abstract interface in the sense of abstract, it’s a concept
ually abstract, there’s no language
 dependency. So we, we, we, um, on the open source side, it
‘s like, you know, rx.codeplex.com.
 Okay.
 Where we open source this. We have versions for JavaScript,
 for .NET, and for C++. The C++ one is not as mature.
 Right.
 Um, then Netflix has written a Java implement.
 It’s a Java implementation. Um, GitHub has written an
 Objective-C implementation, and in Dart, uh, Google has the
 Dart streams library, which is also, um, based on these
 principles.
 Okay.
 And then other people have done, like, Python, and, and
 Ruby, and so there’s, like, you know, again, this idea of
 having asynchronous data streams is not tied at all to a
 single language, and that’s exactly also what I want,
 because you don’t know if you’re on, on the server side,
 use Java, and how to use Java.
 And I, on the client side, use JavaScript, and I still want
 to, kind of, exchange, you know, events with you.
 Right.
 So, um, that’s, I think, very important that, that it’s not
 tied to a particular language.
 Okay. So it’s a little bit more like a protocol?
 It’s a little bit more like, like, like, like a protocol.
 Okay.
 Um, because the, the, the, what we call the Rx grammar, or
 the Rx design guidelines, so if, if you and I are exch
anging messages, um, what the protocol says is, like, what
 is the, you know, how are the messages represented, what is
 the binary format, or what is the kind of, you know, what
 is the state machine that we use?
 So Rx has a very simple state machine like that, so I can
 send you a number of messages that are ordered, and then I
 can terminate that stream successfully, that means you don
‘t get any more.
 I can say something went wrong, and then, you know, so that
‘s really the, the, the, the protocol that, that there is,
 but it, it, it makes certain kind of assumptions, so, but,
 what, what is, you know, I, I’m, I’m not so sure if, if it
‘s really relevant to make a distinction between a protocol
 and an API, because you can also say, if you have an API
 for files, right, you have to, you open your file, you
 write, and you read, and you close the file, that’s kind of
 a protocol, too.
 So, for me, I’m, yeah, I don’t, it’s somewhere in, in
 between, it’s a, well, I, I think, I, I like to emphasize
 what, what is the same instead of what’s different, so
 there are certain ways that you should use, or expectations
 of, in what order you make calls, and, and whether you want
 to call that a protocol or not, I mean, that, I’m fine with
 either way.
 Well, is it kind of like if, if you start to use the word
 protocol, it becomes kind of rust, and it becomes dogmatic.
 Yes.
 And then, then people.
 Because protocol is very formal, and it’s like, everybody
 has to do it exactly this way, and if you don’t do it this
 way, you’re not, you’re not reactive.
 Yes.
 That’s the next thing you’re going to say, this isn’t rust
ful, this isn’t reactive.
 Yes, and, and, and so I’m trying to be very easygoing with
 that, because, for example, you know, if you have an
 existing service, for example, I, I, I’m, in the past weeks
, I’ve implemented a wrapper for Logly, which is a, is a, a
 logging service, so what you can do is you can send it
 values, you know,
 events you know whatever they’re just like fight streams
 and then you can query them later so it’s
 like now what i did is i wrapped that in a reactive you
 know shell right and so the underlying thing
 doesn’t know anything about rx and you know it’s just
 whatever you know the rest api that that the
 locally guys and exposed but now you know by making your
 client library you know talk rx now
 there’s no difference between you know um locally or your
 mouse and so now you can kind of you know
 mesh together you know things that come from locally with
 your mouse or and you can visualize
 it so it allows you to compose so by by making exposing all
 these things with the same interface
 then you can compose them
 but you you don’t force the interface kind of you know all
 the way down so that’s kind of you know
 so you can always it’s like bridging the protocols right
 you can always you know and one of the
 things i think about that’s interesting for as a is more of
 a i i’m a business developer i’m
 going to implement just an implementer um is thinking about
 the log not as
 just a place where things go to die but that the log is is
 something that that’s alive and
 can feed back into the application and provide information
 for back into the app not just oh this
 is a thing that i go to figure out when something went
 wrong yeah so so this is it’s kind of
 interesting if you if you look at and and again you have to
 be very careful that you don’t abstract
 too much because then everything looks the same but if if
 you look at the ui for example right
 what is a ui well i’m sending things into the ui and maybe
 to change the back color of a button or
 to kind of you know make a button um disabled and out of
 the ui come a stream of events like mouse
 clicks and mouse moves and and button clicks and then my my
 code my ui code transforms that stream
 of of ui events into other events that it sends into the ui
 so there’s this loop where there’s the
 ui and then my kind of event processing and they are kind
 of coupled in a loop
 now if you look at something like locally for example
 there’s no difference there because my program sends events
 to lovely and then can query those
 events and then go back so you get the kind of same loop so
 and suddenly a lot of these things
 now look very similar right and because you’re observing
 you know like it’s like
 when you write ui code it’s like you’re observing the ui
 and based on what you see you’re kind of
 doing something with the ui so you know what is your
 logging system you’re observing your running
 code and based on what happens you can kind of you know do
 something you respond to that yes and like
 when you say yes exactly and when you say logging you know
 that goes there to die yeah then why do
 you do it you do the logging to observe the behavior of
 your code such that you can you know
 intercept when something you know unexpected happens or
 yeah and well in a way it’s thinking
 about what my relationship is to the application and then
 starting to abstract what i do where where
 i run my app and then i watch the logger and i’m watching
 messages fly by and then i’m like oh that
 wasn’t right then i go do something well okay now i can
 start to abstract that thing that i did and
 realize that that stream is data yep and i am the observer
 watching that data
 and then i’m going to react and and i think that’s just a
 way to kind of um
 realize what’s going on with the reactive yes that’s that’s
 that’s how i just processed it now
 yes and that’s exactly right and then what what i’m trying
 to do is that you can automate yourself
 away yeah so you write then now what what the next step i
 would say to you is that now write
 some code that will do what you what i did yeah and then
 and then now you can kind of you know
 create more value for your business because now because
 once you can automate it really you know
 a human doesn’t need to be there or one thing that i’m also
 trying to do is that
 there’s many things where the data like with with these
 logs for example i think this is a
 nice example there’s so much data in the logs but you what
 you have to do is you have to turn
 that into something actionable for humans right and so i
 think that that’s one of the things that
 i’m trying to make easy where you can take massive amounts
 of data and then you know use the computer
 to kind of you know munch that such that at some point you
 get something that’s useful at the human
 scale right because we cannot deal with millions of events
 per second i mean even nobody can do
 that right because we can maybe deal with like you know one
 event or alert every five minutes
 right so what you want to do is that’s kind of you know you
 want to boil down all that data
 into something that’s consumable by humans and the rest
 should all be automated uh to take a step back
 a little bit so we talked about how this is a this is a uh
 not to use word protocol but this is a way
 that many different types of platforms and languages can
 interact with each other uh so i’m
 assuming you have to share the this these concepts with
 many different audiences uh you you know a
 microsoft audience who’s implementing in dot net a javas
cript audience who might be running node
 um or or running browser-based applications
 um or a java so i’m just wondering how you share this
 message do you when you go and talk about
 reactor framework do you use microsoft examples of the j
avascript or do you tailor for for what
 they do or for java again okay so this is a very good
 question so what what you always should do is
 that you should kind of you know phrase things in terms
 that are familiar to your target audience
 so if you’re talking with javascript people you should use
 you know javascript
 um examples um and so one of the things that i really enjoy
 now being you know on my own is that
 it it’s in some sense much easier to kind of you know go
 and and and embed yourself in a different
 community um so and and we i already gave the example of
 netflix that did rx for java right
 and while the the underlying ideas are the same that there
‘s very big differences actually in the
 java and c-sharp languages that then affect the the
 concrete design of the api and for example in
 dotnet there’s this notion of extension methods where you
 can take any type and you can add
 you know they’re not virtual but you can add like instance
 methods to that type independent of the
 type itself so for example if you have array of int i can
 add a new method like conceptually to
 array of and in java you cannot do that java 8 has you know
 virtual extension methods on interfaces
 that are slightly different but so for example the the
 design of rx for java you know has to
 stay within the constraints of java so what i’m trying to
 do when i work with with people that that
 do an rx implementation for their language is to make sure
 that it feels natural for their environment but still
 embodies the same underlying more abstract i would say
 mathematical principles and let me give you
 another example in javascript on array there’s already
 functions like map filter and so on so
 when you do rx which is you know the push based version of
 that
 you’re not going to call them select and select many you
 call them map and where because you know
 that’s natural of course that are natural exactly so that’s
 kind of what i’m
 really looking forward to one of the things that i’m really
 looking forward to is to work with all
 these different language communities to make this thing
 kind of feel natural for what they’re doing
 and then still being able to interoperate between you know
 machines or between languages
 um where the protocol is kind of you know consistent okay
 but the implementations
 should feel natural so let me give you another example when
 we did the javascript version in the
 beginning in javascript the casing of identifiers is
 opposite
 of c sharp so in c sharp it’s like you know two strings
 starts with uppercase i always forget
 whether that’s camel or pascal case i always have to do we
 look at that up on wikipedia whereas in
 javascript it’s it’s different right right so what we did
 in the beginning is we used the
 the dot net naming conventions and then all the javascript
 people would go like
 and then i was like oh man that’s bike shedding but then i
 realized no i’m wrong because i find
 it annoying too if if you have to go the other way exactly
 so we changed that and now
 you know then jafar hussein from netflix said oh we should
 change the names too so
 my thinking has evolved very much that now it’s like okay
 you do what’s natural for the language
 and then um you know make it still conceptually the same
 and then you pass the kind of same test
 so there’s there’s a whole bunch like i don’t know like
 3000 unit tests
 and that specify the semantics so it’s really
 maintaining the semantics across languages but with
 different implementations and and
 i must say it’s it’s that is the hardest part is that some
 things don’t translate so you have to
 which is also nice right like for example what i mentioned
 with the extension method so you
 cannot just take the c sharp um implementation and just
 plug it into a different language so
 you have to really work hard on that to to make it natural
 and to make it possible in a different language
 okay if i’m if i have some pet language and i’m looking at
 i’m very interested in this reactive
 stuff and i want to implement it in in my let’s just say
 python let’s imagine python doesn’t have
 anything and where where would i go to learn about um or or
 talk to people and understand
 what how to implement it what what the the underlying
 principles are
 okay so that that that’s that’s a very good question so
 there’s um there’s learn rxrx there’s learn rxrx
 dot com so that that’s uh one of the dotnet early users
 that has written a book there’s also paul
 betts and jesse liberty have written a book a very thin
 book on on rx um which i like because it’s
 thin and then there’s the rx guidelines that give you a
 little bit more of the semantics okay um and
 and and so i would say you know you start playing with the
 dotnet version or the java version
 um and then you know you you go
 from there the other thing is that in some sense the javas
cript version that we have
 um for dotnet is a little bit like a reference
 implementation because javascript doesn’t have
 threading and and so so in many cases the the
 implementation there is simpler than the dotnet
 version which is highly also highly optimized it’s very
 mature code it’s like you know so because
 it’s it’s written for you know for performance rather than
 clarity you know looking at that code
 may not help you that much okay so but the common reference
 seems to be javascript yeah so javascript
 is probably the kind of thing that that’s the most approach
able okay and then the concepts are not
 that difficult i mean that’s the things like well i think
 you have to be careful that you know i talk
 a lot about duality and category theory which might you
 know scare people off but this has
 nothing to do in some sense with that that’s one way to
 explain it another way to to explain it is
 say you’re a javascript programmer right javascript already
 has a notion of events
 everything in javascript is event based right now one way
 to look at rx is to say well but
 events in javascript are not something that are first class
 so i cannot have an array of events
 or i cannot have a function that returns an event right
 right just it’s a byproduct
 of the environment exactly and i think yes and what rx
 gives you is it makes events into things
 that you can manipulate and and pass around so it’s one way
 to that rx is sometimes also called
 it’s like first class events so in that sense you know it’s
 very familiar to javascript programmers
 because it it takes these concepts that they already know
 and another concept that they already
 know like arrays arrays are first class things i can have a
 function that takes an array i can have
 an array and now you you allow the same for events and the
 power of that is that you can now decouple
 the source of the event say a button that fires events from
 the events itself so for example i can
 now create an array that has the values and then make that
 into an event source for example to test
 so i don’t have to have a button that fires the events but
 i just put the values in an array and
 say to event and now that thing serves as an event source
 and so that’s the kind of trick so it’s really conceptually
 not that hard um but then of course
 the subtlety is once you make that first class you have to
 kind of be careful because of the
 asynchrony okay well thank you very much for taking the
 time to stay with me i really appreciate it
 yes and you know i would say try it out and if you yeah we
‘re always happy to accept you know
 contributions yeah and you said it’s on codeplex it’s on
 codeplex and and the netflix version is on
 github and that’s uh java rx on github the netflix side
 okay and learn rx is is the place yes yes and
 so i i i you know you will probably put those yeah those
 links will be in there okay perfect
 thank you thank you thank you so much okay that’s my edit

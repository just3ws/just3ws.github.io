<p> If you're a senior developer working with colleagues just a few years junior to you, you already have everything you need to be a mentor. It doesn’t take years of preparation or a formal program to begin—it starts with curiosity and conversation.   </p>

<p> Ask about their setup:   </p>

<ul> <li> <em>"Which fonts do you use in your editor?"</em>  </li> <li> <em>"Oh, you use X IDE? How do you like that workflow?"</em>  </li> <li> <em>"I noticed you use X technique for this task. That’s cool—here’s how I approach it with Y. I like what you did with X—maybe I can integrate that into my process."</em>  </li> </ul>

<p> These small exchanges are the first steps towards mentorship. When you open the door by being curious and genuinely interested in how someone works, you show respect for their ideas. You also set the stage for mutual learning—mentorship isn’t a one-way street.   </p>

<p> When you engage this way, you build confidence:   </p>

<ul> <li> You’re implicitly saying, <em>“What you do matters.”</em>  </li> <li> Recognizing their strengths helps junior developers feel valued.  </li> </ul>

<p> And mentorship is a learning opportunity for you, too. Junior developers often bring fresh ideas or approaches you might not have considered. By being curious, you might discover something new or see a challenge from a different perspective.   </p>

<p> Mentorship also makes collaboration easier. When people feel heard and supported, they’re more likely to share ideas and ask for help. A team where everyone feels valued—regardless of experience—works more cohesively.   </p>

<p> Start small:   </p>

<ul> <li> Invite someone to pair program.  </li> <li> Ask for their opinion during a code review and explain why you value it.  </li> <li> Share a small trick you’ve picked up, and ask if they have one to share.  </li> </ul>

<p> These conversations build trust and open the door for deeper collaboration.   </p>

<p> Mentorship doesn’t have to be formal or intimidating. It begins with respect, curiosity, and a willingness to learn from each other.   </p>

<p> So go ahead: ask about their fonts. Ask about their techniques. Watch how these simple conversations transform your relationships, your team, and even your own perspective on growth.   </p>

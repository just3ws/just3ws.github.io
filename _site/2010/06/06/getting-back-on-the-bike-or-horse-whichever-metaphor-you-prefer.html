<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Been a while since I’ve last blogged. Things have changed a bit for me as well, my personal life was in a bit of turmoil for the past few months that I won’t go into right now. Suffice to say, they were simply matters of life and not caused by “drama”. I’m going to resume regular blogging and trying to get some decent content out of my system. Not that the content I created till now was all that decent, but better to have something than nothing. And even if my content is more useful as a warning to others than so be it.</p>
<p>What’s changed for me professionally since we last spoke? Glad you asked. I own a Mac.</p>
<p>Yes, let that last sentence breath in. Swirl it around in your mouth. Did you catch the flavor. I own a Mac. If we’ve ever spoken before then you may know that I have held a critical opinion of Macs and their culture for quite some time. I wasn’t against Macs because I thought Windows PC’s were superior or that they were bad systems in and of themselves. I just didn’t appreciate some of what I thought was the culture surrounding them. And I thought they were seriously over-priced. Still do to an extent. But I bought one anyway, and for a good reason in my opinion. Ruby development is just better on a Mac.<a href="https://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-06-06/tCEJrFztkmadobvzyuFEAcGJnJwxBnxfggceCCrkCAEitusACmHbkrrpizBo/the_golden_cage_sauermann.jpg.scaled1000.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100907070236im_/http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-06-06/tCEJrFztkmadobvzyuFEAcGJnJwxBnxfggceCCrkCAEitusACmHbkrrpizBo/the_golden_cage_sauermann.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" height="687" alt="The Golden Cage illustration" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a> </p>
<p>“Why do you care about Ruby development there Mike?”, you may be asking yourself, “You’re a .NET guy.” Yes, you are correct. I’ve been a .NET developer since it popped up on the scene nearly a decade ago now. And I’ve pretty much been focused on the one platform for that time as well. But things need to change or they get stale. And this is something I’ve wanted for quite a while now. I never wanted to be pigeon-holed as a single platform developer. But it’s something like the Golden Cage. You get so caught up in the fact that you’re surrounded by gold that you forget you’re in a cage. .NET has been very good to me and my career. It’s given me a broad and deep platform to spread out and grow within, but no matter how big the cage is this bird’s gotta fly free. I harbor no ill-will towards Microsoft, it’s employees or the developers who choose to work with it’s tools and languages. I just need to take a leap and work on something completely different for a while.</p>
<p>So, that’s that. Major life altering events and a new direction in my career.</p>

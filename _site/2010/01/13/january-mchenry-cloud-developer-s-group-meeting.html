<p>first, I’d like to point out an intentional wording of the group’s name “Developer’s”. The apostrophe means that this isn’t a group of developers but a group owned by developers. In that you are the purpose of and for the groups existence. And you can decide it’s destiny and direction. Right now we’re a cloud oriented group, and there is no shortage of things to talk about and learn from that topic. But that doesn’t mean that if we want to talk about a different topic that we can’t. It’s your group to own, your group to share with and most importantly your group to participate in.</p>
<p>January’s meeting was a lot of fun. A small but focused group allowed for an informal more conversational presentation on the Google App Engine. We met at the Panera’s in Crystal Lake. Which in my opinion was a more relaxed, fun place to meet than the library. For only $25 in baked goods we had the large, private room for two hours, places to plug in our laptops and the large monitor I used for the presentation and free, albeit flaky, wi-fi. So, if no one has a problem with that I’d like to hold our meetings there until we can find a better host. </p>
<p>And speaking of hosts, projectors and such. If anyone would like to help out with managing the website and up dates, etc. Let me know and I’ll set you up with access and work out what we’d like to do going forward. Among the many things I owe the group to really get it going is a charter and a plan to maintain and grow the group. Help me do that, please.</p>
<p>Thansk, and looking forward to next month where we’l be learning about Azure from a Microsoft representative!</p>

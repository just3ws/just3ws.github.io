<p>37 posts in 31 days!</p>
<p>I’m finally at the end of my month long challenge to blog everyday. I had lofty goals of writing insightful and info laden posts but given the aggresive schedule of a post a day and the demands of life and other commitments, I was just happy to get a paragraph or two written by the end of the day. Wow, that was quite a bit more work than I anticipated. But I’m really happy.</p>
<p>My blog reached over 1600 unique views across the thirty odd posts I made. Which, in some circumstances that wouldn’t be very impressive. But in perspective that’s the most traffic I’ve seen in ever.</p>
<p>All I can hope is that some people found some humor or information in my postings. And I am not going to open my mouth for this kind of exercise again, for at least a little while. :)</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who did visit. I’ll be concentrating on writing more solid articles with more focused content over the coming weeks. Please stay tuned, as I will be writing about IronRuby and using alternative platform tools to support development on the .NET platform. Also, I’ve toyed around with screencasting, so I may be throwing my hat into that arena as well.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

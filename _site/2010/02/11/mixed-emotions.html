Sitting on the floor of our kitchen. Eating my wife’s “Hippy cakes.” Daughter bopping around banging kitchen utensils as classical piano music also plays in the background. The house is a disaster. We’re exhausted and my wife’s mother has been laid to rest. The two year war is over and we lost. Exhaustion mixed with a sideways sense of relief. It’s over and we can never change that. All we have are the survivors. Cliche but so is life.</p>

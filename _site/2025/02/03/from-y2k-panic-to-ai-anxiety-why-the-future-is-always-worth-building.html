<h3> 1999: The World Braced for Collapse—But I Was Planning My Escape  </h3>

<p> In <strong>December 1999</strong>, the world was fixated on <strong>Y2K</strong>. People feared that at the stroke of midnight, technology would fail—planes would fall from the sky, banks would lose all records, and the digital age would come crashing down.  </p>

<p> But I wasn’t worried about Y2K. <strong>I was planning my own escape.</strong>  </p>

<p> I was working at my <strong>father’s shop</strong>—unpaid, surviving on food and shelter, having to justify every dollar I asked for. My first real attempt at an IT career—a <strong>warehouse contract job assembling computers</strong>—had come and gone. I was <strong>back where I started, with no money and no path forward.</strong>  </p>

<p> By the time Y2K hit, I wasn’t bracing for disaster. I was making my move.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> Betting on the Future (Even When It’s Uncertain)  </h3>

<p> I found an early <strong>CareerBuilder</strong> job posting for a <strong>PC/Network Technician</strong> at <strong>C.H. Robinson</strong>. <strong>I didn’t meet all the requirements</strong>, but I had:  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Hands-on IT experience</strong> from my short-lived contract job.  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Freight forwarding knowledge</strong> from working for my father.  </p>

<p> C.H. Robinson was a <strong>freight company</strong>, so I made my case:  </p>

<blockquote> <strong>“I know the industry, and I know computers. I can learn the rest.”</strong>  </blockquote>

<p> That was enough. I got the job.  </p>

<p> But taking the job <strong>came at a cost.</strong>  </p>

<p> When I told my <strong>mother</strong> about the <strong>$42,000 salary</strong>, she <strong>immediately told me to take it</strong>—she would <strong>handle my father</strong>. But when I told him, his response was simple:  </p>

<blockquote> <strong>“You will come crawling back.”</strong>  </blockquote>

<p> He <strong>kicked me out</strong>, gave me a <strong>deadline to leave</strong>, and we didn’t talk for years.  </p>

<p> I never crawled back. But I did return—<strong>on my terms</strong>, standing alongside my then-girlfriend <strong>Aneta</strong>, who would become my wife and my greatest supporter.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> 2025: The Future is Still Coming, and Fear Won’t Stop It  </h3>

<p> Today, people fear <strong>AI</strong> the way they feared <strong>Y2K</strong>.  </p>

<ul> <li> “It’s going to take all the jobs.” </li> <li> “We’re losing control of technology.” </li> <li> “We need to stop it before it’s too late.” </li> </ul>

<p> I understand the anxiety. But <strong>I feel the same way now that I did then</strong>:  </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>There is no going back.</strong>   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>Staying in place is not an option.</strong>   </p>

<p> ✅ <strong>The only way forward is through.</strong>  </p>

<p> The lesson I learned in <strong>1999</strong> is the same one I carry in <strong>2025</strong>: <strong>The future is always uncertain, but it’s still worth building.</strong>  </p>

<p> Y2K didn’t end the world. AI won’t end the world either.  </p>

<p> What we do <strong>right now</strong>—how we <strong>adapt, learn, and build</strong>—is what matters.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> What’s Your Y2K Moment?  </h3>

<p> Have you ever faced <strong>a moment where everything felt uncertain, but you knew you had to move forward anyway?</strong>  </p>

<p> Drop a comment—I’d love to hear your story. 🚀  </p>

<p> For most of my career, I’ve eschewed titles. I saw people chase them like prizes—coveting authority without earning respect, collecting accolades without delivering results. I didn’t want to be like that. I thought my work should speak for itself, that my results would be my title.  </p>

<p> But that was my mistake.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> What I Misunderstood About Titles  </h3>

<p> I thought rejecting titles meant rejecting ego, politics, and posturing. What I didn’t realize was that titles aren’t just symbols of power—they’re tools of utility. They’re shorthand for your role, your value, and your expertise in a world where time is scarce and perceptions matter.  </p>

<p> Here’s what I misunderstood:  </p>

<ol> <li> <strong>Titles Shape Perception</strong> A title can mean the difference between being invited to the table or left outside the room. It doesn’t matter if you’re the most qualified person in the building—if your role doesn’t reflect that, people won’t know to include you. </li> <li> <strong>Titles Signal Authority</strong> Titles grant weight to your voice. Without them, even your best ideas can be dismissed or overlooked—not because they lack merit, but because people instinctively defer to perceived authority. </li> <li> <strong>Titles Protect Your Work</strong> A title isn’t just about status; it’s about accountability. When your role is clearly defined and respected, it’s harder for others to co-opt your contributions or sideline your expertise. </li> </ol>

<hr>

<h3> Why I Avoided Titles  </h3>

<p> I avoided titles because of what I’d seen them represent:  </p>

<ul> <li> People chasing promotions for the sake of appearances. </li> <li> Colleagues using their titles as shields to deflect accountability. </li> <li> Leaders wielding authority without the competence to back it up. </li> </ul>

<p> To me, titles seemed like distractions from what really mattered: the work. But I failed to see the bigger picture.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> What I’ve Learned About Utility  </h3>

<p> Titles aren’t inherently good or bad—it’s what you do with them that matters. For someone like me, who values integrity, collaboration, and results, a title isn’t about ego. It’s about utility. It’s about:  </p>

<ul> <li><strong>Making your contributions visible.</strong></li> <li><strong>Amplifying your voice.</strong></li> <li><strong>Ensuring your seat at the table.</strong></li> </ul>

<p> A title is a tool—not a prize. And in rejecting it, I gave others tools to define me, to speak over me, and to take credit for work they didn’t do.  </p>

<hr>

<h3> Moving Forward  </h3>

<p> I still don’t covet titles. But I no longer reject them outright. I recognize their utility—not as symbols of status, but as tools for impact. Titles aren’t about what they mean to <em>me</em>; they’re about what they signal to others. They’re a key to opening doors, shaping conversations, and protecting the value I bring to the table.  </p>

<p> So no, I don’t want your job. But I do want the recognition and respect that come with doing it well. Titles can help me achieve that—not for vanity, but for fairness. That’s not a mistake I’ll make again.  </p>

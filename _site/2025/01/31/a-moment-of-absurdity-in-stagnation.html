<p> In the early 2000s, before .NET had solidified and JavaScript was still dismissed as a “toy language,” I worked at a small firm developing <strong>kiosk-based HR systems</strong>. The company was a skeleton crew—just the owner, a senior developer with a long corporate background, a part-time contractor, and me. The entire technology stack was <strong>VBScript, ASP, ActiveX, and IE6</strong>, dictated by a belief that <strong>staying deeply embedded in Microsoft’s ecosystem was the only “serious” way forward.</strong>  </p>

<p> One of my projects was an <strong>on-screen keyboard generator</strong>. The initial version in <strong>VBScript</strong> was bulky and slow, so I rewrote it in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, dramatically improving speed and maintainability. The next day, I was written up. Not because the solution didn’t work—it did—but because <strong>I had violated an unspoken rule</strong>. JavaScript was forbidden. It was, according to the senior developer, a “toy language,” and more people knew VBScript anyway.  </p>

<p> I sat across from him in the owner’s <strong>empty office</strong>, as he placed the write-up on the desk in front of me, taking the owner’s chair as if staging a corporate tribunal. The absurdity of the moment hit me then—<strong>he had no one but me and a part-time contractor to rely on. He depended on me entirely.</strong> Yet, here we were, engaged in a theater of control over something as trivial as which scripting language was used to accomplish the task.  </p>

<p> This pattern repeated when <strong>.NET</strong> entered the conversation. I suggested we explore it. The contractor agreed. But the senior developer shot it down without discussion. When the company’s <strong>one major client fell through</strong>, a potential buyout followed—only to collapse once the buyer realized the technology stack was already obsolete.  </p>

<p> The company folded soon after.  </p>

<p> In retrospect, that moment in the <strong>empty office</strong> encapsulated the entire downfall. A leader so preoccupied with controlling the present that he was blind to the future. So certain of his authority that he refused to see <strong>the walls closing in around him</strong>.  </p>

<p> I walked away from that experience with a simple lesson: <strong>sometimes, the greatest risk isn’t change—it’s refusing to change.</strong>  </p>

<p> We’ve all heard the phrase, “Practice makes perfect.” But does it? Not really.  </p>

<p> Practice doesn’t make perfect. It makes you <em>better</em>. But only if you’re doing it right.  </p>

<p> Here’s the thing: <strong>practice</strong> and <strong>repetition</strong> are not the same. Repetition—mindlessly doing the same thing over and over—will only make you better at doing that one specific thing, flaws and all. Practice, on the other hand, is intentional. It involves analyzing, experimenting, reflecting, and improving as you go.  </p>

<p> <strong>Think about it this way:</strong>  </p>

<ul> <li> Repetition is attempting the same skateboard trick in place, never adjusting your approach. </li> <li> Practice is trying that trick on a winding skate park path—learning, falling, and progressing toward landing it. </li> </ul>

<h3> Why Practice Matters  </h3>

<p> Practice is like paying into the “mortgage” of your skills. Every session is an investment in future returns. Sometimes the return is huge, and you see massive improvement. Other times, it’s smaller—a fractional gain. But here’s the kicker: you <em>always</em> get something. Even if the return is just the knowledge that you weren’t meant to pursue that skill long-term, you’ve learned something valuable.  </p>

<p> When I was reteaching myself skateboarding in my 40s, I had to accept the limits in my practice. I had to adjust my expectations so I could work through significant challenges and fears. Before each trick, I would repeat to myself, “All that matters is the rideaway.” Pushing through the fear of falling or failing, I focused on following through—on finishing the trick, no matter the outcome. What I was really practicing wasn’t just the trick—it was <strong>commitment</strong>.  </p>

<p> I even wrote it on my griptape as a psychological reminder every time I looked down at my board before a run at the curb, an obstacle, or dropping in on a ramp. All that mattered was the rideaway—and that required commitment.  </p>

<h3> Embrace Imperfection  </h3>

<p> We live in a world obsessed with perfection. But here’s the truth: the perfect product, system, or performance doesn’t exist. What does exist is the willingness to create something, no matter how “crappy” it seems at first. That’s where growth happens.  </p>

<p> Some of the most successful companies and systems in the world started as messy, flawed experiments. I’ve seen it firsthand: imperfect products being used by real customers, while the “perfect” systems remain stuck in development.  </p>

<p> The lesson? <em>Execution beats perfection.</em> The willingness to act—to create, learn, and refine—is what drives real progress.  </p>

<h3> What About You?  </h3>

<ul> <li> Are you practicing with intention or just repeating? </li> <li> How do you balance imperfection with progress? </li> </ul>

<p> I’d love to hear your thoughts. Share your experiences in the comments—let’s start a conversation about how we can grow smarter, not just harder.  </p>

<p>The only way to improve your writing skills is to write.  And read.  And stop every now and then to think.  Oh, and having something to write about helps too.  I think that’s the hardest part.  If you have the urge to write something but don’t have anything to say there’s always <a href="https://www.twitter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. The nice thing about the service is that it doesn’t allow you to get fancy.  You are even limited to 140 characters per “tweat”.  If anything I think it’s an exercise in conciseness, saying as much as possible with as little as possible.  Although, I have noticed allot of OMGWTFBBQFTW’ing abuse going on there.  Another thing I like is how the services encourages you to be totally spontaneous.  It’s intended to be a stream of conciousness type of service, they even allow you to SMS your tweats from your mobile.  That’s very cool. Although, I don’t know if I’ll ‘get’ the follow-your-friend system, which doesn’t seem much more interesting than subscribing to someones extremely terse RSS-feed about how much ennui they are currently experiencing.  The only bad thing, and it’s not a reflection of the service is that my current employer blocks the twitter.com domain, so it’s hard to really get used to tweating when you aren’t able to do it for the bulk of the time you’re infront of a terminal.  If you’re interested we can trade invitations, find me at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/just3ws" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Just3Ws</a>. </p>

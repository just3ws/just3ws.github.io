<p>Well, we’re finally underway! And a good start it is. We started the<br>
meeting off with a short introduction to the group and some ideas on<br>
what direction we could take the group. Afterward we discussed some of<br>
the topics we’d like to see at the meetings and even got volunteers<br>
for the next three meetings!</p>
<p>First things first! All people are welcome. This is a no-pressure<br>
group. You do not have to feel like you have to present or even talk<br>
at the meetings. Come, hang out and soak up the info!</p>
<p>Audience: Software developers and anyone interested in learning more<br>
about the various cloud platforms and related technologies.</p>
<p>Group Goal: Share information on the various cloud platforms and<br>
related technologies. Collaborate on group projects that provide<br>
opportunities to develop concrete experience with cloud technologies.<br>
Treat members with respect and an open-minded attitude to sharing what<br>
we learn.</p>
<p>Meeting Schedule: Second Monday of the month.</p>

</ul>
<p>Meeting Format: Typically meetings will follow a traditional Intro-<br>
Presentation-Discussion format. But we’ll also have workshop meetings<br>
where everyone is encouraged to bring their laptop and<br>
collaborate on some code.</p>
<p>Topics: We are open to any topic as long as it relates to supporting<br>
development against a cloud platform. We could have a meeting on<br>
anything from learning Django and Python for AppEngine to Parsing the<br>
Platform Pricing Structures. All topics will be considered!</p>
<p>Online Presence: We have accounts on Google Groups, GitHub, Eventbrite<br>
and Twitter. We even have our own domain and website:<br>
http://www.clouddevelopersgroup.com so we shouldn’t be hard to find.</p>
<p>Organizers: Mike Hall is the group organizer and the point of contact<br>
for all things group related. If you’d like to propose a topic,<br>
volunteer to help out with the meetings or have any questions about<br>
the group you can contact him directly at<br>
mhall@clouddevelopersgroup.com.</p>
<p>Get Involved!: Volunteer, Sponsor, Speak, Ideas! We would like to find<br>
a permanent home for the group, ideally a location with a meeting<br>
room, wireless internet access and a projector. If you would like to<br>
donate food, drinks or equipment to the group please contact Mike Hall<br>
at mhall@clouddevelopersgroup.com.</p>
<p>I’m very excited about the future of this group! 2010 is going to be a<br>
fun year!</p>

<p>Okay, this was a pain in the tuckus.</p>
<p>Not sure which service pack hosed me but I lost a couple hours trying to figure out why I wasn’t able to connect from my Virtual Server host into one of my guest OS’s. I thought maybe there was a problem with connecting to a guest directly from the host, but nope. It was a service pack problem.</p>
<p>Simply put, if you are trying to connect via RDP/MSTSC to another computer and are receiving the following error:</p>
<p><code>The RDP Protocol Component "DATA ENCRYPTION" Detected an Error</code></p>
<p>Follow the instructions here and you’ll be all good. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/323497" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KB 323497 “The RDP Protocol Component “DATA ENCRYPTION” Detected an Error…” error message</a>.</p>

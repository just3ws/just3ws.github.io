  <p>Owned lane-level architecture for the Acquisitions platform, spanning customer application flows, partner integrations, and a large legacy application estate in a regulated financial environment. Operated as a senior individual contributor accountable for architectural integrity, production stability, and cross-team execution, with authority established through incident leadership, deep system knowledge, and cross-team trust. Focused on making system behavior observable and understandable across teams to enable data-driven decisions, reduce systemic risk, and support reliable change in long-lived systems.</p>
  

  
  <ul>
    
    <li>Acted as the final escalation point for high-severity production incidents, taking ownership of live diagnosis during large cross-functional calls, coordinating investigation across teams, establishing a shared understanding of system behavior, and driving concrete action plans with clear follow-up ownership.</li>
    
    <li>Transformed incident response into institutional learning by ensuring every major failure resulted in improved monitoring, clarified ownership, updated documentation, refined operational processes, and corrected cross-team touchpoints across systems with decades of accumulated history.</li>
    
    <li>Reconstructed end-to-end customer acquisition flows by mapping execution context from the customer’s browser through application layers, enterprise service middleware, and downstream business systems, creating an authoritative operational model to ground incident response, risk review, and change planning in observed reality.</li>
    
    <li>Designed and delivered a re-architecture of session state handling across complex, multi-step user workflows, eliminating a persistent integrity failure mode that impaired customer tracking, diagnosis, and incident recovery under real production conditions.</li>
    
    <li>Founded and led the OpenTelemetry Working Group, establishing shared observability standards and training engineering and cybersecurity teams to reason about system behavior using common telemetry; transitioned ownership once practices were institutionalized and adoption became self-sustaining.</li>
    
    <li>Led platform modernization and lifecycle remediation under continuous production load, maintaining regulatory compliance while reducing operational risk and restoring the ability to safely evolve legacy systems.</li>
    
    <li>Re-architected fragmented engineering ownership into a single accountable operating model, clarifying architectural responsibility and escalation paths as a necessary consequence of observed production realities.</li>
    
    <li>Founded an enablement function to isolate cross-cutting platform, risk, and remediation work from feature delivery, enabling sustained progress on long-horizon stability initiatives without disrupting customer-facing teams.</li>
    
    <li>Surfaced and led remediation of systemic integrity risks in high-volume financial workflows, improving transaction reliability and reducing enterprise risk.</li>

  <p>Contributed to platform modernization efforts during a period of organizational transition and acquisition. Designed and implemented new API layers to safely expose internal capabilities, while working with the Customer Funnel team to evaluate and de-risk a planned rewrite of a large legacy system. Identified fundamental data and system knowledge gaps that informed a shift toward incremental modernization rather than wholesale replacement.</p>
  

  
  <ul>
    
    <li>Designed and built an API Gateway to expose selected internal services through well-defined, secure interfaces, enabling controlled integration with internal and external consumers.</li>
    
    <li>Evaluated the feasibility of a full rewrite of a legacy customer-facing system and demonstrated that unclear data lineage and billions of existing records made a big-bang migration impractical and high risk.</li>
    
    <li>Proposed and validated an incremental modernization strategy in which a new API layer operated alongside the legacy system, allowing new features to be developed independently while legacy functionality was migrated selectively.</li>
    
    <li>Designed a two-tier frontend architecture that separated user experience iteration from backend system constraints, reducing regression risk while enabling faster experimentation without destabilizing core systems.</li>
    
    <li>Modernized critical integration points by wrapping legacy functionality in Rails APIs, extending the useful life of the existing platform while enabling gradual transition to newer components.</li>
    
    <li>Reduced operational and maintenance risk by introducing code quality and security tooling, improving visibility into system health and failure modes.</li>
    
  </ul>
  

  
  <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Platform Architecture, API Gateway Design, Legacy System Modernization, Incremental Migration Strategies, Secure API Design, Data Migration Strategy, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, React, Redis, CI/CD and Code Quality Tooling</p>

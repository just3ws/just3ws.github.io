    It's been little under two years since I'd written the "<a href="https://just3ws.posterous.com/getting-back-on-the-bike-or-horse-whichever-m" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Getting back on the bike</a>" post a lot has changed for me. I've been working with Obtiva, now Groupon. Learned me some Ruby, Clojure, JavaScript and VIM. Been running a user-group, mentored some people and been mentored by even more. Paired a lot and spent a lot of time thinking. I've also had a second child and lost both my parents and my mother-in-law to cancer, my father-in-law has taken it very hard so him as well in a sense. My wife and I are together stronger than ever and I believe I can survive more than I ever would have imagined. It's been hard and a horrible storm at times. But it's no good to dwell too long on the lost. My family and I are alive and whole and we persevere.<br>
<br>
I'll be writing up some of the work I am doing towards reaching out to users' groups and helping to bring attention to all the communities in the good ol' US of A, and then eventually the world. I think UGl.st will be helpful. Also UGtastic, a video/interview blog where I sit down and briefly interview the people who facilitate the software developer communities outside the working day.

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at RailsConf 2014.
 I’m standing here with
 Obi Fernandez who led a panel on the future of Rails jobs.
 Thank you for
 taking the time to speak with me. Your panel, what do you
 mean by the
 future of Rails jobs and who was on the panel? Oh, sure.
 Well, Alan Grant, the
 co-founder of Hired, was one of the sponsors, sponsored the
 panel. Okay. He’s
 a friend of mine and we talked about what we could
 contribute to the
 conference and it seemed like a good idea, you know, given
 the amount of people
 that certainly would be here looking for jobs or looking to
 hire people, to have a
 discussion, you know, kind of a frank discussion about what
 is the future of
 our industry, you know, of our job market.
 And where’s it going? So, in addition to Alan, I invited
 Jeff Casimir, who has been
 involved in a lot of training initiatives and his latest
 thing is Turing
 School. Turing School? Yeah. He’s a J3 on Twitter? Yeah. I
 invited Corey Haynes, who’s like
 legendary and, you know, helps to train people in software
 craftsmanship all
 around the world. The Global Day of Code Retreat. Yeah,
 Code Retreat. I thought he would be a useful
 addition given how much talk there’s been about TDD and
 stuff like that. And, you know, he
 also trains up a lot of people and he’s CTO of a local
 company in Chicago. And Chad
 Pytel, who’s a friend and fellow author in the Addison-Wes
ley ProRuby series. He
 runs SoftBot and hired people and does apprenticeships. So,
 yeah, he’s a really good friend and fellow author in the
 Addison-Wesley ProRuby series. He runs SoftBot and hired
 people and does
 apprenticeships. So, I thought between, you know, the bunch
, we would have
 some good perspectives on where this market’s going. And
 you also have a
 history with the Railsway book series. Yeah, yeah. I’m
 editor of the Addison-Wesley ProRuby
 series. My latest book, The Rails Four Way, is coming out
 in print in a couple of
 weeks it’s uh out as a beta book on lean pub okay um you
 know so i mean that’s that’s that’s a lot
 of people who’ve been involved with the with the ruby and
 rails yeah definitely and i had you know
 i used to i used to own hash rocket uh sold it a few years
 ago but there you know we had 35 people
 plus yeah and then in chicago yeah miami exactly yeah jack
sonville so so a lot of a lot of
 experience hiring um and and you know most of us are old-
timers in the the ruby and rails world so
 um you know as we’re coming up on nine ten years like it’s
 a good time to look and see okay where
 we at and that was one of the big topics so what were some
 of the the uh um lessons or what were
 kind of materialized during the panel um it was it was
 interesting to hear um the panelists
 talk about
 where um where they see the most expansion and that would
 of course be kind of like on the junior
 end right there’s a lot of folks pouring into these
 training programs uh there’s a lot of folks
 coming out of that and and getting hired into shops where
 you know we hope that they’re going
 to get um adequate mentoring and and be able to work with
 folks that have more experience and be
 able to to get their skills um up to where they need to be
 because i am some of them are having
 you know anywhere in the world and they’re not going to be
 able to get their skills up to where
 from a few weeks of training to a few months of hands-on
 training and we had some back and forth
 about you know kind of what what do you need you know to
 crack into to the industry so it was
 overall the theme positive towards this this this trend or
 was it more of a kind of like i think it
 was i think it was i think it was positive with some notes
 of caution sounded you know and some
 some notes of wanting uh those of us in position to
 exercise leadership to to make sure that
 this doesn’t become a glut not in the sense of driving down
 wages but in the sense of um you know
 potentially affecting negatively affecting the quality
 level of projects you know resulting in
 more rescues needed and things like that that was really
 the only um you know kind of negative area
 of conversation we also talked about you know how much the
 freelancers make and and how much do you
 know to regular hires make and how do you hire them and
 advice for getting noticed by employers
 and things like that and i think that’s a really good point
 and i think that’s a really good point
 like that came up as well and i mean i also wonder if there
‘s the risk of association of
 ruby if a whole bunch of uh hundreds of or thousands of new
bie developers are coming out
 and they know ruby on rails and they go into a project and
 then you know the project manager
 doesn’t understand that they’re just juniors there’s a bad
 name for ruby at rails and maybe
 developing an aversion to it just because of a false signal
 yeah i don’t know there’s a sense
 that could happen but you know i i have a feeling that a
 lot of these uh schools and training
 programs that that you know they’re helping with the
 placement they’re pretty active something that
 right now that jeff has definitely spoken to me personally
 about but came up a little bit in the
 panel um where they’re setting expectations you know
 correctly but for the folks that are getting
 into it you know there just seems to be no limit to the
 demand right you know so a lot of these
 you know 50 60 70 thousand dollars oh you know depending on
 the market that you’re going into
 yeah and depending on where they’re coming from that could
 be a huge bump i know one person i
 mentored was went from twenty thousand dollars to somewhere
 in that range yeah it’s like you can
 have a dramatic impact on their life on a person’s lives
 yeah and and we also talked about you know
 the the inverse of that which is when when you do have
 experience and you start making you know
 into the six figures how it how it ramps off you know
 we mentioned that we we don’t know too many people who who
 has employees in rails jobs are making
 like 200 000 or more right um and how it’s interesting that
 that that space between 100
 and 200 the the thousands tend to lose significance right
 so just because an employer is offering say
 150 versus 130 right it it doesn’t make that much of a
 difference if the culture and other
 softer factors are not there and and one of the things that
 i like about
 hired and one of the reasons that that i like alan and what
 he’s doing there is that they get
 the money discussion out of the way first so that the
 employee can can focus on the other issues
 yeah isn’t hired kind of where they have a like a tier you
 have to go through a certain amount of
 criterion to even the curate the you know you can sign up
 for hired but basically they curate who
 they have on there to set a minimum bar and then the
 employers um you know decide who they want to
 put the terms up front right you know so at that point um
 if i’m looking for a job my understanding
 is that i i can decide who has met my terms right off the
 bat so that i don’t go through a long
 interview process and then get to the stage where they make
 me an offer and it’s like oh i can’t
 work for a hundred thousand dollars in san francisco that’s
 impossible right you know or
 or whatever yeah whatever the case may be yeah very very
 frustrating so they invert that and i
 don’t know what they’re going to do so i’m just going to go
 ahead and say i’m just going to go
 ahead and say i’m just going to go ahead and say i’m just
 going to go ahead and say i’m just going
 sticker price is what you’re going to pay i think you’d be
 happy with that now yeah sure yeah so
 um you know just going back to some of your early history
 with with ruby on rails um i’m just
 curious you know you’ve written a number of books and an
 ongoing series and and with a pro
 ruby series uh how did you get started with with teaching
 and and being because this seems to be a
 theme inside of the community is that people teach and they
 they bring others up how did you get
 in the early days did you get involved in in publishing i
 mean i got pulled into it through
 through my activities in in blogging and i used to be
 someone who who had a well-read blog in the
 java world before i made the leap and then once i i got
 into to ruby in 2005 and became a loud
 evangelist for it it attracted a lot of attention and and
 back then that world was a lot smaller and
 it was a lot easier to get dialogues going and to you know
 you didn’t have to get lucky with hacker
 news in order for for everyone to read your stuff like it
 was actually a lot easier to to get heard
 yeah i know better single noise i know about the pain of
 getting people out to watch yeah
 definitely it’s a different it’s a different world now um
 but that said quality content always wins
 and um what it’s it’s interesting to see the community
 reinvent itself and kind of renew itself
 and what we’re seeing here is always just like the little
 tip of the iceberg uh granted you know when
 started out it was a really small iceberg and the people on
 the tip uh you know were those of us that
 were blogging and giving conference talks and stuff like
 that and everyone knew each other
 and it’s funny to see how over the years the the community
 that’s active and blogs and stuff like
 that the characters change and they morph and they evolve
 and they go off into other areas but
 it stays kind of relatively the same size but what’s been
 really amazing to watch um you know
 partly for me looking at the royalty checks and the size
 that they’re getting
 is how big the rails community has gotten i mean just hit
 the mainstream in our inner way that
 i think has exceeded our wildest dreams in the early days
 yeah that’s that’s something that
 maybe those of us who are just participating in the
 community might not see but being able to see
 like wow the total numbers of people buying these books is
 growing it does it grows every year and
 it just it goes and then you see you come to like this year
‘s rails comp and you see like you know
 how many people are hiring
 for rails jobs and who they are and like um companies
 continuing to switch over from dot net
 and java deployments and just redoing entire development
 department yeah tearing infrastructure
 out and starting over and it’s it’s it’s heartening to
 watch that the community keeps growing yeah
 and now if you’re on the other end of the spectrum of of
 your years of publishing uh are you looking
 at the change in the way books are published i mean in the
 early days it would have been hard
 yeah um and tomes but now it seems like things are moving
 towards uh ebooks is that something
 that you’re experiencing or moving towards uh it’s still
 you know if you want to write a book
 your best bet is to to start by self-publishing your ebook
 but uh you know keep it keep in mind
 that traditional publishers are happy to sign ebook authors
 and a lot of times we’ll just take
 your ebook and you know maybe with some editing or
 something you know or whatever publish it as a
 print book and uh there is still a lot of value in being
 published with a prestigious
 publishing house like like actually wesley or riley or w
iley uh you know where you know it
 gives you credibility and that’s what it’s all about yeah
 you know how to get that that people
 will have that automatic trust oh i know that publisher
 publishes good books exactly i’m gonna
 give this book a chance you know it really does wonders for
 your career um testament to that you
 know it’s once you get a book published it’s a great book
 it’s a great book it’s a great book
 published uh people start looking to you as an authority
 yeah well again thank you very much for
 taking the time to speak with me i really appreciate it my
 pleasure thanks a lot thanks

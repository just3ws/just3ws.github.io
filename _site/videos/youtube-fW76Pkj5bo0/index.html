      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2014. I’m
 standing with Max DeMarzi,
 who’s going to be presenting on graph databases and both
 with graph databases with Neo4j. But he
 also runs the Neo4j, or I should say the Windy City GraphDB
 database user group. That’s a mouthful.
 Windy City GraphDB meetup here in Chicago. Max, thanks for
 taking the time to speak with me. So
 your presentation, what is the title of the presentation
 and what is the gist of what you’re
 going to be talking about? Sure. So the presentation is
 basically just in relation to graph databases.
 And the idea of the presentation is to take you through a
 bunch of different use cases or things
 you can do with the graph. Whether you’re building a new
 social network, looking at permission
 management or network ontology, there’s many different
 places where graphs fit. One of the
 models of Neo4j is that graphs are everywhere. And we kind
 of want to show that and say, look,
 they really are everywhere. So, I mean, for people who
 might be familiar with a relational database,
 what’s the difference between something like Neo4j and RDB
MS? The difference is how we handle
 relationships. In a relational database, you’re always
 joining. Every time you make a query, you’re asking
 to find a way to connect these two things together. In the
 graph, we don’t do that. Instead, we connect
 when you create things. So the relationships get created
 ahead of time. And what that gives you is
 the ability to say, how is this connected? By a pointer
 that I can traverse directly. I don’t have
 to worry about how big my join tables get or anything like
 that. Everything is an O1 cost to
 you when you’re trying to join two things together. And
 that helps you scale when you have highly
 connected components in your data model. Okay. And so it’s
 not quite analogous to
 a foreign key relationship described in RDBMS. It’s
 something like a relationship is its own entity.
 Yeah. And to be honest, it is kind of a foreign key. It’s
 really, the foreign key is in memory
 and it’s a pointer. So it’s not a different table you have
 to go and scan and find. It’s really,
 it’s just right there waiting for you. And that’s what
 really makes it fast. Computer science,
 there’s no magic. It’s always data structures and
 algorithms. So we have a data structure that’s
 optimized for connecting things together. And that’s the
 difference between us and relational
 database. Okay. And Neo4j, that’s not like a closed source.
 That’s not like Oracle or
 something like that. That’s another interesting aspect of
 this presentation is that Neo4j is an
 open source. Yeah, absolutely. It’s an open source library.
 It’s been around for about 10 years.
 And if you want to use a community edition, you’re welcome
 to use it anywhere you use MySQL.
 I do a lot of examples also on my blog at maximars.com
 where I show you everything I do and
 have all the sources available on GitHub. So you’re free to
 download and play with it and build your
 own stuff with it. You know, it’s one of the nice things
 about working in an open source company
 that everything you do, it gets to be open source. You don
‘t have to worry about it. You know,
 there’s a few bits and pieces that are client code that are
 closed source, but in the end,
 I turn those around and make blog posts out of them anyway.
 Right. So there’s always that sharing. And just in the
 spirit of sharing, going to the user group
 itself,
 the WindyCityGraphDB user group, which probably reads a lot
 easier than it rolls off the tongue.
 But are you the founder of the group or are you an
 organizer over there?
 Sure. I started the group about two years ago because I
 fell in love with Neo4j, the product.
 And I was a community user for about four years. I only
 joined the company about a year and a half
 ago. I just love the product. I fell in love with it. Like
 I said, it’s addictive to be able to do
 things in Graph. I was a SQL developer for years, and that
‘s a lot worse.
 But usually I wrap a blog post or two, and then I will
 present the blog post and explain how it was
 done, get more details, answer people’s questions. And then
 if people have their own ideas of what
 they want to do with the graph, I’ll show how they could do
 it. It’s really about the audience,
 whatever they want, whatever they need, they have access to
 ask questions and learn something from
 it.
 Yeah. And so the format, you said you started the group
 because you were already passionate about
 Neo4j.
 And then you’ve been…
 Writing blog posts and you come up with an idea for a
 presentation, then you write it up and then
 do the talk at the user group?
 Yeah, pretty much. I mean, the ideas come from customer
 work we do and also from just random
 people emailing me, “Hey, how would I do this in the Graph
?”
 Right.
 And sometimes it’s easier to just build it than to tell
 them how they would do it.
 Right.
 You know, nothing speaks louder than code. So I’ll show
 them, “Here’s the code.”
 Yeah.
 Someone knows how to connect to Facebook. “Well, here’s the
 code to do it.” Not just theoretically
 how you would do it.
 Yeah. And do you ever have anybody come in from outside?
 And do presentations or is it mostly just you’re fielding
 these requests or these questions?
 We have a few customers in the area and sometimes they’ll
 come and talk and show you what they’ve
 done.
 Okay.
 But a lot of times it’s hard because Neo4j stuff seems to
 be secret sauce for a lot of
 people. So they can’t really show us proprietary stuff they
‘re doing. But a lot of times it’s
 really just me. I wish I hadn’t been helping me out. I wish
 there were more open source
 projects out there in Chicago doing it so that they could
 help me out. But there’s always something,
 and I can talk about graphs wherever.
 Yeah. And we talked a little bit before this conversation
 about, there was a little example of
 a Meetups app that was looking at some of the analytics and
 statistics around user group
 meetings. Do you know anything about that?
 Sure. It’s something one of my colleagues built. And I
 think he’s going to expand it out. But the
 general idea is, do you know anything about that?
 Sure. It’s something one of my colleagues built. And I
 think he’s going to expand it out. But the general idea is,
 you can see how people, they belong to a group, but they
 also belong to many other groups. So
 they’re related through that. They’re also interests that
 these groups are about. Whether
 they’re about big data, they’re about NoSQL, whether they
‘re about Java, whatever they’re
 about, you can connect groups that way and connect people
 that way. And you can expand it further
 out. If you wanted to see what other groups, the cities I
 may want to go visit based on my current
 likes, something else you can do. Connect products to
 people through it as well, same thing. You have
 the trick to the graph really is if you have two points
 that you want to connect together through
 some common language, whether it’s, you know, same unit
 groups, same company, same product, same,
 whatever it is, you can do it through the relationships in
 the graph and just combing
 through and finding paths from one point to the other.
 Okay. And is this up on GitHub or is this a website? Do you
 know?
 It’s both. It’s a website. I don’t have the URL in my head,
 but it’s, it’s, you can usually just
 find Neo4j and Meetup and you’ll, you’ll find it.
 Everything we do is open source,
 so it should be up there somewhere.
 Right. So you have a
 repo on, I mean, an organization on GitHub.
 Yeah, there’s a Neo4j, there’s a Neo Contrib, there’s Neo
 Community. There’s just,
 we have like a whole bunch. Everything is on GitHub. You
 can see the guys’ latest commits on,
 on, on Neo4j dot slash Neo4j and you can see what the team
 worked on yesterday night.
 It’s kind of nice, right? You can see exactly what we’re
 doing every single day. And we know
 the bug fixes that come in, the pull requests that come in,
 it’s all right there.
 Okay. Well, thank you very much for taking the time to
 speak with me.
 No worries.
 Thanks.
 User groups with
 lots to say, interviews and more. No way. Sharing great
 ideas in the tech community.

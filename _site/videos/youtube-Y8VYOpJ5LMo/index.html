    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015 and
 I’m standing here with Gail Tenney who just gave a talk on
 faster Java objects and is going to be doing a workshop on
 application responsiveness as well as a case study.
 So you’re pretty busy here at the conference, but I got a
 little bit of time to speak with you and I really
 appreciate that.
 So let’s start with the talk you just gave about faster
 Java objects. What was that about?
 It’s about faster Java. The talk really focuses on a
 project that we’ve been working on, an open source project
 from Wikimedia for a year and a half or so.
 We are actually hoping for this to mature and get into Open
JDK, into the standard Java SE 9 or 10, some version.
 And the purpose of it is to actually allow Java to have
 faster objects in array in a way that matches C for speed.
 So it’s actually removing what I believe is the last
 inherent speed difference we in Java can see on speed.
 Oh, really?
 There are lots of other speed differences that could be,
 but they’re not inherent. This is inherent.
 Is this addressing the startup warm-up problem or is it
 more of the JVM is running and it’s warmed up and these
 just allocations?
 It’s actually not a warm-up or a compilation related thing.
 It’s actually memory layout.
 Okay.
 So there’s…
 There are certain constructs that are natural to use in C
 and end up being laid out in memory in a way that is either
 optimal to access in a streaming fashion or quick to get to
 a random location in them.
 Where in Java, doing the exact same semantic thing requires
 dereferencing through multiple hops and accessing more
 randomly than in an order predictable manner.
 Which means that actual access on real hardware ends up
 being slower for the same semantic structure.
 We’re looking to close…
 We’re looking to close the gap for every one of the common
 ways you do it in C to have a common natural way to do it
 in Java for any type of Java object you already have, but
 in a way that gives you fast access to them.
 And from what I understand, you have a reference
 implementation or the Azul has its own VM version? Does
 that have these optimizations already in there?
 So Azul makes multiple JVMs. One of them is called Zing. It
‘s a JVM with better metrics.
 It eliminates garbage collection, has much better latency
 characteristics, faster for some things.
 And we also make Zulu, which is basically vanilla OpenJDK.
 We are probably the best binary distribution for OpenJDK
 because we’re probably the only one for several platforms,
 Macs and Windows.
 Neither one of those…
 Object Cloud is not specific to Azul.
 We will certainly put it in our products once the project
 is there and adopted.
 And I would expect Zing, for example, to optimize it well.
 We’re obviously doing it to make sure that it is the case.
 But we will be demonstrating the speed benefit of object
 layout-based objects on both Zing and OpenJDK proof-of-con
cept implementations.
 Our goal is to actually have this be part of the standard
 Java, part of OpenJDK, part of anybody’s JDK in the future.
 But the VMs that you’re talking about, the Zulu and the Zen
, are those something that I could install on my Linux
 distribution?
 And run Java code against?
 Or is it bespoke for your infrastructure?
 Just the JDK.
 Zing is Linux only, but any Linux.
 And yes, you just install it on Linux and run your existing
 Java code.
 Zero changes to it.
 You turn it on and five minutes later you have a better JVM
.
 Or one minute later.
 With Zulu, it’s beyond just Linux.
 It’s on Linux, on Mac, on Windows.
 In fact, we are the only binary you can get today for Mac
 or Windows that is OpenJDK.
 You can get the Oracle JVM.
 It’s a good JVM.
 Right.
 If you want the open source one, we’re it.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, because, I mean, as somebody who’s more of a casual J
VM user, I use it mostly to power a JRuby app or some
 closure code.
 But you’re saying that I could look and evaluate, like,
 maybe I could develop against Zen.
 I’m sorry, this is Zing.
 Zing.
 Develop against Zing and also go to production with Zing.
 I mean, is that at that level?
 You could do that, but because it is so interchangeable,
 you don’t need to develop to it.
 There are no new APIs in it.
 There’s nothing you do to write for Zing.
 Okay.
 It just runs Java code.
 Yeah.
 I mostly just didn’t mean that it wasn’t production ready.
 Is there extra hooks, profiler hooks or things that I’d be
 able to use?
 So, Zing does have a lot of nice features.
 None of them are language changes.
 Spec changes.
 They’re just, you know, where normally people have a hard
 time dealing with a lot of objects or high allocation rates
 or, you know, people think that multiple gigabytes is a big
 number.
 Zing runs at exactly the same responsiveness level, whether
 you’re at a gigabyte or a terabyte or any number in the
 middle.
 It can handle 20 gigabytes a second of allocation or 20 meg
abytes a second.
 Both of those are 1,000x ranges.
 And it’s really the quality where it has this extreme
 smooth operating range.
 You don’t have to worry about.
 You don’t have to worry about things like garbage
 collection and hiccups and stalls and deoptimizations
 hurting you.
 It’s built to eliminate the hiccups.
 It’s built to be fast all the time rather than fast and go
 out to lunch and come back from lunch and go fast again.
 Which, unfortunately, is how Java’s behaved for the last 20
 years.
 Zulu is vanilla.
 I call it vanilla.
 It’s exactly the way the regular Oracle JVM behaves or Open
JK.
 It is OpenJK.
 It is no different.
 We build it.
 We give it to people for free.
 We certify it.
 We test it.
 And we give it away for free.
 For Zulu, we sell enterprise support.
 We support vendors who want to embed a JVM or JDK in their
 products, like a router or an ATM machine or just a piece
 of software that wants a JDK inside.
 Zulu is a natural fit there, too.
 But it’s exactly the same.
 Both of our JVMs are drop-in identical, the same as you
 just get a different version of a JVM from Oracle.
 We get one from us.
 You can have all.
 All of them together and choose per application which one
 you want to use.
 And you should expect no functional behavior difference
 between them.
 Obviously, with Zing, we hope you’ll get better metrics,
 mostly around lower noise, jitter, hiccups, stalls,
 whatever it is that bothers you,
 and the ability to smoothly run large things without
 worrying about them.
 It drives me a little nuts to hear that there’s the
 reference implementation that’s Oracle, and you’d expect a
 multibillion-dollar corporation.
 I have the reference implementation that’s perfectly
 optimized.
 But looking at a smaller company, obviously smaller than
 Oracle, it’s like my brain wants to say there’s got to be
 some trade-off.
 Well, so let me correct you on one thing.
 The reference implementation for Java is OpenJDK, not
 Oracle.
 There’s only one reference implementation.
 It’s OpenJDK.
 That is where Java is developed, defined, and productized.
 Oh, okay.
 People then take that and build other JDKs from, either
 directly open source from it or closed source derivatives
 of it through the Oracle licensing schemes.
 And Oracle JDK is a closed source version of OpenJDK with
 some added tooling, for example, and other things.
 So is Zing.
 So is the IBM JDK.
 So is everybody else’s.
 Then Zulu is actually OpenJDK, nothing more.
 Exactly.
 And that’s where it’s the closest thing to an open source
 distribution.
 OpenJDK is just source code.
 Red Hat, by the way, also makes a very good binary build of
 OpenJDK.
 But I would say that between Red Hat and Azul, that’s where
 you can get trusted OpenJDK builds.
 Somebody actually tested them to see that they’re right.
 You didn’t build it from source and hope.
 Because it’s a delicate process.
 We run the 70,000 plus TCK tests.
 We run Thrill QA stuff we’ve been doing for 10 years.
 And when we’re good and happy with it, then we put it up
 and say, that binary with Dutch XM is certified compatible.
 It’s fascinating.
 So when we’re talking about OpenJDK, really what we’re
 talking about is a source code that represents that
 reference implementation,
 not the binary that I install as an end user of the VM.
 But I would look at Zulu or Oracle or IBM or Zing or the
 Red Hat ICT.
 Their plug-in interchangeable should be because that’s what
 the Java spec is all about.
 You should not have to be changing.
 You’re code when you switch the runtime.
 And Java’s actually pretty good at that.
 It’s been very well-policed to do that.
 And I think as a community, we’ve done a great job.
 Oracle and Sun before did a great job at this.
 It’s one of the things that make Java so successful.
 Yeah.
 Fascinating.
 Yeah.
 And how about Dalvik?
 As I understand, Dalvik is kind of its own flavor of Java.
 And you’re putting me in a controversial environment.
 Oh, okay.
 Sorry.
 Not intentionally.
 So Dalvik doesn’t call itself Java.
 It better not.
 But unfortunately, you write to it in exactly the Java
 stuff,
 but not exactly the Java stuff.
 So Dalvik is a fork of Java.
 You can think of it that way.
 You’re building in what looks like Java.
 You’re using Java IDs, Java libraries.
 But it’s not quite Java.
 For example, not everything works.
 Right.
 And in reverse, you take from Dalvik and it won’t work on a
 JDK,
 and you take from a JDK.
 Like something that runs a Java, it might not work on Dal
vik.
 Some things do, some things don’t.
 It’s just a reflection.
 Yeah.
 You know?
 Yeah.
 And various other things.
 So unfortunately, in the Dalvik world, there is no spec,
 or no good spec that is similar to Java.
 But we can’t argue that Dalvik’s not popular.
 It’s extremely popular for sort of user interface embedded
 devices and such.
 And it’s very successful there.
 I think the world has spoken.
 I think it’s unfortunate that it’s a fork and that it doesn
‘t do the entire spec.
 You know?
 Yeah.
 That’s not for me to do anything about.
 Yeah.
 Well, it sounds like they are focusing on a specific
 vertical of a certain type of device,
 not general purpose.
 And now it’s said to be able to tune it for those devices.
 Yeah.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to
 me.
 It’s fascinating.
 So OpenJDK is just code, so.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yes, exactly.
 Thank you.
 Absolutely.</p>

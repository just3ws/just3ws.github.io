    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, I’m Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at SCNA again. I’m sitting down with
 Cully Smith who has run a user group on the University of Wisconsin campus and
 he had an interesting perspective on the needs of a student user group
 versus those of some of us who are out in the professional world where we
 typically consider the attendees of a user group. So thanks for sitting
 down. What was it that was unique about running a user group for
 students than when you came out of college coming into MAD Railers?
 What was your experience? Yeah, so the users group was geared toward not only
 students but also professionals on campus. So in Madison, Wisconsin we have
 MAD Railers which is an established users group and it meets on Monday
 evenings. The first perspective that we were trying to offer as a MAD Railers
 group, as well as a lot of other MAD Railers, was to create a user group for
 other users groups. It’s geared towards startup companies, towards enterprises,
 things like that, but the campus has specific needs. A lot of times they’re
 dealing with not new products, but they’re dealing with how to write
 software with existing things in place. So trying to come in and change the
 culture to be more agile, to be more lean, was simply not feasible. It was out of
 their control. If you have a startup or a business, you might get some headway in
 doing that. Or if you have a small department,
 but quite often on campus you didn’t even have a department. You had one
 individual working on a code base. So what we were trying to do was create a
 resource for the campus to use to say these are some of the products that are
 being developed across the campus and where are some ways that we can
 consolidate our efforts and to do some knowledge sharing. Because if someone
 else is building an application very similar in say the Department of
 Medicine to something that someone else is doing in the Department of
 Communications and those people don’t have a way to
 talk, a central location to meet, a lot of times there’s going to be wasted efforts.
 So instead of just having a newsletter, it’s like hey let’s get everybody together
 casually let’s talk about this cool stuff and then let it naturally let them
 talk and get to know each other in a less controlled, less structured
 environments. You’re not in a meeting, you’re in a user group.
 Yeah, we started off with just a mailing list. So we were using a mailing list and
 we found that there was there were some topics that just did not translate well.
 And we wanted and people also wanted an opportunity to learn. They wanted to go
 in and see someone present on test-driven development, but not under
 the preconceived notion that it was going to be something that you were
 going to be able to implement, but just what are some of the ways that we can
 start doing test-driven development. And also on campus, even though this was a
 Ruby on Rails meetup group, we were opening it up to people that were from
 coming from different backgrounds, from Java, from .NET, from other things.
 And so it was sort of language agnostic.
 So even though you were underneath the label of a Rails group, it was, hey,
 whoever’s cool, whoever wants to come in and learn about these things, these
 concepts, not necessarily Rails, but concepts that are popular on Rails, they were all
 welcome to come in. Yeah. Did you get some people like that? Quite a few people came
 in just that were doing JavaScript stuff. Okay. So on campuses, mobile is a very big
 concern right now, writing things for mobile apps, because students are walking
 around with phones, with tablets from class to class. And so you could either be
 doing iOS or Android or something for native apps, but a lot of people were
 building their apps and then just having like a JavaScript framework, like PhoneGap
 or something like that, so that they could wrap it. So we had quite a few people
 that were interested in using test-driven development and agile approaches to the
 JavaScript side. So when you came out of college and you moved out and you moved on from the school,
 the university environment, out into a professional environment, I should say, were you, I should
 say actually, were you a student at the university? I was actually an employee. Oh, you were an
 employee. Yes. Okay. And you were, but you were trying to reach out to students? We had
 students, and we were trying to expose students, because that was one of the things that we
 had learned, that a lot of students that were going through a traditional computer science
 program weren’t exposed to things like test-driven development, like agile, and things like that.
 They were learning data structures, they were learning things like that, but they weren’t
 understanding how that was going to be implemented. Right. And the Madison community has a number
 of startup companies. They have Bendyworks, which is a software consulting shop, and a
 number of other software consulting, or software startup companies that were wanting to hire
 people, but there was a huge gap between what the students were actually learning at school
 and how they were going to be asked to practice it. So yeah, we did reach out to students
 just to say, well, this is what pair programming is, this is what agile is, this is what test-driven
 development is. Yeah. There were
 students that were learning data structures, and schema, and root, and Java, and then coming
 out and having to figure out how to write up an application. Yeah. It’s a big gap. Yeah.
 So, but when you came out of working in the university environments into the more traditional
 business startup culture, what kind of became of the user group on the campus? We needed
 someone to come in and take over and support it. I think that there are still efforts to
 get it going, but the problem, I think, is if you don’t have someone that, you know,
 has the vision to get it done. Right. So, it’s still sitting there, and at this time,
 it’s mainly just a practical matter. I don’t have the same permissions to book rooms on
 a campus, so even though I still would have a great interest in doing so, I would need
 someone on campus. So, it’s more of a bureaucracy kind of holding you back. Yeah. So, okay.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to sit down. Yeah, thank you. Appreciate it.
 Thank you.</p>

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015,
 and I’m sitting here with
 Vyacheslav Egorov, who gave a talk on benchmarking JS.
 Thank you
 very much for taking the time to speak with me. When you
 talk about
 benchmarking JS, are you talking about client-side JS? I
 mean, JS lives in a lot
 of different places. Is this Node? Is this browser JS? What
 are you benchmarking?
 So, I don’t have any particular focus. I’m just looking at
 the pure JavaScript
 performance. So, it doesn’t matter if you run your
 JavaScript on the client-side or
 server-side. Basically, no matter where you are, my talk
 applies to you. Okay. So,
 you know, even if I’m in V8 or Rhino or whatever, it’s
 going to be… Okay, so,
 when you talk, what techniques and tools were you talking
 about? Where
 did this talk come from? What experiences did you have that
 led you to
 this? Well, I used to work on the V8 team, and when you
 work on a team of
 the VM engineers, you usually get different
 questions from the users, in this case, JavaScript
 developers, who don’t
 completely understand what happens inside the VM and how
 they should
 measure performance of their code. And that’s what this
 talk is based on.
 Basically, I monitor different social media, and I see
 people posting different
 benchmarks, and I look what happens there, and I explain
 why these benchmarks are
 usually incorrect. And that’s, yeah, that’s basically my
 experience. So, what is
 some of the things that you see that are incorrect, and
 like, what are some of the
 maybe some quick tips that maybe, or articles people should
 read or try to
 understand better about JavaScript performance? I think the
 biggest issue is
 that people still think that JavaScript implementations are
 very dumb, but these
 implementations are quite smart. So, I think that that’s
 the main thing that
 they should know about that, and they should always account
 for the very
 advanced optimizations that the GIS engines are capable of
 doing now. So, there is no
 really single tip. They should just try to understand what
‘s happening on the side. Okay.
 Now, I mean, do, if you’re dealing with V8 optimization, I
 mean, because one of the
 things is JavaScript is one that’s run anywhere, and it
 runs on V8 or Rhino or
 different browsers, or, you know, does the wisdom of this
 is good for
 JavaScript apply generally everywhere, or do you find
 people maybe benchmarking,
 and you say, oh, you did that benchmark on V8, try it on a
 different VM, and you’ll see
 that it gets much different performance characteristics. Is
 that a pretty common situation?
 Sometimes that happens, but these days, the implementations
 really converge on, they
 apply the same techniques, so it’s quite often that you see
 the same performance
 characteristics across all of the platforms you use. That’s
 why this talk is
 quite universal, and this issue is quite universal. Okay,
 and when you’re looking
 at the way JavaScript is being implemented, I mean, I’ve
 heard, I’m hearing on
 Twitter, there’s a number of people that are tweeting about
, you know, if you’re doing, if
 you’re trying to implement a class structure in JavaScript,
 you know, I’m just talking
 about writing JavaScript, you know, don’t reimplement the
 classical inheritance structure
 inside of JavaScript versus, you know, using the polymorph
ic capabilities of JavaScript
 and the prototypal, that’s actually the word I was trying
 to say, prototype, it’s the end
 of the day, guys, sorry, the prototypal inheritance and
 using different ways of structuring
 your application, does that often not just play into the
 way people reason
 about writing JavaScript, but its performance, that, you
 know, if I’m implementing a
 class in JavaScript, you know, is that generally gonna
 perform worse or better
 than if I do something that’s more of a native structure?
 So the thing is that
 JavaScript engines, they evolve naturally, so they follow
 the paths that people are
 using, so they optimize for the patterns that people are
 using. In this sense, if you use, for example,
 constructors and prototypes, this is actually the most
 performant way of writing JavaScript,
 especially if you keep everything, like, kind of static,
 and yeah, you just follow the common
 patterns and then you will be safe.
 Okay, okay, and as far as working on the V8 engine itself,
 that, I didn’t realize it before
 our conversation, that, how did you get involved in working
 on actually the V8, which has become
 something of a industry change?
 Not just with a Chrome browser, but with Node being built
 on that. I mean, you’re
 working on some pretty intense technology. How did you get
 involved in
 working on that team, and what were you doing with them?
 So, well, I stopped working on V8 three years ago, but I
 was doing the Java VM
 before back in Russia, and then V8 people were searching
 for, like, a person with a
 compiler background, and they hired me, so I joined the
 team, and I worked on different
 parts of the V8, so from garbage collection to compiler
 infrastructure, and yeah, so that’s
 what I was doing. So, basically, I have the background in
 this, and that background seems
 to fit with what the team needed.
 Right, okay, and you know, you described earlier about two
 things, you know, one is that the
 JavaScript implementations are much smarter than people
 give them credit for, and that
 the current patterns are, are, of how people write their
 applications are being used in
 the JavaScript, and how they’re being used to, to derive
 the future of, of, how these
 JVMs, excuse me, JVMs, I don’t know, JSVMs work. I mean, is
 there something in the direction
 that you just see as a common pattern that people are using
 that you kind of wish they
 would just move away from, though? Like, even though we
 have classical inheritance structure,
 or what we call classical, you know, class and inheritance,
 but if they just maybe wrote
 their JavaScript this other way, it would be a lot more
 efficient.
 Right.
 And they might get a lot more native, and they might get a
 lot more benefits that they
 don’t see now. Is there anything, any advice or
 observations you’ve made?
 No, I actually have an opposite issue. So, the, the
 JavaScript VMs, even though they
 are quite smart, they still, because they evolve by
 following what people do, they are
 very focused. So, what I really want them to do is to start
 expanding this area of fast
 JavaScript and support, like, different corners of the
 language they do not support well,
 or they just fall to the slow path, and so on.
 So, it’s actually the other way around.
 Yeah.
 Not the people. So, the, the…
 Well, no, you’re saying you wish they would do more of, be
 aware of these other types
 of structures.
 Yes, exactly.
 Yeah. Yeah. So, you, you are a little bit frustrated with
 it. Hey, we’re just going
 to do this one type of structure, but JavaScript is so much
 more than that.
 Precisely.
 Okay, great. Well, thank you very much for taking the time
 to speak with me.
 Thank you for speaking with me.
 Yes, I appreciate it. All right, thank you.</p>

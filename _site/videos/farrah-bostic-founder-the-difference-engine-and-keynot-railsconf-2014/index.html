    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with Ucastic. I’m here at RailsConf 2014, and
 I’m standing here with
 Farah Bostic, who gave the end-of-the-day keynote on our
 first day of conference. Farah, thank you
 for taking the time to speak with me. This is take two, I
 apologize about that. So, Farah, can you
 tell us about what the keynote was about, the subject? Sure
, the title of the talk was “What
 happens to everyone when everyone learns to code?” And I’m
 a beginner coder myself, I’ve built a few
 things, I use Rails as the framework for doing that. But
 the thing that I was thinking a lot
 about is what happens when more people start to be kind of
 like me, where we have a kind of
 conversational understanding of code, and how does that
 impact how we all can work together,
 techs and tech and dev people and non-tech and dev people.
 And really, it kind of came down to,
 a little bit of storytelling about my path into Rails and
 into the community, as well as some
 ideas that I’ve been thinking a lot about in terms of, we
 need non-technical people, need the
 technical people to be part of the strategy of a product
 and to be part of the real high-level
 decision-making about the business and the user experience,
 and really what kind of problem we’re
 trying to solve. And so that means we need to understand a
 little bit more of code, and we’re
 going to have fluent conversations, and we’re going to be
 able to do that. And we’re going to
 have conversations with our dev partners, and our dev
 partners need to have more sort of investment
 and understanding of the decisions that have to be made at
 the business level and at the user
 experience level.
 And you’re not the first person I’ve heard of that is a
 business person who came into Rails.
 What is it about, then you come into programming through
 Rails, what was it about Rails in
 particular that, how did you even find out about it?
 Right, it was a combination of things. I had been a little
 bit familiar with PHP from a while
 back.
 I actually started out as a copywriter in advertising, but
 the thing about being a copywriter in
 advertising is not a lot of agencies need junior copyw
riters. So I went to work for a web design
 shop. And so you had to kind of learn how to make things on
 the internet. It was too small of a
 business to have specialists, really. So I knew a little
 bit about PHP, hadn’t done anything with it
 in a really long time. And a friend of mine, Noah Breyer,
 who founded Percolate, he kind of
 reintroduced me to PHP and to kind of application.
 Right.
 And so I played around a little bit with PHP. I went to a
 startup weekend in New York in
 like October 2010 and was talking to lots of people about
 wanting to take that a little
 bit farther and learning to code and asking for advice on
 how to do that. And just about
 every developer I talked to at startup weekend said Rails
 was probably the most friendly
 framework for getting into coding at the application level
 because it’s bit pseudo-code that runs,
 right?
 Right.
 So it’s like, it’s as close to plain language as you’re
 going to get. And so it was kind
 of hard to get. That was the take in 2010 at least. And
 then that got layered on with
 picking up Chris Pine’s book, Learning to Program, and that
‘s Ruby-based, so then I
 started to get a little bit of an understanding of the
 underlying framework. And then my boyfriend
 is Stuart Echols, who’s a Rails guy, so he sort of got
 layered on with more help.
 Okay.
 So there was some…
 Yes.
 Because I’ve heard recently that Rails is… There’s
 concern in the Rails community that
 it’s becoming much harder to…
 Much harder to get started. So I was curious as to when…
 You said 2010 was around the
 time that you got started. I just would like to go a little
 further and ask, have you continued
 to use Rails since then, or…?
 Yeah. Yeah, I have. And in fact, I sort of just started
 playing around at the playing
 around level. And then I used Rails to build from the
 ground up my own website for my business.
 And I did that at least, we’ll say twice…
 Right.
 Like, shipped versions of the site. But of course it was
 more like 10,000 times, it seems
 like.
 Right.
 But both times, for both major designs of it, I did it all
 myself, I did it all in Rails.
 And so I kind of just keep coming back to that, because I
 now have a kind of comfort
 level with it. I know where things are. And so I can kind
 of drop back in any time.
 But I’m really curious, have you felt the changes in the
 ecosystem? I’m like, “Really,
 what’s this CoffeeScript thing?”
 I thought I just needed to know JavaScript, too.
 Right. Well, so that was also part of my talk yesterday, is
 that I think about as far as
 I’ve got with the actual application side really is Rails.
 And so I don’t understand
 anything about Java or Coffee or any of the rest of it. I
 drink coffee.
 Yeah.
 But so the thing for me winds up being a heavy dependency
 on Rails developers who translated
 a piece of script in another language into a gem that I can
 just go ahead and implement.
 Okay.
 And then every once in a while I have to ask for help when
 it really shouldn’t be
 done that way, or can’t yet be done that way. So I’ve
 noticed the changes, I’ve noticed
 these CoffeeScript files, and I’ve noticed those things.
 But I’m still pretty intimidated
 by going too far under the hood. So I live in model views
 and controllers and routes,
 and I kind of leave it as much as possible at that.
 That is the most pleasant area.
 Yes.
 The question I have is for other people who might be
 looking at learning to code, or at
 least they have a product idea or something they’d like to
 do. Is the ecosystem so friendly
 to that, from your perspective?
 I think so. I think there’s a couple of reasons why it
 still strikes me as incredibly
 friendly. And one is that Rails seems to be sort of the
 default framework for most of
 the code schools, or at least the preferred framework. So I
‘ve taken some classes through
 the Flatiron School in New York and Codecademy and other
 kinds of things. I still find it’s
 basically pretty intuitive.
 As far as I’m going to be intuitive for someone who’s never
 coded before. And I think it’s
 still a great place to relatively rapidly be able to make
 something that works. And
 just as an example of that, I was at a conference a couple
 of years ago where we were sort of
 doing brainstorming sessions around business people getting
 kind of creatively stuck. And
 everyone had the same kind of pieces of advice about how to
 get unstuck. And so we made little
 paper fortune tellers.
 Right.
 And we made basically a Rails app that does the same thing,
 just a randomizer.
 Right.
 And so like three hours later we had a working, very basic
 app. And Rails was a really friendly
 thing to do that in, because you could tell really quickly
 whether it worked.
 Yeah.
 Because someone else had already kind of worked out the
 basic mechanism of what’s basically
 a magic eight ball.
 Yeah.
 So, yeah.
 And as a developer myself, it’s fascinating to hear this.
 With the conversation this morning
 with, I was, I’m sorry, yesterday morning with DHH, there’s
 been so much, I don’t know
 how long at all, on Twitter, kerfuffle over whether or not
 TDD is dead or alive or is
 it on, but what do these say? You know, is it good or bad?
 And we obsess over these kind
 of details, but when DHH was talking, he was talking about
 letting go of this astronaut
 stuff. But then here are people who are not necessarily a
 developer background, are able
 to come into these tools and do something productive and
 rate and make money.
 Right.
 And pay the bills using these tools.
 Right.
 I mean, does that strike you as kind of bizarre, when you
 hear us obsessing over, like, whether
 or not we should do things a certain way, and you’re like,
 “I just took it, and I did
 it, and it’s great.”
 Right.
 There it is.
 Well, not at all. In fact, you know, my background being in
 marketing and market research, we
 have the same obsessions. We’re obsessing about the best
 way to buy media. We’re obsessing
 about programmatic ad buying. We’re obsessing about the
 most sciency ways of doing market
 research. And having spent 15 years working in those
 industries and kind of taking a step
 back and peeling back a lot of the trappings of that stuff,
 I think what I find sort of
 encouraging is every industry and every community is
 arguing about things that matter to them,
 whether they should matter or not. And that there is this
 kind of inevitable ebb and flow
 that seems to happen between obsessing about details or
 testing frameworks or making things
 easy or what really makes a coder versus not a coder. And
 those sort of existential debates
 are necessary to these communities. And then inevitably,
 somebody has to be the one who
 sort of drops a bomb and says, “Actually, those things don
‘t matter, or they don’t matter
 as much as we say they do.” So, DHH’s talk yesterday, I was
, like, jotting notes going,
 “Well, a lot of market research is also pseudoscience, and
 it’s the same kind of idea of test-driven
 development, but in communications.”
 Right.
 And that’s something that I’ve kind of gone…
 This beginner’s mind thing works pretty well for me in
 building stuff in Rails.
 It works pretty well for me in the way I do the work I do
 now as a product strategist,
 which is everything’s a bit rough and ready, and that’s the
 point, is we have to make decisions
 quickly. Things have to shift. We don’t have time to worry
 about, you know, the kind of
 metaphorical equivalent of four lines of test code for
 every one line of working code.
 And I really appreciate that whole, “Sometimes it just has
 to be good enough.”
 I wouldn’t have these interviews if it wasn’t…
 Eventually, just having to let go and be like, “Okay.”
 Exactly.
 And a lot of people come into the interviews and they say,
 “Well, what if I make a mistake
 or I stutter or, you know, what if I can’t think of an
 answer?”
 And I’m like, “I can’t think of questions.”
 It happens.
 But, you know, it’s all just…
 As long as you’re making something, eventually you can…
 Well, that’s the other thing I really responded to with his
 talk yesterday morning was this
 idea of, you know, the engineer metaphor, the science
 metaphor, and all those things
 were uncomfortable for him, that the truth is that coders
 are software writers.
 And because I started out as a writer as well and still do
 write, writing practice is writing
 practice, whether you’re writing a new gem or a new project
 or you’re writing an article
 or an essay or a short story.
 You have to sit down and write.
 And kind of the first thing you have to do is put ink on
 the page.
 And whatever format that looks like.
 Because the worst thing is a blank page, right?
 The worst moment for you right now is before you hit the
 record button because, “Oh, my
 God, what’s going to happen?”
 Or, likewise, when I hit Rails New and I’m trying to even
 think about what I should
 name the project.
 Yes, exactly.
 What should I name it, you know?
 I’m talking about obsessing over the wrong things.
 Right.
 And then you kind of forget the flexibility and the
 opportunity to edit.
 And, like, I don’t have to know what every field in my
 database is going to be when I
 raise the scaffold.
 At a certain point, I can just sort of – I can add things
 to it later.
 It’s minimal.
 Yeah, exactly.
 And so I really reacted to that as, like, yes, that I think
 is what I like about learning
 this language and this framework is that it’s a new way to
 think and to write.
 And I like both of those things.
 Well, great.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak.
 Thank you.
 Appreciate it.
 Yes, very much so.
 User groups with lots to say.
 Interviews and more.
 No way.

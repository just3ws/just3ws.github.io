      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with Utesc. I’m here again at GOTO Conf 2015,
 and I’m standing here with Charles Nutter,
 who’s giving a talk called Beyond the JVM. It’s a tongue tw
ister.
 I’ve been saying so many long titles today that trying to
 say a short title is actually more confusing.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 Sure.
 So, Beyond the JVM. What is Beyond the JVM?
 Well, this is a talk I’ve kind of been working on for a
 while,
 just to show people that the JVM is evolving and that a lot
 of the problems they may have heard about are starting to
 be solved.
 In this talk, I kind of took the approach of talking about
 the work we did on JRuby for the past nine years,
 the challenges of getting JRuby to run on the JVM and be
 compatible,
 and then threaded that story through a few different areas
 that the JVM is improving.
 I think it went pretty well. People seem to appreciate the
 work that’s being done.
 Yeah, and I mean, what are some of the examples?
 Like your JVM…
 JRuby is your domain, but are you looking at strictly the
 JRuby aspects or how JRuby improves off of this?
 Or is it just general JVM stuff that…
 Well, it ends up being very general.
 The problems that we had to solve are problems that
 developers on the JVM have had to deal with for a long time
.
 The three areas that I actually went into, I talked about
 how Ruby has tons of method calls.
 I mean, everything’s a method call all over the place.
 And using Invoke Dynamic, Java 7 features to optimize
 things a little bit better,
 make it possible for Ruby code to get some of the same JIT
 optimizations that Java does.
 We also had a strong need to be able to call native
 functions.
 There’s a lot of Unix and POSIX stuff in Ruby that has to
 be essentially the same behavior.
 We could emulate all of it or port all that sort of code
 and all that logic,
 but it ends up being much more compatible and a better
 experience for users if we can call native code.
 So we’ve worked for years on a native integration library
 and some wrappers around that
 to pre-bind a bunch of POSIX functions, make it easy to
 call them anytime.
 So does that mean that it makes JRuby on Windows even more
 accessible
 because of the abstraction of those system lib type calls?
 Right, right, exactly.
 So we’re able to match Ruby’s performance exactly the way
 that it would be on any given platform.
 So if there’s platform-specific cores…
 Quarks, not necessarily bugs or problems, but quarks in how
 file operations work
 or quarks in how it deals with unmanaged memory or native
 memory,
 those things we can do without having to write any native
 code.
 We just write a little bit of Java code, call through our
 native integration layer, JNR,
 and we get the native behavior out of that.
 Interesting.
 And on a side note, as we were talking about the JVM,
 it got to me thinking about some of the resources.
 Recent changes, and you may or may not have an answer,
 but with the recent changes in the .NET CLR now being
 launched on OS X and Linux
 and Microsoft seeming to make a push,
 there had been the IAMRuby project that kind of died.
 Have you looked at the .NET stuff
 and looked at how maybe JRuby might benefit from any of
 these new advancements?
 Yeah, actually, for a couple years,
 I went to the lang.net event that Microsoft hosted
 where they had language designers, runtime designers, VM
 folks all come to Redmond
 and meet up and talk about what they’re doing.
 I went with John Rose and did a presentation.
 John Rose is the lead of the Hotspot compiler team.
 We talked about basically how Hotspot works internally,
 what it’s able to do optimization-wise.
 They were able to talk about things that they’re doing in C
 Sharp
 and how it may make it work and how it fits into their VM.
 I really wish we had more.
 More of those events.
 There’s no more lang.net as far as I know.
 We still have the JVM Language Summit
 and get the C Sharp and Microsoft folks over there once in
 a while.
 And there’s events like this that are cross-discipline,
 cross-language.
 So it’s nice.
 I had a chance to talk with Mads a little bit earlier
 about some of the new C Sharp stuff.
 Yeah, and you might not think about an event like this
 might bring together two disparate houses.
 You know, I don’t know which…
 I’ve been watching Dune a little bit too much lately,
 but I’m thinking, you know, which one’s House Harkonnen?
 Yeah, exactly.
 But, you know, I’ll just say JVM is a tradies
 and we’ll just leave it there.
 Or maybe X, I don’t know.
 But it’s good to see, like, some of these advancements
 and it’s good to know that there’s cross-pollination going
 on
 even at a high level of people who are inside of the
 project.
 Right, right.
 Despite the perceived, you know, animosity between the two
 platforms.
 John Rose, I think, mentioned it.
 He said it’s like going to a parallel universe
 where you go and talk to them.
 It’s the same challenges and the same…
 It’s the same problems
 and it just makes sense for us to all work together on them
.
 So, actually, if that means that it’s mirror-mirror,
 you’ve got the goatee.
 So who’s the good guy?
 Yeah, who’s the good me on the other side?
 Well, thank you very much for taking that.
 We’ll leave that as a mystery.
 Thank you very much.</p>

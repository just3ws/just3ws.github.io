    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, I’m Mike. I’m standing here with Amy Kinney from 2ndConf. So, hi Amy. Can you tell me
 a little bit about what 2ndConf is? It’s a conference here in Chicago but beyond that
 I don’t know too much. Sure, I’d love to tell you more about it. 2ndConf is really a conference
 about technologists who are passionate about creating interesting and exciting things.
 So it sort of grew out of the ashes of C4 for people who are familiar with that conference
 but it’s also its own conference in and of itself. This is our third year. We’ve expanded
 every year. We’ve got about 100 attendees. It’s a deliberately small conference so you
 can meet everyone. You can talk to all the presenters. It’s just one of those great things
 where there’s a wonderful community of people who love to come to this every year. We have
 people coming from all over the US as well as internationally. And my husband David Kinney
 and I run the conference and he likes to describe it as the kind of conference that he would
 like to attend if he was attending a conference. So it’s about interesting things, new things
 happening with technology.
 Whether it be iPhone and iPad apps or things happening with Android or Arduino, I mean
 it can kind of span the gamut.
 So there’s more software focused?
 Yes, I mean you will see code examples up there but you’re also going to hear about
 people who are doing really creative things. Our first year, Chris Rojas was there and
 he showed a video with a, let me get this right, it was a trampoline controlled flamethrower
 that utilized Arduino.
 That’s pretty interesting.
 It was, it was.
 Did he demo it on stage?
 He did not.
 Did you guys get a fire code?
 No, no, no, no, he just had the video. So no, no, no flamethrowers actually at the conference.
 Our insurance would be very unhappy with us if we tried to do that.
 Was it a white snake I think it was that?
 No, sorry, none of that either.
 Yeah, no, okay, so you said you’ve been doing this a couple years now. How many years?
 Yes, this is our third year.
 Third year.
 Yes.
 And so looking at running a conference versus like attending, what are some of the things
 you’ve learned?
 Running a conference? What was some, is there anything that kind of surprised you?
 Oh boy, there’s a lot of things. No matter how much planning you do, things will never
 quite go the way that you intend for them to go, but that’s okay. That’s part of the
 nature of the conference. As much planning as you do, you’re still going to end up running
 around like a chicken with your head cut off because things just get crazy. The more you
 do something, the better you get at it. So you learn what things to do in advance, how
 to set things up. But each year presents new challenges. We’re at a new venue this year.
 We had been with Tech Nexus before, but we outgrew the space literally. And so that’s
 exciting to be in a larger conference space. We could have a few more people without getting
 too big.
 Let’s see. Always have backup plans. Backup plans for your backup plans, whether it be
 speakers where people get sick at the last minute or just making sure that if you run
 out of bottled water, you know where the nearest convenience store is to grab things. And part
 of it, one is having a good time. One of the things that I’ve learned over the last couple
 of years is having a great committee of people who work with you. We have a conference committee
 who is really dedicated to helping us and –
 Delegation.
 Yes. Working together and making sure that other people are thinking about things
 that you may forget about.
 Right.
 I think that’s important. And then to have a great group of attendees and people
 who just love to come to the conference, enjoy the time together. And people come to a conference
 for a number of different things to see the speakers, obviously. So having high-quality
 speakers is important.
 But a lot of it is about enjoying the time with other people, getting to meet new people,
 doing new things, having a great time, enjoying great food is one of the things we pride ourselves
 in having great food, too.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Yeah.
 That’s always one of the trickiest things with conferences is what’s the food going
 to be like in –
 Yes.
 – hot versus cold.
 And in fact, that’s really important to us. I have special dietary needs myself. And so
 one of the things we ask everyone is, “What are your special dietary needs?” We check
 in with everyone, make sure that everyone who comes there knows they will be well-fed,
 well taken care of, and their food is going to be safe for them, as well.
 Good.
 So allergies, everything. We have everything from, you know, low-carb diets to, you know,
 allergic to five different things, to vegan, to gluten-free, dairy-free, and everything
 else.
 Now, when you said that you intentionally keep the attendance to a certain size –
 Yes.
 – has that ever become, like, a problem over the last couple of years, where you might
 say, “Oh, we’ve capped it at 100,” but we didn’t have enough people that actually showed
 up because there’s always a nutrition rate, you know?
 There always is a nutrition rate. We do have some people who realized last minute they
 forgot that they bought their tickets, which seems odd to me.
 Most of the time, people can find someone who is willing to buy their ticket. They can
 transfer it over. We sold out in less than two hours this year, and last year it was
 about six hours. So kind of the running joke is that we tend to sell out faster than DubDub
 does.
 What’s that? In three years, you’re going to be like, “Oh, we didn’t even launch
 it. We’re already shut off.”
 I know. We do tell people when we’re selling tickets and when we are going to happen, so
 it’s not like it’s a surprise secret you wake up one morning and we’re sold out. We don’t
 do that. But we haven’t had that happen. We haven’t. We haven’t had that happen. We haven’t.
 But we haven’t had a problem selling out quickly, and everybody loves attending
 our events. So it is always a struggle trying to balance having a small group with making
 sure that enough people can attend. But so far, most of the people who do want to attend
 or put themselves on the waiting list because of attrition and everything, people do tend
 to get in. So if you’re still looking for a ticket, put yourself on the waiting list
 or watch on Twitter because there are always a couple of last minute people who are still
 trying to sell or transfer their tickets.
 Okay.
 for taking the time to talk to me and good luck with the conference. Thank you.</p>

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here again at RailsConf
 2014 and I’m standing here with Justin Collins.
 Justin is going to be doing a talk tomorrow called “Tales
 from the Crypt” but he’s also the creator of the Brakeman
 Gem.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 First, can we start with the Brakeman Gem? Because I’m a
 fan, but I’d like you to describe what it is.
 Sure. So, the Brakeman Gem is a static analysis security
 tool for Ruby on Rails applications.
 So, it looks at your source code, finds potential
 vulnerabilities, and lets you know about them.
 Great. But wait, it’s a dynamic language. How can we do any
 kind of static analysis?
 Oh, boy. So, I’ve talked about that quite a bit.
 You know, the important thing for a security tool is just
 finding stuff.
 And, yes, static analysis security purists may be upset
 because you can’t prove certain things or you can’t analyze
 certain things.
 But for a security tool, it’s really not that important
 that it be perfect, but just that we’re able to identify
 potential problems inside the source code.
 So, it’s kind of like if you, just because you can’t maybe
 identify everything, it doesn’t mean that it’s going to
 work.
 Yeah.
 So, it’s kind of like if you, just because you can’t maybe
 identify everything, it doesn’t mean that it’s going to
 work.
 Yeah.
 So, it’s kind of like if you, just because you can’t maybe
 identify everything, it doesn’t mean that it’s going to
 work.
 Yeah.
 So, it’s kind of like if you, just because you can’t maybe
 identify everything, it doesn’t mean that it’s going to
 work.
 mean you shouldn’t identify exactly exactly so so what kind
 of inspired you to create sov right
 then um it’s kind of a long story but uh basically i got an
 internship on a security team at att
 interactive and i had proposed during my interview
 something like this knowing nothing about security
 or rails or i mean i knew what it was but no experience
 with rails i proposed hey what if
 you just had a tool that found this stuff for you right and
 then they said hey why don’t you work
 on a tool that would find this stuff for us um and they
 were nice enough to allow me to open source
 it at the end of my internship and then i worked for them
 later uh as well on it so so security is
 something that you’re have a passion about um i mean i fell
 into it by accident you know like
 i just happened to get an internship on a security team no
 real uh security experience before that
 but um i you know i’ve been able to create a tool that’s
 been really helpful for people and through
 that tool i’ve gotten into the security community and you
 know i i think as a developer there’s
 always an advantage to being a developer and having
 security knowledge because a lot of times
 the security community is not perceived as being very nice
 people or very smart people sometimes
 by developers who are like i’m just trying to get stuff
 done they’re always blaming me for doing
 things wrong but what they know they don’t even write code
 right right so it’s always good to be
 able to bridge that gap and approach people you know in a
 nice way be a nice person right yeah and
 and you know i’ve liked being able to run the the brickman
 analysis on my gem and and a few other
 you know on my projects a few other uh gems you know along
 those lines of the rails uh best
 practices sure and um and then bullet you know anything
 that can help give a little bit of
 insight into what’s going on in the code is always great
 but i was curious you said you
 can’t cover everything is there something maybe you could
 think of
 that you would like to be able to cover but as a common
 problem it’s just kind of too hard to
 really pin down that developers on rails projects should be
 thinking about um wow that’s a really
 good question um yes i mean there are there are things that
 are difficult to determine statically
 there are some things that it would just take too much time
 to determine and i try to keep
 up to date with the things that i’ve done and i think that
‘s the best way to do it um so i think
 that’s the best way to do it for most people um i think one
 like one good example for example is
 that uh you know you don’t always know what gems are doing
 the breakdown doesn’t look at your
 dependencies um helper methods for example they tend to use
 html safe a lot because maybe they’re
 building out tags and you tend to trust those helper
 methods because somebody wrote it and they
 probably know what they were doing and in your view it
 looks like it’s escaped but actually the
 helper might be setting html safe and building out some
 tags but they’re also putting in user
 input now you have cross-site scripting okay and that’s
 something that brakeman could possibly find
 but uh right now it can’t so so something to look at is
 look at your gems if they’re doing dynamic
 if you’re content generally yeah any kind of content
 generation any kind of oh i’m using this
 helper to generate some html you might want to look into
 that and see what exactly are they doing are
 they properly escaping the values or are they just calling
 html safe and and just jamming it in
 there yeah exactly exactly so it brings me over to your
 talk the uh it’s it’s a group talk but
 it’s tales from the crypt yes and i now i’m presuming that
‘s encryption uh that would be a
 good assumption yeah but we’re actually not going to talk
 about encryption at all okay yes uh well
 it’s a very side note okay um to be honest i didn’t notice
 the pun until after the talk was
 done oh we should have done something uh with this pun yeah
 i have some probably because with
 with open ss all heart bleed stuff encryption is kind of a
 hot topic right now it is a hot topic
 but i think everyone’s kind of aware you know i have very
 non-technical people approach me and say
 hey what about heart bleed like did that affect twitter you
 know did should i do something and
 these are people who are not technical at all and yet they
‘ve heard about it so i don’t think
 probably people at rails
 comp don’t need to hear about it even more right right um
 and that wasn’t the the purpose of our
 talk the purpose of our talk is just um we really we’re
 going to present sort of your your worst
 nightmare one day in the life of a couple developers at a
 company and it’s just like
 one security problem after another okay and just kind of
 trying to demonstrate you know and these
 things happen i mean people find these problems uh people’s
 sites get hacked into and so we’re just
 it’s kind of just a teaching and hopefully we can present
 some proactive steps to prevent these
 really bad days from happening well i’m looking forward to
 your talk and i really appreciate you
 taking the time to speak with me now no problem thank you
 thank you great perfect thank you very
 much yeah man my legs are funny um you know that was uh
 have some pure static analysis
 uh or at least information no so the story i was going to
 tell you
 uh all right so i i worked with uh not directly worked with
 aaron but we sat in proximity to each
 other uh hey group on okay the the first group time the
 first time yes and um user groups with
 lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas
 in the tech community fascinating
 conversations a plethora of information find out for

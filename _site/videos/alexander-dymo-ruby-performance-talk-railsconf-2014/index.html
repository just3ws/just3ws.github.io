    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m at RailsConf 2014 and I’m
 sitting here with
 Alexander Dima, who’s going to be giving a talk this
 afternoon on how to cheaply
 and easily improve your memory footprint for your Ruby
 applications by moving up
 to Ruby 2.1. Thank you for taking time to speak with me.
 Thank you for having me.
 Good to meet you, Mike. So the talk title, I couldn’t quite
 recall it. It’s a long title.
 What is the gist of the talk? So the talk is about two
 things mainly: Ruby 2.1
 and memory optimization. And the gist of my talk is that,
 in fact, what Ruby 2.1
 does is that it optimizes memory for you. Okay. So you can
 do it either yourself
 or you can upgrade to 2.1 or both. Like the copy-on-write
 implementation and things like that?
 Yeah, and most importantly, the generational garbage
 collection, of course.
 Okay, can you kind of maybe explain what those are? Because
 even I have a fumbling
 understanding of what the copy-on-write really does. So
 what copy-on-write does is that if you fork your process,
 you will not have an error.
 If you fork your process, you will not have an error.
 If you fork your process, you will not have an error.
 If you fork your process, you will not have an error.
 If you fork your process, you will not have an error.
 If you fork your process, you will not have an error.
 If you fork your process, you will not have an error.
 If you fork your process, you will not have an error.
 If you fork your process, you will not have an error.
 to copy your memory. So you don’t immediately allocate the
 memory but you don’t? You allocate the memory, you fork
 your process, you have now two processes that use the same
 memory and they use it until you modify it. Okay. And only
 then you actually allocate more memory. Okay, so you’re
 saying, okay, I’m going to fork this process and the VM
 knows, okay, there’s this handle I have to have and then
 you start to write to it and that’s, oh, okay, now I’m
 going to allocate that.
 This is handled by operating system. Oh, it’s by the OS
 level.
 Yes, it’s on the OS level, so you don’t have to do anything
 with this. You just need to be copy and write safe.
 Right. That actually was introduced in 2.0.
 Okay, so if you said you had to be copy and write safe, is
 that something that developers, Rubyists need to change the
 way they go about writing code?
 Not at all.
 They use, of course, C extensions, but not at all. Ruby
 does it for you.
 Okay, so if you’re using native Ruby or the Ruby core, you
‘re going to be fine.
 You’re going to be fine.
 Okay, but if you’re using a gem with C extensions, you
 might want to look at that.
 You might want to investigate more, but usually it’s okay.
 Okay, and you mentioned the garbage collector.
 There’s been arguments recently about, you know, is it
 production ready?
 There’s been kind of a…
 There’s been kind of a snarky article about that.
 You know, maybe you can tell us a little bit more about
 what you’re going to be talking about with the garbage
 collector.
 All right, so, spoiler.
 Before I tell…
 This is going to come out after your talk.
 So, it’s not a spoiler.
 Yeah, what you get from 2.1 is a huge improvement.
 Okay.
 So, it is definitely production ready, and the improvement
 I usually see is about 40% speed up.
 Okay.
 So, for free, yeah.
 Have you dug into what is different about it versus
 previous?
 So, the only difference is how long GC takes, usually.
 So, in old Rubies, you had this huge memory allocated for
 your objects,
 and the garbage collection had to go through all this
 memory
 and see if there are some objects to delete or to collect.
 And in 2.1, it usually goes through only new objects that
 were created after the last GC.
 So, usually, you have a limited set of objects that the
 garbage collection goes through,
 and that’s why it takes less time.
 And in Ruby, it’s called minor GC.
 Okay, minor GC, that’s the new garbage collection program?
 Yeah, so, basically…
 The minor GC is what is collecting new objects,
 and the major GC is the good old-fashioned GC that collects
 everything.
 Just cleans up the hole.
 So, that’s why the garbage collection in 2.1 is actually
 called generational,
 because you have these two generations.
 One is new objects, and another one is old objects.
 Yeah.
 And 2.2 will have three generations, so it will be even
 faster.
 So, what got you digging into the internals of Ruby like
 this?
 Well, we had a bad experience with memory usage.
 For example, if you deploy in Heroku, you have 500 megs
 limit,
 and it’s quite low for Ruby.
 It’s so easy to take 500 megs, and if you do that, there
 are two ways.
 You either stop using Heroku or buy their new PX.
 Yeah, which is like 2 gigs, I think, for Dino.
 It was a large number.
 It’s a large number.
 If you go listen to the interview with Schneems, he says
 the number.
 And, basically, what you don’t want to do is you don’t want
 to spend that much money on hardware.
 So, instead, you can just optimize memory.
 And it’s quite easy to do, actually.
 Yeah.
 You know, looking at…
 It’s…
 Have you done any digging to compare your metrics using
 Ruby 2.1 versus using JRuby?
 Is it something, like, you’ve looked at, or are you fully
 invested in MRI Ruby?
 Yeah, at this point, fully invested in MRI and not really
 wanting to switch.
 Okay.
 The reason is that I wrote several Rails applications,
 Rails 2 application, Rails 3 application,
 and none of them worked with JRuby.
 So, that’s the way it goes for me.
 Okay.
 But I can say I have gotten a few out there, and it’s
 worked for me.
 But everybody’s mileage…
 Yeah, there’s that old saying, everybody’s mileage, and it
 all depends on what we’re doing.
 Yeah, and what we’re using, because I’m using C extensions
 a lot.
 I have proprietary extensions, too.
 That’s why I cannot use JRuby.
 Yeah, that’s why.
 That’s why.
 I’m not quite interested in it.
 So, you have more of an engineering background?
 Yeah.
 More of the DHH, right?
 You actually do have an engineering background.
 Well, if…
 Software engineering.
 If we use DHH’s classification, yeah, it’s software
 engineering.
 We’ll just leave it at that.
 But you’ve obviously been digging into C code for a while.
 Yeah.
 Has that really helped you with your Ruby understanding?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So, you can look at it and be like, oh, okay, I see what
 the abstractions are.
 Right.
 And I’ve actually done a lot of C++ programming in the past
, and I enjoyed that, unlike most people.
 You were a different breed then.
 Yeah.
 So, that’s why I’m, okay, when I see the problem with Ruby,
 I just go ahead and read the source codes.
 Yeah.
 That’s what I did.
 So, again, going to kind of what the theme of the original
 keynote was, is the reading of the source code.
 Yeah.
 And having, you know, building up some additional skills
 outside of simply being a Rubyist.
 You know, not just saying, oh, I’m a Rubyist, and I know
 Ruby, but knowing how some of that lower level languages
 works.
 It’s been…
 It’s worth the investment.
 It is a good investment, definitely, because you come to
 understand how it works.
 Yeah.
 And why it behaves the way it behaves.
 Yeah.
 That’s important when we optimize things.
 It’s, like, they’re really optimizing you to understand why
 it is slow.
 Right.
 Without the ASU, you just cannot optimize.
 Yeah.
 And avoid the cargo culting.
 Yeah.
 Because that was, I do understand that also the memory,
 like the old Twitter environment variables that people
 would use to override the garbage collector,
 or memory, or the number of objects that could be allocated
 between garbage collection.
 But that’s also been fixed in 2.0 or 2.1.
 2.1 actually increased memory limits.
 Yeah.
 So, like, most people do not want to tweak these variables
 anymore.
 And what I’ve seen recently that some people do, and they
 do it in the wrong way.
 Right.
 So, if you have that, those old GC environment variables,
 and you’re upgrading to 2.1,
 you might want to look at taking those out, or determining
 what they are, the new defaults are.
 Yeah.
 And then, like, that’s the part of my talk.
 Yeah.
 About new defaults, and, like, do you really want to change
 them?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 And, by the way, speaking about cargo cult, another way
 that Ruby community, especially Rails community, don’t want
 to learn is SQL.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And, like, come on, SQL has been there for 40 years, and
 web frameworks, come and go, come and go, and SQL is still
 here.
 And it’s such a good investment.
 If you want to improve your performance as well.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s still sitting on the porch, given
 the old, those little web frameworks that are rolling by,
 and they’re skating boards, and they’re roller shoes.
 Yeah, I understand that using Cameral sounds cool, but, at
 the end, it’s the same plain old SQL, but written in Ruby.
 Right.
 It’s generating the SQL.
 Yeah, it’s generating.
 Just like, you know, you’re…
 Yeah.
 People complain about using CoffeeScript, because they say,
 oh, it’s just generating JavaScript, but a long time ago,
 people were saying, oh, why am I using the ORM?
 It’s just generating SQL.
 Mm-hmm.
 And, you know, there’s pros and cons to that.
 Yeah, right.
 Okay, you can write code a little bit faster now with the
 ORM, but we’ve forgotten about SQL.
 I wonder if that’s going to be the future with all these
 abstractions on JavaScript.
 We’re going to have people that don’t even know JavaScript,
 because they only know these abstractions.
 I don’t know.
 It’s a question.
 It’s a question.
 Maybe we’ll find out in the next 20 years.
 Well, it’s more like not a question of whether you need to
 choose between two, but you’d rather use both.
 Right.
 When appropriate.
 And, like, some things are just not good to do in Ruby, and
 Ruby will take enormous time to do calculations, for
 example, if you have large data sets.
 Mm-hmm.
 So, that’s why you should not forget completely about.
 Right.
 Because this is the thing you want to use at some point.
 I’m not going to say that, okay, just forget about Active
Record.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Do not use any models.
 No, it’s have a toolbox, and have more than one tool.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 You just need to have several tools.
 Sometimes you just need a hammer.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 I really appreciate it.
 Thank you very much for having me.
 Thanks.
 Thanks.
 User groups with lots to say.
 Interviews and more.
 No way.

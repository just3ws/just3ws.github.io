      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here again at GOTO Conf
 2014, and well, this
 interview is a little different than most of them, where I
‘ve talked with
 people that maybe are in the community that I don’t
 necessarily know, but Ryan
 Gary here is a friend of mine who’s been, we’ve co-organ
ized user groups together,
 we’ve known each other, we’ve been to each other’s houses,
 and you know, our
 kids have played together, but we met at a conference, much
 like GOTO Conf.
 You’re at SCNA 2009, Software craftsmanship North America.
 I can
 remember you were sitting at the table, and I walked up to
 him like, “Hi, I’m Mike.
 Where are you from?” Because I just wanted to engage with
 somebody, and it turned out we live in the same neck of the
 woods. Yeah, which is
 fairly uncommon. Yeah. Usually it’s someone who either
 lives in like the city, which
 is far from us, or they live in another state, so it’s like
, “What? You live like 15
 minutes from my house?” But it was just that chance, you
 know, that when you
 open yourself up at a conference, and that’s kind of what I
‘m getting at, is
 when you open yourself up to these opportunities, you never
 know what’s going
 to come out of them, but at one moment, we didn’t know each
 other, and then now we’re
 you know, here years later, having run a user group
 together, and you know, been
 friends for a while. So I would normally say, “Thank you
 for taking the time to
 speak with me,” but I don’t have to thank you, but no,
 thank you for taking the
 time to be on the camera, though. So Ryan, right now you’re
 the one that’s leading
 up SCMC. SCMC is a group we started together. It’s Software
 Craftsmanship McHenry County, but for the last
 year or plus, you’ve been kind of running it solo. How’s it
 going?
 Good, good! I’m not completely running it solo, so Mike Ros
selli is
 helping me as well. I need to bring in more people, so user
 groups
 are great. It’s been going well. What I find is that I will
 have a backlog of
 like three topics lined up, and then we’ll get to that
 backlog, and then I’ll
 have a month where it’s like, “Oh boy, I don’t have
 anything.” So yeah, like I need to
 pull something out and just make something up, which has
 worked before.
 You can have really good discussions, and we had one of
 those back in November,
 and it went really well, but it’s kind of like feast or
 famine, and you have to
 constantly be keeping that backlog going. So having a
 bigger
 leadership team helps with that problem. Yeah, because you
 can split the net a
 little bit. Yeah, exactly. And that’s one of the things is
 that the SCMC is a
 far suburban group. It is, yeah. Yeah, so we live in the
 Chicago metropolitan area,
 and there’s a ton of user groups in downtown Chicago. There
 are some user
 groups spread around the suburbs, but Mike and I live
 pretty far northwest of
 the city. About 50-60 miles off the city. Yeah, and there
 were no technical user
 groups out there, but there are a decent amount of
 developers out there, because
 people move there because it’s affordable housing, whatever
 reason. You know, the whole point
 for me of the group was really to foster that local
 development community, because I
 think it so easily gets overshadowed with what’s happening
 in downtown Chicago, and
 it’s really about, you know, establishing those
 relationships between the people
 in that area. Yeah, yeah, there was, I mean, there’s Foll
ett that is out there, which
 is a very large library services company. In education. In
 education,
 and then before there was TicketsNow, which is now being
 consumed by Ticketmaster,
 moved away, but there’s still a lot of developers that live
 out that way then,
 that are, they commute in, or they work, and then there’s
 no real community around
 technical. Yeah, so originally Mike and I started the group
. Mike did the most of
 the initial setup, and it was originally, the topic was
 cloud development, cloud
 computing, and yeah, we did that for what, about a year and
 a half? Yeah, and then
 just, we ran out of topics, and we’re like, yeah, let’s do
 something different, and so we kind of have that. And that
 was like 2009,
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, 2010 is when we first had our first SCMC
 meeting, and then we
 brought Jim in from 8th Light. Yeah, Jim Suchy from 8th
 Light. And that was the first time we actually had
 like a corporate sponsor, so that’s what Follett sponsored
 our location, and that
 helped out a lot. Yeah, yeah. And you know, Follett would
 also sponsor food, 8th Light would sponsor food,
 you were working at Groupon at the time, they would sponsor
 food, so having like that, that corporate
 support was a really, really big help. The other thing that
 really increased our attendance at
 meetings was when we switched to meetup.com. Right, yeah.
 Which was surprising, because you know,
 we wouldn’t expect that that would have that dramatic
 impact, it really did, I want to say
 like a 50% increase. Well, discoverability. Yeah, yeah,
 yeah. You know, and they do some help with,
 if you’re already a member for one group, they send you
 alerts. They’ll suggest, yeah. For areas,
 stuff that might be near you or in your interests. And meet
up.com auto-nags people to come
 to your user group when it gets closer to the date, so that
‘s helpful too. Yeah. So, yeah, so
 and that actually, even though we didn’t have a corporate
 sponsor for the cloud developers group,
 we met at a Panera, we met at a local bar, the first
 meeting was at a library, but you know,
 but that was okay. Yeah, yeah. You know, that was, we had
 to power through that. We did. You know,
 it wasn’t always easy, it was sometimes quite painful, but
 you know, it goes into something that I’ve been talking
 about, about building community in 24 months. And one of
 those things is it doesn’t really matter
 where you meet, because when you’re trying to build a
 community, it’s not necessarily that
 you’re at a Follett or at a Groupon or at an A-Flight. Yeah
. It’s like you’re just somewhere
 where people get together and talk shop, talk about
 whatever, talk about whatever is on their
 mind with, with, with a community and can speak a similar
 language and feel some empathy toward
 each other because we share common interests and industry.
 But now you’re, you’re kind of expanding
 and you’re doing another new informal meetup. So you’re,
 you’ve got the bug for, for organizing.
 What is this little, you’ve been doing a coffee, kind of
 like a Coden coffee kind of thing.
 Yeah. So I, let me tell you the history of that. So I
 started working from home about three years ago,
 full-time and I was working with people also like in, in
 our area and we would just get together to
 work at coffee shops. And since then, like that group that
 I was working with has spread apart
 and you know, we’re working for different companies, but it
‘s still really nice to get to
 that group together still to this day and like hang out at
 a coffee shop, see how we’re doing,
 you know, even, even like we’ll collaborate on, on
 technology things. So so yeah, I have become the
 social director of a coffee shop. Yeah.
 Of the informal McHenry county meetup at a coffee shop
 group.
 Great acronym. So just a bunch of letters, just throw it in
.
 I probably should formalize it and even, even put it on
 meetup.com,
 but that’s kind of what I’ve done so far.
 But it goes to show like how you can do community in, in a
 variety of ways.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 And, and, and even can just foster those relationships that
 we have at work.
 Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And
 I think a lot of motivation for me behind the coffee shop
 stuff is I actually heard on a podcast
 like five years ago that there was this small city, like a
 hundred miles outside of Paris.
 And a lot of people worked from home and worked from
 wherever their company was in a major
 European city, but they had this coworking space where they
 would get together for half the day,
 just so they had that camaraderie. So that’s, you know,
 living in McHenry county,
 you either have an extreme commute or you work,
 work locally or you work from home. So like having that,
 that attachment to the communities is really helpful.
 Right. All right. Well, Ryan,
 I’ll see you in a few minutes, but thanks for taking the
 time to chat on camera. It’s been
 too long. Yeah. Thanks.
 Thank you. All right. Bye.

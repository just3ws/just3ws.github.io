    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2014. I
‘m sitting here with John and Coleman who
 gave a talk on building an ecosystem. Well, thank you very
 much for taking the time to speak with
 me. Can you tell me a little bit about what your talk was
 and what does it mean to build an
 ecosystem? Sure. Well, we focused on building a program of
 different products that made this
 grocery and restaurant store really get off the ground in a
 short amount of time. And so that
 meant a collection of bespoke built software and products
 for that need, but also purchasing things
 off the shelf, tweaking them and customizing them for the
 client. And then we also built the services
 that stitch all of those together. So was that like a live
 coding thing or were you mostly walking
 through? So yeah, it was a series of
 stories.
 The different products that we built and different
 challenges we faced with kind of the general theme
 that we didn’t need to have all the problems figured out up
 front. What we had was a good
 process and that helped us figure out the problems as they
 arose. So that spanned all the way from
 technical to experience side problems. Yeah. So part of our
 talk was how we
 switched between agile and lean principles as we needed to,
 to accomplish those different goals.
 Okay. And, you know, the word ecosystem, and this is kind
 of a theme we’ve,
 have very loaded terminology in this conference. I’ve
 noticed that is that ecosystem can mean a lot
 of different things. What do you mean by ecosystem?
 Oh, that’s a tough question. I think I see it. And I think
 we both will have answers to this. I see it
 very much almost as a living, breathing program. Like I
 think why it, why it means ecosystem to me
 is because if we have an established program and we add
 something to it, it doesn’t mean that we’re
 going to have a solution. It doesn’t become as simple as
 making another product or tool. What
 you have to do then is tweak something in every other
 element to best integrate that and make it
 all flow together. And because all of these things become
 intertwined and dependent on each other,
 and, and because they change as a whole rather than an
 individual, that’s why it means ecosystem
 to me. Yeah, it, it really, the distinction is that iter
ative doesn’t mean piecemeal,
 right? So we need to change something in one product. Often
 that would have ripples and we had a lot of
 different products to ultimately serve this large
 restaurant space, as well as a lot of operational
 needs on the, on the client backend. So when we changed one
 product, for example, the quick payment
 app that we met made, what that meant is we also needed to
 change things about the physical space.
 We needed to change things about the way our web services
 consume that information. And that’s why
 it’s an ecosystem, not just a collection of products.
 Right. So, so this isn’t simply just a matter of, oh, I
 need a blog, bring in WordPress.
 It’s more of what, what is it that this, this company is
 trying to do with this specific product?
 What’s our end need and which services can we just pull in
 or do we have to create? Like,
 how do you decide whether to go with the create versus
 build versus buy?
 Well, I think, you know, uh, one of the key components to
 that was we had
 a really strong strategy and product management team. Um,
 and everyone participated in that. So
 it was certainly led by people with experience in that
 field. Um, but we were all integrated
 into those choices. And so we made really intentional calls
 when we would. So for example,
 we bought the POS system, um, we licensed revel and
 customized it for our client as an iPad point
 of sale system. Yeah. Um, and then, but we did build those
 services from scratch and we built,
 uh, the market pass app from scratch, um, which works with
 rebel. And so we really also put those
 together and made them play off of each other. So there’s a
 lot more of, it’s more glue than
 that’s, that’s the bespoke code or I think you have to
 build the glue as well. So it’s like,
 it’s not like doing just WordPress. Yeah. It’s like, you
 also have to build the browser, right?
 Okay. So it can be, it really depends on, um, what the need
 of that specific
 customer. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And the, the value of
 building the glue to extend that metaphor
 is that when we realize that there is something that we can
‘t buy that we need to really kind
 of complete an experience or complete a specific flow, we
 can then build that and know that we’ll
 integrate well. So, and I think, uh, something that might
 make this context a bit clearer is
 that we were building these series of products for a
 physical space. So you can even technically
 think of them just like real objects, right? Because it was
 for a restaurant grocery hybrid,
 all of these things actually went somewhere and were picked
 up in touch by people weren’t
 necessarily invisible. Well, so this even, it, it led to
 decisions about
 who might be doing your, your supply for groceries and
 things like that. Not just,
 not just which software do you use for the point of sale or
 for the menu online system,
 but actually how do you get the materials to cook the food
 to send to, you know, to serve
 your customers. We realized, um, towards the end of the
 program that, uh, we had the customers as
 a user base, but we also have the associates, the people
 who are actually working there as a user
 base. And we ended up spinning up an entire another stream
 of work around training and self-service
 tools to let the.
 Associates do the best that they could to best serve the
 customers, right? Because the whole
 goal was to use technology to empower a great customer
 experience. And sometimes that meant
 just empowering other humans to help with that. Right. And,
 uh, so this sounds like it’s a lot
 more like a few years ago then like Yahoo pipes. And there
‘s, if then this, if this,
 then that’s kind of in interactions between different
 services and APIs,
 this is a lot further beyond that. And it goes into more of
 the depth of actually building.
 I’m going to have to edit that one out because I can’t even
 think.
 Building a store.
 Building a store.
 I mean, it’s building a store.
 Building a physical place that is integrated with
 technology.
 This is going beyond just, oh, I have a website, and I’m
 going to maybe do some dropshipping.
 And it’s how that website affects what’s going on in the
 store, how those apps affect what’s going on in the store.
 Is there anything that, you know, when you came out of this
 product and you’re now looking back and you’re going to
 write this presentation,
 what were some of the highlight things that were kind of
 really surprised you or you learned
 and that you wanted to share in this presentation?
 Like, was there one thing in particular that…
 Oh, that’s a hard question.
 I’ll give you two things.
 Well, you do one, I’ll do one.
 Okay.
 I think one of my favorite things is that we released the
 Rich Tree app, which is currently in the iOS and Android
 store.
 We also released an actual plastic card version of this app
.
 What I’m quite proud of is that we created both a very
 accessible version, which is free, and anyone can pick up.
 And this wooden card will act as your loyalty card.
 Requires no technology.
 Right.
 So we don’t always need to use tech to solve problems, but
 we were able to create a super accessible and free item,
 which contained our core value proposition without eroding
 the value that the mobile app created.
 The mobile app allows you to do things in more real time.
 It also allows you to pay.
 Okay.
 And also…
 It also uses the core feature of loyalty.
 So we didn’t have to compromise on the value of either of
 those, and we’re able to basically create something for the
 super connected user
 and leverage that tech to have a stronger store experience.
 But we didn’t compromise on the core value prop by having a
 very accessible and free wooden card that you can come in
 and take.
 So it sounds like you recognize that maybe the be-all, end-
all isn’t to force technology onto people.
 Absolutely.
 It’s just a dress that sometimes people just like.
 You have a thing.
 You could be as exact as, you know, we realized not
 everyone had an unlimited data plan.
 Right.
 Like, we just realized things would go wrong, and you
 shouldn’t be forced to have to do all these things to
 access some of our great tech.
 Great.
 And you were going to say…
 Oh, yeah.
 So mine actually was the…
 We built an app, an iPad app, that was all of our menus for
 the restaurant that was for the bar.
 So the restaurant is generally basically a food court where
 all of the stations,
 or in fact, owned by the same restaurant, except for the
 bar, which is a full-service bar, table service, everything
 else.
 And they can also order from any of the other stations.
 And we became so well-known, essentially, for being pivot-
friendly in the way that we were doing things,
 that they came to us 10 hours before store launch, like
 store first opening, and said,
 we need a menu for the bar.
 And we were able to, because of the way we had built
 everything,
 because of the way that we were considering the entire
 experience,
 and knew that we were…
 going to be wrong and going to be learning up until opening
 day,
 that it was kind of a ridiculous request, but it was
 actually doable.
 We managed to, because we could just consume the same web
 services,
 because we could use the same exact styling that was used
 in the menu boards and elsewhere with a few tweaks,
 we were able to actually get this thing out the door,
 which was not only kind of put the cherry on top of this
 holistic user experience,
 that used technology not as kind of your flashbang.
 We were in an Apple store.
 We weren’t selling technology.
 We were selling food.
 We were selling good customer service.
 And that was kind of one of the last things that really
 felt good in kind of,
 we are actually empowering our customers to really have a
 great time here,
 to enjoy the food, not to look at the app, but to know what
 food they can buy, quite literally.
 And I have to even wonder if that ability to deliver such a
 time-sensitive solution
 helped build more trust from your direct clients,
 and know that…
 Absolutely.
 It’s part of how we got the request in the initial spot.
 I mean, we had to really earn the right to be their tech
 partner.
 We didn’t walk in.
 It wasn’t based strictly on our brand.
 They didn’t come in and ask us to just take charge of all
 of these things.
 We earned it over time.
 And the Lean and Agile process helped us to really do that,
 because we were able to make
 changes based on their changing business needs, because
 they had a six-month deadline.
 This store was going to open whether our tech was ready or
 not.
 Yeah.
 We had to hit that construction deadline, and they didn’t
 have everything figured out.
 And so, they needed a group like us that could change over
 time, where they didn’t have to
 present us with all of the answers to get started.
 Great.
 And just to close, you said that there is an app on the iOS
 store that people can go
 and check out to kind of see what…
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 If you search Rich Tree, R-I-C-H-T-R-E-E, it’ll come up.
 Unfortunately, if you don’t live in Toronto, it’ll be
 pretty much useless.
 But like I said, the technology is in service of the
 customer experience, which means if
 you’re not in the store, the app, which I can actually show
 you, the app, which looks
 like that…
 Sure.
 I’ll hold it up.
 Yeah.
 It’s a…
 So, it’s a quick pay barcode.
 A QR code there.
 Exactly.
 Yeah.
 Which means that if I’m not in the store, this app is
 basically useless.
 Right.
 Which is the point.
 We didn’t make an app that you could play with, because we
‘re not…
 This company doesn’t sell apps.
 They sell food.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 It was really interesting.
 Great.
 Thanks so much.
 Thanks.
 User groups with lots to say.
 Interviews and more.
 No way.
 Sharing great ideas in the tech community.
 Fascinating conversations.

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015 and I
‘m standing here with
 Mads Torgersen who talked about the future of C#. Thank you
 very much for
 taking the time to speak with me. So the future of C#, what
 is what’s in a
 crystal ball? Well they’re a bundle of things that are in
 the very near future
 of C#, which means we release in a couple of months. We
 just put out a
 release candidate for it. One being several language
 features for C#
 itself, which are all sort of in the category of helping
 clean up the code
 and remove boilerplate and so on. Pretty lightweight
 features, if you will, but
 should make everybody’s code look nicer. The signatures of
 funk and types and T
 are gonna go away? Well some things are, a lot of member
 declarations will get
 shorter. We’ll have shorthands for what we call the null
 conditional operator
 where lots more null checks become implicit. We have, you
 know, various
 little features that just make your code safer and nicer in
 various ways.
 Lots of little features. And that’s kind of not the most
 exciting thing
 that’s happening with C# actually. The main thing I think
 is that
 we’re sort of almost putting out a new kind of tech, like
 sort of a language
 engine. We call it Project Roslyn. That is, at the core it
‘s a compiler, so
 it’s something that understands. It’s the thing that we
 build our compiler with.
 It’s also underlying the tooling experience in Visual
 Studio, so it’s a
 very deep language understanding engine, if you will. It’s
 both good at compiling
 with high throughput to, you know, to some executable, but
 it’s also really good
 at being, sitting behind an ID and being reactive at a
 typing speed while answering
 all kinds of deep questions about the code. And it’s also
 good at performing custom analysis
 that people write for it. And this is one of the things
 that I think is really exciting
 about it is that it provides a complete and efficient API
 on top of the whole language
 that people can write to. And they can write, you know,
 batch static analysis over it. That’s
 very high fidelity. They can also write plug-ins that run
 in real time as you type and give
 you squiggles. Where they think, “Oh, this is going to take
 a long time.” So, you know,
 they can do that. Where they think that your code is wrong,
 offer suggestions for fixes
 that can be executed.
 So, lots of introspection type things.
 Sort of, you could call it compile time introspection. So,
 it’s that, it’s giving
 that ability to deeply understand the language. It’s
 putting that in the hands of people who
 want to enhance the tool in a very easy fashion. And so, I
 think, you can, for instance, imagine
 people who write APIs and share them out, whether within a
 company or publicly or whatever.
 What you could do now is to ship analyzers with your API
 that will help them, you know,
 that will help people use the API in the right way. Saying,
 “Don’t call it like this. Call
 it like this or use it in this sequence.” It can, you know,
 people can write very simple
 logic that discovers those patterns in people’s code and
 give them real time feedback saying,
 “Here’s how you should rather do it. Click the light bulb
 and I’ll fix it for you.”
 So, like, instead of just comments about deprecations, it
 could be like, “Oh, this method is old.”
 And that could be something that could be surfaced through
 the IDE.
 Certainly. Any pattern, essentially, we have this hardened
 immutable object model of code
 that we present to whoever wants to take advantage of it,
 want to plug in and take advantage of
 it. And they can look for whatever pattern they want in the
 code. So, tactically, semantically,
 following the static bindings, they can ask about all those
 things of the compiler in
 real time as advanced as they want it to and give immediate
 feedback to the compiler. So,
 to the eventual user of the IDE who’s using that plugin.
 Interesting.
 It’s actually very, it’s a very, it sort of opens a lot of
 doors for new tooling
 experiences, much more tailored tooling experiences,
 depending on your environment, depending on
 what libraries you use and so on, than people have had in
 the past.
 Interesting. And, you know, to kind of move over to some of
 the advancements in portability
 for the CLR, we’re looking at the recent release of the
 Visual Code and, you know,
 in promotion of running .NET code on non-Microsoft servers.
 How does this play into the Roslyn
 story?
 Well, it does play very nicely together. First of all, the
 Roslyn source code is in
 C#.
 Right.
 So, the fact that C# runs, is going to run well on Linux
 and on Mac means that, well,
 the C# language engine is going to run well there. So, now
 we can support, people can
 use that engine to support IDE integration.
 Visual Studio Code, for instance, does make use of that,
 where the way that the language
 engine runs with the IDE is not actually running inside of
 the IDE, but is running as a separate
 process on your Linux box, for instance. It’s a surface
 that runs on the box or anywhere
 else, but then the latency issues creep in.
 And then it just speaks a protocol, you know, through a
 pipe with the IDE and that’s a thin,
 long integration layer in the IDE.
 Is that the OmniSharp?
 The OmniSharp, exactly.
 Okay, yeah.
 Yes. So, it uses OmniSharp for that integration. And OmniS
harp is also, it’s a great open project
 actually, with Microsoft participation, but driven by the
 community. It lets it easily
 integrate with a ton of different IDEs.
 Yeah, I’ve seen it for Vim, like hooking into OmniSharp
 with Vim and it kind of opens
 up.
 Right, it’s a blind text and so on. There’s a long list if
 you go to the website. So,
 enabling technology for all of that to happen.
 Interesting, yeah. And so, are you looking at other
 products, like Mono, who had been
 on non-dotnet runtimes? It’s because of this now open Ros
lyn project. Is there more communication
 with Mono?
 Absolutely. We have this formal entity now called the dot
net foundation, of which both
 Microsoft and Mono and many others are members. And these
 projects are undertaken under that
 foundation, if you will. So, essentially, you can think of
 dotnet on Linux and on Mac.
 You sort of think of them as the next version of Mono, if
 you will. The source code is primarily
 derived from the Microsoft source codes for Windows, but
 they are essentially the next
 version, being more robust and more tailored for sort of a
 modernâ€¦
 It brings me to even thinking about Office 365 and how it
 seemed like earlier resistance
 from the Office team to adopt dotnets, because they had
 their legacy code base with all the
 Win32 and C++ for optimized speed. But now, Office 365
 seems to be really getting some
 serious traction. And I’m presuming that’s powered by ASP.
NET.
 On Roslyn, are you working with some of these product teams
 internally to identify?
 There’s not a specific connection between those two things.
 I think they’re more expressive
 of a similar trend where we are happy to take our business
 to any platform.
 Well, I was just seeing more of how dotnet might be
 becoming more important to the overall
 strategy inside of Microsoft, and looking beyond the
 Microsoft desktop platform and
 saying, “Okay, we have this tool inside that’s
 doing this amazing stuff for ASP.NET. Let’s shore that up
 and make it even stronger.”
 I mean, is that even within any kind of strategy
 discussions you guys are working on?
 So the way to look at it is not so much that dotnet is the
 linchpin of everything we do
 to push into other platforms or to work in other places in
 the cloud or whatever. It’s
 really just one of the things that we’re opening up. We’ve
 stopped thinking about
 Windows as the only platform for things, and that goes
 across the board. Sometimes
 dotnet is enabling technology for that, and sometimes it’s
 something else. Some things
 work at the JavaScript level, cross-platform. Some things
 are actually, there’s a ton of
 C++ code that gets ported that’s a little harder to get to
 work cross-platform, but
 it’s not impossible. And so it’s not that dotnet is sort of
 like
 the thing that we’re shoving everything through or building
 everything on as we kind of expand
 into new places.
 Well, yeah, because I remember when dotnet came out and the
 original marketing push was
 that dotnet is the future, and then it seemed like there
 was kind of a winnowing of, like,
 okay, dotnet really is just for server stuff, but now it
 seems like, okay, now we’re going
 to expand what dotnet can be used for.
 Yeah, I don’t think we ever, like, thought, we didn’t think
 of dotnet as only for server
 stuff. I think it just, it’s just one of those technology
 choices. If you’re looking at efficiency,
 systems-level efficiency, you’re going to pick C++. It’s
 still going to be faster than
 dotnet or Java or whatever. If you’re looking at the reach
 that you can get on the web,
 for instance, well, you’ll pick JavaScript, even though you
 don’t have the same productivity
 and performance that you do in C#. For that vast space in
 the middle, C# is a really good
 choice. And that’s regardless of whether it’s in the cloud
 or on on-prem servers or whether
 it’s a client app. Like, if you look at our own…
 App ecosystem, most things are written in C# on Windows.
 And we don’t have a Microsoft
 offering. Microsoft, or Samurai is our close partner in
 offering C#-based development on
 other client platforms. So you can kind of pretty much take
 it in any direction you want.
 I don’t think we ever thought of it as not being for the
 whole range of clients, from
 client to server. It was more that we kind of focused all
 that energy in the Windows
 space only.
 Yeah. Well, personally, as a developer, I developed on
 Microsoft platforms for a decade
 and moved to Ruby on Rails. But now what I’ve seen, I was
 one of the people that was tweeting,
 “Wow,” when Visual Studio and Visual Code came out. And it
‘s kind of exciting to look
 at ways to be able to take those old skills and apply them
 in a broad space.
 It’s an exciting time to be working at Microsoft as well,
 because we really have opened up
 a lot. And we’re…
 Not only becoming available on a much broader range of
 platforms, we’re also doing it much
 more in the open. The open sourcing has been really
 exciting. The direct contact with the
 user community, the contributions that we get through that,
 both in terms of proposals
 and discussions and down to code contributions on our .NET
 Core CLR and framework there,
 and to Roslyn itself, the compiler engine, if you will.
 That’s just staggering and amazing.
 Yeah. It’s really great.
 It’s very cool. Even from the outside, it’s really cool to
 see that those changes
 taking place. Well, thank you very much for taking the time
 to speak with me.
 Thanks. That’s great.
 Appreciate it. Thank you.</p>

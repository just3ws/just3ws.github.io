    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2014. I
‘m standing here with
 Rhino Corey, founder of MetaDeveloper, and she is here
 doing introductions for
 the speakers for several of the presentations. Thank you
 very much for
 taking the time to speak with me. So, your relationship
 with GOTO Conf, how
 did you end up coming here and doing these introductions
 and the opening
 warm-up for these speakers? Well, there was a long way
 leading to that. So, it all
 started in Denmark, in the Middle East Kingdom of Northern
 Europe, where there
 was a company called Triforce who wanted to go to a lot of
 conferences in the US
 to see a lot of the great speakers, but they couldn’t
 afford it. So, what they
 decided to do instead was to create their own conference.
 So, it started there in Denmark in 1996, and in 1998, it
 had grown to become a bit
 larger, and at that time, I just started my PhD in computer
 science, and I was
 working with programming languages and design patterns and
 correspondence
 between those two, and they invited me as a PhD student in
 their PhD track to talk
 about what I was going to do, what I was planning to do. So
, you came in as a
 presenter? Yes, that was the way I started. I
 was, yeah, in a special track for PhD students. So, not on
 the tracks where we
 have Martin Fowler and Jess Humboldt, but… Real stuff. No
, not like that. I was not a
 professional speaker at that time, so I presumably wasn’t a
 very good speaker
 at that time. Anyway, so I finished my PhD, and I started
 doing teaching at University
 and also in industry at Triforce, and then they offered me
 a job after my PhD. So, I
 started working for them in 2001, and one of my first tasks
 was to do a
 tutorial about software architecture for the conference,
 and also to help out
 inviting some of the speakers. So, over the years, I’ve
 been working on and off
 with Triforce and University, but all the time I’ve been
 helping out with the
 conference in Denmark, inviting speakers, and now I’ve
 become the PC chair for
 many of the conferences that we do, because now it’s not
 only in Denmark, it’s in
 here in Chicago. I’m also involved in a JAO conference in
 Australia, QCon London.
 So, you’re all over. Go to Berlin, Amsterdam. Yes. Yeah,
 that’s a lot of
 flying. It’s a lot of flying, yes. But it’s very
 interesting to be part of the
 program committee, because you get the chance to spend some
 time and look at
 what are the trends, and see a lot of talks, and who are
 the good speakers, who
 could talk about this, talk about that. So, preferably, of
 course, we want speakers
 who’ve done something special, so that their name is well-
known, or they’re
 the brand, at least, is well-known, but also that they’re
 really, really good
 speakers, entertaining, and can make people listen to what
 they’re saying. And
 actually, also, on the third part, we’d like them to be
 great people to be
 around, because we like our conferences to be a cozy area.
 Social. Yeah, social, where the
 participants and the speakers can communicate with each
 other. That’s also
 why we do not have a speaker room. We do not want to hide
 them away from the
 participants. Yeah, so the idea is that everybody is out
 and mingling and meeting. Yeah, exactly.
 But to do the presentations, you said you started off as a
 PhD. Did you say you
 were a student when you first came? Yeah. So, when you were
 a PhD student doing a
 presentation, now you’re doing warm-ups and introducing,
 which, as you described,
 you want people that are friendly. Well, you kind of want
 somebody that’s going to be a
 little bit funny to do warm-ups. How did you go from being
 this uncomfortable
 person, maybe a little bit, doing their first talk, to now
… Loving to be on stage. Yeah.
 Loving to be on stage and having a little bit of a
 performance. Yeah. I don’t know, it
 came little after little. I remember the first really big
 presentation I gave was
 at the Uppsala conference in ‘98. It was one of the papers
 I had accepted, and I
 was so nervous, and I rehearsed it so many times. But now,
 it’s more
 natural to me. I know basically what I want to say, and
 then when I get on
 stage, I sometimes say something completely different. But
 I just enjoy
 being there. So I don’t know, it’s practice. Were you
 always somebody that liked being on stage? Did you do any
 drama or anything when you were in school? No. No? Just
 once you got bit by the bug?
 Yes. It was… I’ve always been a shy child, never wanted
 to have any attention when
 I was a child, and now I love it. And, you know, actually
 it’s interesting. I talked
 with some people who, when they go on the stage, they’re
 very gregarious and open,
 kind of like a Bob Martin, Uncle Bob. And then when they’re
 offstage, they’re a little bit more reserved,
 and soft-spoken, or maybe not necessarily Bob Martin. But
 so the
 point is, is that when you get on a stage, they’re able to
 put on a persona,
 and then when they come back, they’re able to be themselves
 again. Is that
 something you do, or do you feel a lot more like your
 personality on stage
 is the same as offstage, or is it melded? I definitely
 think that there’s a
 change. That’s also why sometimes I don’t really know what
 I’m going to say when
 I’m on stage, because I sort of change into somebody who
 wants to be there and have attention
 and when I come down from the stage again, I’m just myself.
 Yeah, does it feel like kind of exhilarating, or a little
 bit like, “Oh, that was depleting”?
 No, I’m high about an hour after I’ve been on stage, and
 then I deflate.
 And then it’s, “Oh, that was tiring.” Yes, right. I think I
 use a lot of energy on it.
 Okay, and so the presentations here at GOTO Conf, who were
 you introducing? So in the
 morning introductions, I just share with Dave Thomas. I
 introduce half of them, and he
 introduces the other half of them, and now I’m track
 hosting also for some of
 the sessions. Like this afternoon, I’m track hosting for,
 for instance, Greg
 Young. Yesterday, I was track hosting for Michael Nygaard,
 Randy Shoup, and Jess Humble, so…
 What is track hosting? Oh, that means that you are hosting
 a track in the
 room, so all the speakers that are coming there are sort of
 your responsibility. You need
 to make sure that they’re there, and you need to introduce
 them so they know when to start
 talking, and you need to help them stop talking when they
 should stop talking, and you get
 their slides for the website. So it’s a little bit of an MC
, kind of.
 It is. So, MC, I know.
 Yes. Well, thank you very much for taking the
 time to speak with me. I really appreciate it. Thank you.
 Oh, actually, you know what? I do want to ask one more
 thing.
 Okay. Is there, for somebody who’s looking at presenting,
 and maybe coming to their first
 big conference… Yes.
 …because you’ve experienced going from coming into a big
 conference, is there any
 particular advice or any thoughts you might think of that
 they might not be prepared for
 or maybe are overly prepared for? Anything that…
 You know, when you… Do you mean when you are accepted to
 go, or…?
 Yeah, like when you’re going to go to a talk at a big
 conference that’s, you know,
 100… well over 100 people, or a multi-day track, and it’s
 going to be a bigger conference,
 you know, there’s… What are maybe… I’ll split that into
 two questions. What are some
 things that they should be prepared for, and what, if
 anything, is that they might be thinking
 that they’re used to at a smaller venue that they…
 Okay. …that won’t translate well into a larger
 venue? Okay, exactly.
 It’s a hard question. Yeah, but I could say that one thing
 is that
 sometimes you get shocked by the number of people, and you
 get nervous, and the thing
 that really works for me… Mm-hmm.
 …is to rehearse at least the first three sentences, so
 that I know them by heart, really
 by heart, just rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing, so that
 even if I get very nervous when I
 get on stage, I sort of… I’ve got it down to an
 automation, and once you’ve started
 talking, normally you forget how many people that are there
.
 Yeah, so that first moment… Yeah, that first moment is
 very important.
 Of course you should rehearse your whole presentation, but
 that first moment is really important,
 that you really say it out loud many times, and also if
 people are asking you a question
 from the audience… Mm-hmm.
 …you have to remember to repeat the question, of course,
 so that everybody knows
 that you’ve understood the question correctly, and
 everybody has heard the question.
 Right. So that would be one of the things.
 Okay. And then don’t listen to all the bad criticism
 you get. Yeah, try to turn it off a little bit.
 Yeah. Okay, well, not for real. Thank you very much.
 That was practice on the first time. Thank you very much
 for taking the time to speak
 with me. You’re welcome.

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic.
 I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015 and I’m standing here with Chad F
owler, who’s giving the closing
 keynote for the event.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me,
 Chad.
 So what is the story, what is the message you want people
 to take away from your keynote?
 Well, I’m going to tell a story of the recreation of Wunder
list, which is the app that I work
 on, app and service.
 So it’s going to be a story, literally in that sense, one
 of those kind of here’s what
 happened from, I hope so, yeah, I’m not sure, I’m not sure
 if there’s a hero yet.
 The humble task list rises up to become the Wunderlist.
 And it rises up from the flames, literally.
 But yeah, my overarching message is that I am sort of on a
 mission in my career to learn
 how to build software that can outlive me and outlive us.
 Ideally without us dying.
 I’m going to talk about some of the things that I’ve
 learned in my career and that I’ve
 applied on this most recent project in hopes that they
 inspire ideas in other people, that
 they can create software that can survive longer.
 That is one of the, sometimes I think, things that people,
 we try not to think about the
 mortality of our work, that it’s, I don’t know if my work’s
 going to survive the next
 framework upgrade, much less.
 But yeah.
 I think that’s one of the things that I’ve learned.
 I think that’s one of the things that I’m going to be able
 to go into the future and
 support.
 You know, something that might actually be useful for my
 kids.
 Well, most of our work actually doesn’t survive even the
 project that’s never born, so that’s
 the sad thing.
 Most of the work that we do in the software industry is
 stillborn, or not even that, it’s
 just canceled.
 You know, if you look at the Standish Chaos Report, which
 is of course kind of a maligned
 thing, but everyone references it and it feels direction
ally correct, most software projects
 either fail or are significantly changed.
 And by the Standish language, I would say significantly
 challenged means failed.
 So most projects basically fail that we work on.
 And then as you and I know, we build software and we tend
 to have to throw it away, someone
 has to throw it away at some point in the not so distant
 future.
 So if most projects fail, and then things that get launched
, they live maybe five years,
 it’s kind of like you spend all this time, this passion,
 this energy of your life working
 on stuff.
 That is ultimately kind of meaningless.
 So that’s sad.
 And I’ve spent a large portion of my career euthanizing
 software systems.
 Going into a situation, finding a dying or sick system, and
 trying to humanely put it
 to sleep.
 And I’m tired of doing that.
 So are you going to be looking at some of our tools that we
 use, or is it mostly about
 techniques?
 It’s mostly about architecture.
 The thing that has inspired me the most is looking at how
 biological systems work, specifically
 like human bodies, how someone like I can still be alive
 after 41 years, given the poor
 maintenance that I’ve done on the system, and take some of
 those metaphors of like cellular
 regeneration and homeostasis and apply them to software
 architectures.
 But I think that’s the main kind of overriding theme.
 Yeah.
 I mean, like I’m going to talk about micro services, but I
 don’t really care about that
 term.
 And I think it’s silly for people to be excited about the
 term.
 It’s more about creating an architecture where the system
 can evolve and change frameworks
 like you mentioned, or even change languages, technologies,
 whatever, and the system can
 still live through all these things, even if the components
 are being regenerated on
 a regular basis.
 Yeah.
 Well, I mean, thinking about a lifetime of software and
 whether it evolves, I mean, one
 thing is…
 From what I understand, the human body basically, after a
 certain number of decades,
 has completely replaced all the cells except for some
 really core stuff in our marrow.
 Software, when you’re saying alive, if it’s just being ref
actored, not entirely just replaced outright,
 is that still staying alive, or is a rewrite just another
 way of perpetuating the ideas that were inside of the
 original software?
 Yeah, it depends on how you think of it, of course.
 Although I would say that the parallels of a rewrite to
 cellular generation, they don’t really map.
 When a rewrite occurs, though the ideas still exist, the
 software is completely replaced.
 It usually looks and behaves differently.
 It doesn’t have to, but it almost always does,
 because that’s how it works.
 That’s how rewrites go.
 So, to me, the ability to have the system continue to stand
 in place and continue to work
 is an important part of considering it to have lived or
 survived.
 So, you’re right, the idea that here we are,
 you’re Mike and I’m Chad, and we’re the same people that we
 were when we were born,
 but not really the same physical substance.
 That’s what I’m getting at.
 Notably, we didn’t notice.
 We didn’t feel when the cells were regenerated, and no one
 around us noticed.
 There wasn’t an impact on our continuing function, actually
, and improved our function.
 That’s the way systems should evolve and the systems should
 survive.
 Well, I can also look at that as kids, as a parent.
 I’m watching, I am watching that evolution of the cells
 changing in over years.
 And you do, I mean, you might not feel it on a day-to-day
 basis because it happens so slowly.
 I mean, I don’t know if that has any kind of correlation.
 I don’t know if that has any kind of correlation to the
 idea of the evolution of software.
 And even though it’s changing, it’s still the same entity,
 but it slowly changes, it develops, it gets a little bit
 stronger,
 and eventually, after a while, well, I mean, everything
 dies and it gets weaker.
 It gets weaker, it gets sicker.
 So, sure, you know, and there’s also, there’s something to
 be said.
 Like, I used to think about, what if we could just build
 software so quickly
 that it didn’t work?
 It didn’t matter, we could just throw it away.
 Right.
 So then we don’t worry about longevity of software.
 And now I’m sort of meeting the middle where you can build
 components so quickly,
 you can throw them away, and you should.
 But, you know, so over time, the system might be irrelevant
, and that’s when it should die.
 Not when the implementation is irrelevant, right?
 Okay.
 I can imagine in software systems, depending on who’s
 working on them and how focused they are
 and all sorts of other factors, they might get weaker over
 time if they were to evolve in this way.
 Or maybe subsystems would get weaker over time.
 But you would then notice that they’re weaker and it would
 work on them in the same way
 that a doctor would work on a patient or, you know,
 whatever.
 Yeah, you get bad knees.
 Okay, we’re going to just replace those.
 We don’t have to replace, we don’t have to take you out
 back and put an old yeller on you and then say,
 “Oh, well, we built a new one that has new knees.”
 Well, anyway, thank you very much for taking the time to
 speak to me.
 I appreciate it.
 Sounds like a fascinating keynote.
 Looking forward to it.
 I hope so.</p>

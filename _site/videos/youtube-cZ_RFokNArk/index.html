      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic, and I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015
 again.
 I’m standing here with Justin Meyer, who gave a talk on how
 to build single-page applications the right way.
 Did I say those in the right order?
 Close enough. You did a good job.
 So those words were in the title of his talk.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
 So about building single-page applications the right way,
 what was that talk about that wasn’t in the title?
 Yeah, so the longer title would be that I’ve done
 consulting for like eight years, front-end JavaScript
 consulting,
 built a bunch of different projects for a lot of different
 companies,
 and I wanted to see if I could put in one 50-minute talk
 all the different techniques and strategies we use
 to make applications, I would say, competitive in kind of
 the world we are now,
 where if you want it to be as fast as possible, maintain
able as possible,
 what are all the best things that you should probably be
 doing, and how do we do them, as an example?
 Okay, so with your talk, what were some of the high points,
 or what were some of the lessons maybe that you were trying
 to bring and surface?
 So the biggest one was, or what my favorite was, was the
 model layer that we added.
 We kind of discovered that when you make a request for page
 data,
 or like, hey, I want a list of to-dos, you’re always, in
 the params that you pass to the server,
 those always represent a set.
 Like, I want to-dos for user ID 5, so you put an object
 with user ID 5 in it.
 That represents a set, and then if you can compare that set
 to other sets that you’re loading,
 you can do all these sophisticated performance optim
izations for free.
 So if you want to, if you have multiple, if you have pages
 that are making multiple requests at the same time,
 you can, like, union those sets to make a single request
 for all data.
 You can do things like fall-through caching, and the
 biggest one, of all of them, I thought,
 was how easy real-time behavior becomes.
 So normally when you request data from a page, from the
 server, and you get a list of elements,
 or a list of items, to-dos, and you just stick that into
 the browser, right?
 You’ll use, like, live binding, so if the list changes,
 well, the page will update itself.
 You’ll just get that list, but if you can associate the set
 of data that was used to retrieve that list,
 and keep a reference to that list, and it’s set, then when
 a new data item comes in,
 you can automatically decide, does it belong in that set,
 or is it in that set and needs to be removed?
 So all the normal stuff you have to do with the real time
 of, like, updates come in,
 and maintaining these lists and what’s visually on the page
, you can get that automatically if you have set awareness.
 Okay.
 So were these lessons that were coming from your production
 environments, or…?
 Yeah, so, from our clients, so we…
 You’re drifting a little bit.
 Am I drifting a little bit?
 Let me stay in.
 Yeah, yeah, you’re great.
 So the one from the…the biggest example for the set stuff
 came from an application we wrote
 that was kind of like a file manager, and it had real-time
 connection.
 So if new files would come in, we’d have to put them in the
 right place, and also, it would load
 the folders and the folders and the files into independent
 widgets, and we wanted to write them
 so they didn’t have to know about each other, like the
 folders and the files and folders.
 So we wrote this layer to automatically detect that you
 were loading overlapping data, unify it,
 make a single request, and then kind of feed it back out.
 So it sounds like, you know, a lot of people look at single
-page applications and think,
 “Oh, it’s just easier to write JavaScript than it is to
 write server-side code and deal with that.”
 But it sounds like it’s not really the case.
 It sounds like there is a lot of thought that has to be put
 into the architecture supporting a single-page application
 that isn’t obvious.
 Yes, if you want to…I mean, it’s…if you’re writing an
 application, it’s all about how complex your application
 you’re writing.
 I do tend to think that writing JavaScript code for the
 same set of features tends to be easier.
 Doing front, like, thin-server architecture is definitely
 easier than writing, you know, from the server’s
 perspective.
 Because it’s kind of somehow easier to, like, pull your
 data in, draw the page all in the client, than to
 definitely do it on the server.
 But what my talk was about is if you want those kind of
 features that people want and expect out of apps now, like
 Realtime is a good example.
 Or if you want it to run really fast, you have to…yeah,
 there’s a lot of sophisticated stuff you have to do.
 But I think we’ve found ways of making that a lot easier.
 Okay, okay.
 And, you know, the ecosystem around single-page
 architecture…
 I mean, the ecosystem around single-page architecture is
 constantly in flux, and ironically, flux.
 It’s just MVVM, but branded with a new name.
 So, when people are looking at building a single-page
 architecture now, and they’re looking at a plethora of
 options, you know, Angular is God’s…what’s the…some
 plastic name, I can’t think of it…Polymer.
 Google has Polymer, yeah.
 Yeah, Google has Polymer.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And, you know, Backbone seems to be kind of on life support
.
 Yeah.
 I mean, there’s so many choices.
 I mean, how…do you talk about, like, how you can evaluate
 how your needs…
 Yeah.
 …relate to capabilities, or Ember, you know, that’s
 another…
 Yeah.
 …because there’s so many.
 Like, do you talk about those kinds of decisions?
 Not in this talk, but I’m happy to talk about it.
 Okay.
 So, I’m extremely biased, because I’m the maintainer of C
angeas, which is a framework, and that’s what my
 presentation is.
 Okay.
 So, I’m extremely biased, because I’m the maintainer of C
angeas, which is a framework, and that’s what my
 presentation is.
 presentation showed, how, at least for what we care about,
 is I built JavaScript WC like
 seven years ago, and what we say is that if you would use
 that and kept with us, we will
 be able to upgrade you to the latest, greatest features,
 because CanJS has everything that
 all the other frameworks have.
 But you’re absolutely right in that it’s a rapidly changing
 world, right?
 Backbone was huge, Angular was huge, now it seems like
 React is going to eat a lot of
 Angular’s lunch.
 One of the first points I actually made in my talk was that
 how technology choices matter
 far less than management and user experience choices, and
 this is actually backed up by
 data that we’ve accumulated with our company.
 So the first thing I talked about is how we use checklists
 to make sure we’re doing the
 right things on projects.
 We didn’t go to a client and be like, hey, are you guys
 doing these things?
 Let’s figure out a way to do that.
 But we’ve kept data over the things over time of what we
 have and haven’t done, and we’ve
 all wrote what correlates strongest to project success, and
 things like how long will it
 be until your first release?
 Do you do social events with your company?
 Are you doing user experience testing?
 It matters far, far more than things.
 It’s like, are you even running tests?
 Okay, so just kind of taking a spin on culture as being a,
 well, I think there was a talk
 where they, or some kind of common wisdom about that your
 architecture represents your
 communication system, and it sounds like you’re kind of in
 that same spirit of like, if you’re
 going to be building something, how are you guys
 communicating, and how is the company
 going about building its products?
 Yeah.
 Not just like, are you doing TDD, but how do you talk?
 How do you communicate?
 That’s exactly, like, I think that, so everybody wants to
 do framework wars discussions, and
 they’re valid, because there’s interesting differences, and
 I’m happy to go into that,
 but my first point I always make is that if you’re looking
 at a choice of framework is
 going to matter in terms of success or not with your
 application, it’s probably not,
 and if you really do care about success, you do care about
 those things of communication,
 are we building the right app for the right people?
 That kind of things, and I also think that in choice of
 framework, pick which one you
 guys can get behind the most, because I’ve been in
 situations where some people want
 this framework, and other people want this framework, you
 need everybody on the same
 page, just get them on the same page.
 It doesn’t matter even if you’re going to be like, we want
 to use Backbone, even though
 in terms of features, it’s kind of been left behind, if
 everybody’s together, and you’re
 all going to invest in it, and everybody’s going to be
 experts in Backbone, you’ll produce
 something.
 It’s going to be way better than the newest bleeding edge
 framework with all of the bells
 and whistles.
 It’s even the same with, it sounds like what you’re
 describing is PHP versus Ruby versus
 Python.
 If you’re a professional, you know what you want to build,
 you’re going to build something,
 whether it’s in VB or it’s in Clojure, two ends of the
 popularity spectrum of who thinks
 who’s smartest, which we know, it’s the person who makes
 the most money, but the point is
 that if you’re having a hard time, if you’re having a hard
 time, if you’re having a hard
 time, if you’re happy with what you’re going to be building
, and at least you can get everybody
 working together and wrapping their heads around the
 complexity of the problem, it doesn’t
 matter whether you use Flathead, Screwdrivers, or Philips,
 you’re going to build something.
 Okay, well thank you very much for taking the time to speak
 with me, I appreciate it.
 Thank you, Mike.
 Thanks.
 Thank you.
 Bye.</p>

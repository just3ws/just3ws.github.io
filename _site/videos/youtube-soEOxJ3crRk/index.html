      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here again at GOTO Conf</p>
<ol>
  <li>I’m sitting here
 with Courtney Hempel, who gave a talk about building
 products for our customers,
 which might sound kind of redundant, but it’s something
 that, as you described, we
 don’t always think about when we’re creating software. So
 thank you very much for taking
 the time to speak with me. Can you tell me what you mean by
 designing software
 for our customers? Sure, and I agree with you, it does
 sound redundant. Everyone sort of thinks that they have
 that
 objective, but it’s trickier than you think. And what we
 found, you know, we
 were a development shop since 2000, we’ve done Agile XP
 from the get-go, and we
 found that that process actually was what allowed us to
 deliver software as
 quickly as possible to our clients. What we found, though,
 was that oftentimes what you were giving your
 clients might not actually be what the market was looking
 for, and some of our
 clients sort of made that realization as well. We ended up
 partnering with some
 incredible design firms. We worked a lot with IDEO, Hot
 Studio, and they were
 fantastic in helping us craft beautiful vision for the
 products. However, once you
 start taking sort of a vision and making it reality, as you
 can imagine, there are
 changes that need to be made, and interfaces are very
 specific to how
 users will engage with them, and they have a technical
 component. So we have decided,
 and we’ve been doing this for about six years, to bring
 sort of the design closer
 to the development. So the talk that I gave was how our
 teams of developers, and
 now with embedded designers that are on site at Carbon5 and
 that are part of
 our team, are working together, very iteratively on a
 weekly fashion, to both
 plan and come up with hypotheses each week that they’re
 testing against, and
 that they are looking to gain an actual metric against at
 the end of the week
 for putting in front of users and really refuting or valid
ating the hypothesis
 about that product or that feature set. So you’re actually
 really doing
 experimental work, I mean, to say, okay, this is what I
 think is going to be the
 result, and then measure that and see if it actually was.
 And when you mentioned
 IDEO, that’s a very interesting company to work with. If
 you don’t know IDEO,
 they’re a product design company. So they create things in
 meet space that
 people really use. How did that working relationship affect
, you know, something
 that was more, we usually think of as intangible, like
 software. Did that
 collaboration change the way you approached usability? Sure
, it’s a good
 question. And two points that I’d want to pull out there is
, one, I think where
 you’re sort of angling at is this idea of, you know, what
 does software mean in
 today’s world, where it’s really not just these intangible
 kind of digital
 interfaces, it really has a lot more than that. I will say,
 you know, one of the more
 interesting projects that we had with IDEO was for Genente
ch, and it was for a
 TED conference. And we were literally putting together what
 was termed the
 genetic symphony of participants at TED. And so people
 would actually come to the
 event, they would swab using a DNA stick, and we would
 actually get the DNA for that particular person,
 and we would chart that based on sort of like the heretics
 of their DNA against
 sort of the musical composure. So it was a very sort of,
 you know, artistic endeavor,
 and it very much had a software component backing it. It
 was kind of the
 algorithms against the DNA and the musical components. We
 were creating a
 symphony of these attendees, but there was obviously an
 experience process that
 was designed by IDEO. So it was a very intense project, and
 I will not lie, but because it was backed by an event which
 happens, you know, at a moment in time. But it was an
 incredible engagement, and
 what was successful about it was every day we had
 communications with IDEO, every
 day we were sort of testing, and you know, the original
 vision was huge. And what we
 helped them to do was sort of take, you know, the easiest
 slices of the pie that
 we could do in order to make this a reality, and sort of
 dropping the bells
 and whistles and, you know, leaving some time to bring back
 the ones that were
 most critical, but trying to sort of take a stab at the
 full experience and making
 sure we get it done by that event date. And that’s sort of
 what we have seen as to be a big success.
 Is that you can do a lot, but what you want to do is just
 enough to make it so
 that it is a success. And whether it’s a success as an
 event, or as a product that
 you’re coming to market with, that’s what really is a
 company we’re trying to optimize for.
 Right, and I’m trying to even imagine that musical
 components, because
 it’s even a third dimension, that you’ve got a software
 product that
 you’re delivering that’s going to have an interface. People
 actually swabbing,
 and there’s a physical thing that has to be done that I’m
 not sure how that would have even gone down.
 There is a lot of moving parts. Yeah, and then trying to
 create, you know, like the
 artistic, like did you work with musicians to help? We did.
 IDEO brought in
 some musicians that were there to sort of set the score,
 and the scores were
 sort of backed, you know, each individual person has sort
 of a DNA profile, and
 there can be sort of groupings of these profiles. So what
 we were doing was,
 instead of trying to literally put a note to every
 potential DNA string, what
 we were doing is taking these DNA traits, sort of these
 segments of strings, and
 putting a note to them. So that way we were sort of
 minimizing the amount of
 sort of variables in the iteration, and that’s how we
 managed that. Is this talk
 available? Do you have a link to it? I would definitely
 like to have that. Well, the talk that I gave isn’t about
 the Genentech stuff, it’s about two other projects that I
 worked on. So we’ve worked on a lot of projects. This is
 sort of one that I’ve
 been pulling out from the IDEO. The talk actually is about
 two companies. One is
 called Bookrunner, and the other one is called Sharethru,
 and one was the data
 visualization of effectively sort of sharing of videos
 through different
 channels like Google+ and Twitter and what have you, and
 ways in which you can
 pull out sort of when a video went viral and who the
 influencers were. Bookrunner was a
 project that we did where we were comparing, we were trying
 to enhance the
 experience of kids that are in college that are trying to
 purchase textbooks,
 and allowing them to have more transparency into what their
 options were,
 you know, including Amazon, including Bookrunner, including
 the New Pursuit
 bookstore. So we were trying to do it, you know, when and
 where it mattered to them
 in the bookstore, and using SMS and mobile web kit to
 facilitate that
 endeavor. Yeah, because it could be very, I mean, I’ve seen
 sisters-in-law recently
 graduate, and it’s ludicrous, the amount of money and
 requirements to buy books.
 It’s crazy, I know, which is why I love that company,
 because they were being
 really honest and authentic about it. Right, so, you know,
 so you’re describing
 how you created these products, and I’m sorry, this is very
 late in the day, so I’m
 trying to keep up, but you know, it’s okay. So your
 presentation, you
 described… It’s the process, yeah, the process. The
 presentation is, well, we’re, what we did with both of
 these companies, and we were sort of
 optimizing this process during the course of these two
 projects, and
 we would sit down with the team, and this is the full team,
 this is, you know,
 developers, designers, and the product owner, it’s really
 the balanced team at
 Carbon 5, and having those, you know, people, and that wasn
‘t just three, you
 know, there were more developers than just one, there were
 potentially more and more designers, but
 coming up with sort of the plan for the week, you know,
 particularly in the
 book writer case, it was, will people really understand
 these shelf tags, and
 how to get access to these prices, right? What’s like the
 fastest way on an SMS
 flip phone to get to prices that we want them to see? So we
 would come up with how
 to go about this hypothesis. Well, we think it’ll take, you
 know, two entering of
 numerals, and we want to engage them, you know, with a
 small bit of a URL, the QR,
 but whatever, you know, so we’ve come up with these
 hypotheses, some of which sort
 of had high product risk, or high technical risk, and so we
 were, you know,
 the talk is sort of how we were putting that in front of
 users as quickly as
 possible every week to make sure that we were creating a
 product that these users
 would use. The second part of the talk is really the anchor
 of our cadence, which is what we call it, this weekly
 iteration cycle,
 and that’s when we bring in users and we would test them.
 So whatever we thought they would do, we
 had to validate that on Friday with the customer, and so we
 would be working and
 developing and designing an actual production-ready code
base that we would
 then release, we were doing continuous release, but on
 Friday we would bring in,
 we called it five on Friday at Book Writer, right? We would
, you know, have beers, bring in some students, you know,
 these are just, you know, we would have them try, you know,
 we’d give them gift certificates, and they would tell us,
 ah, this is great, or oh, this is not so great.
 Now, when you would do an experiment, if you had multiple
 experiments that seemed to be trending in maybe a not
 necessarily positive way,
 was there a strategy, did that ever happen, where you had
 to, you started on a
 path and then it just seemed to not be a positive, how did
 you… I love that
 question, because it is the relevant one, right? Yeah, so
 we, I’ll use ShareFu because that’s
 actually the best case example of that, we went down a path
 for the first maybe
 three weeks that was sort of, we used D3, a job
 framework for visualization of data and interaction, and we
, initially we did a
 spike that was pretty quick because we were, we used D3 and
 really harnessed
 sort of fake data and put it in front of users and sort of
 see if they could
 intuit what we were trying to get them to see. We failed
 miserably the first week.
 The good thing about sort of the way that we’re coding is
 that we’re putting
 into our code a very flexible sort of domain structure, and
 so at the bare
 minimum, you know, we know the users that we’re aiming for,
 we know sort of their behavioral characteristics, and
 we know some of the domain language, and we’re coding that
 sort of into the
 production code, and then we will do spikes. So the spikes
 are sort of
 opportunities for us to maybe not do as test-driven
 development, and they’re in a
 branch, they’re completely separate from the master, and
 that’s the ones where we
 can really do some wild testing. If it works, then we fill
 out the test and we
 pull it back into the master. If it doesn’t work, we can
 kind of let that
 spike go. The great thing about that is we have two
 opportunities. One is we can
 kind of go away from the norm and not be scared about, you
 know,
 messing up the core code base, and secondarily, when you
 have sort of an
 easy prototype to mess around with, you can actually real-
time mess around with
 it, so we would, you know, mess with things in Chrome and
 then try it again
 with them. We also did this thing called hybrid prototyping
, where we would take
 sort of the visual language in the interface, and we would
 put it on a
 whiteboard, and we would draw sort of, you know, a graph
 around it, and say, “Okay, use
 your fingers and mouse, talk us through what you would
 expect to see or what you
 would want to see.” And that saved us an entire week of
 coding, because they got
 sort of the visual language of what we had presented to
 them,
 before, and they could use that to then sort of say, “I
 would have preferred to
 have seen this,” or, “This would have been more helpful.”
 Yeah, so, like, I click this,
 and now I’m expecting to see the shoes that I selected in
 my
 online store, and the ability to say this was large, small,
 you know, things.
 Whatever, yeah. I mean, for the marketers in this case,
 what they were doing was, it
 was hard for them to see immediately where they needed to
 click to find what
 they call the “influencers” in the channels. The people
 that will tweet about a video
 and make it go viral, and so they were saying, “I wish this
 node stood out more,
 I wish it was bigger, I wish it was more indicative of the
 amount of shares that, you know,
 launched from them.” So, that sort of influenced us to say,
 “Oh, we’re just going to make that big.”
 And when you were describing experiments and writing these
 spikes, and then
 bringing that back in, and then backfilling tests, you know
, there’s a lot
 of people that think, “Oh, test driven development means I
 just sit down and write a
 test, and then check to see whether it did what I expected
 it to do.” And that’s a really
 low-level thing, but it sounds like what you’re doing was
 really test-driven, like
 literally the scientific word for test, where you just
 create something, and
 then say, “How did that?” Sure, and this actually question
 came up yesterday, and I really
 appreciated it. I think that there is a distinction to be
 made between testing
 your code, which is effectively, you know, unit testing,
 and I would say, interrupt,
 what am I trying to say, functional testing. That’s
 different to me, and we do do that in
 the core. Anything that is in the core code does need to be
 tested. The spikes
 absolutely are an edge case, and we’re still testing there,
 but we might not be
 doing a stringent sort of like test first, make it fail,
 and then make it pass,
 only because we’re looking for speed. But, you know, not
 having test coverage in
 your code base is something that actually, I don’t think,
 is really
 comfortable for the long run when you’re doing production.
 But we are also
 doing what I would say more is like market testing, and
 that is very
 different. I mean, you know, testing sort of can get thrown
 around a lot. I think
 these are two different things, and we are very in favor of
 the scientific
 method using that sort of for the marketing testing,
 because I think it
 makes us sort of a little bit more honest about what we’re
 doing, and it
 allows all voices to be heard, development, design, and
 product, and
 additionally, it has something to back sort of the yes or
 no. So oftentimes,
 particularly if you’re, you know, the business owner, you
 can be really sort of
 wedded to your ideas, and for them to become convinced that
 that idea is
 really not going to work in the market, at least not the
 way that they
 currently have configured it, it takes their users to tell
 them that. And
 equivalently, for developers, a lot of the time they’ll be
 like, “No, this is the
 best technological approach.” And for users to come back
 and be like, “I do not
 deal with this.” They do not care whether you’re using Ruby
 or… Really, they don’t.
 They’re happy with a bbgui to trace the IP address.
 Seriously, they would be. Sometimes
 they were. They’re like, “I just want, you know, show me
 the graph like in an Excel
 doc or something,” which you’re like, “Ugh.” Yeah, but that
‘s what they’re already comfortable with. Exactly.
 And, I mean, the whole industry has run off of spreadsheets
. Totally. Well, thank you very much for taking the time to
 speak with me.
 Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. That’s awesome
.

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2014. I
‘m standing here with Alex and Joel who
 just gave a talk about remote pairing. Actually, what was
 the title exactly of the talk again?
 The title of the talk was “The Best of Both Worlds: Remote
 Pairing in Action.”
 Or Pairing Without Pants. Pairing Without Pants, for sure.
 First, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. So,
 this topic, where is this coming
 from and what was the topic about? I mean, it’s remote
 pairing, but what about remote
 pairing? Well, we have both been working for
 a company that is a startup that’s entirely remote. For the
 past year, we’ve been working
 there, and everyone at the company pairs remotely, and it’s
 a very new concept. Most people work
 in an office or they work from home by themselves.
 So, we wanted to expose people to this style of working
 that allows you to have interaction
 with people, but also allows you to have a more flexible
 schedule and work from your
 own environment. Okay. So, in the talk, were you giving
 tips
 or just more sharing anecdotal experiences? Yeah. So, it
 was more like the latter where
 we talked about the anecdotal experiences, the tools we use
, some of the ones. It’s not
 like we’re saying, “Hey, use this exactly.” We tried this,
 it didn’t work or it worked
 well, this is why, and all the stuff that just helps make
 our day-to-day lives easier
 so we can focus on actually writing code. And the types of
 applications are you writing?
 Are they web applications, Windows applications? What
 platform are you starting from?
 Yes, they’re mostly web applications and some backend stuff
, too, for our clients,
 and we aim to get everyone using them on Chrome, but still
 are stuck with some IDA users as
 well, so. That doesn’t die. But more for the developers who
 are working
 on the team, or are you saying that there’s developers in
 the team that are still working
 on different… Oh, no. The developers in the team, we
 mostly
 develop our applications for Chrome. Okay. And everybody’s
 probably, what, running
 MacBooks or are you a Windows shop? Yeah. So, we actually
 have a pretty standard
 setup where everyone has a MacBook Pro and two Thunderbolt
 displays, just so when you’re
 screen sharing, you can kind of have the other person’s
 screen up and also still have room
 to maybe Google some stuff on yours. And, you know,
 everyone’s got their own kind of
 thing. So, everyone seems to be pretty happy with, you know
, some Linux flavor. Some people
 might prefer actually using Ubuntu, but Mac’s close enough
 that everyone can be happy with
 it. Right. And so, you’re working collaboratively. Your
 teams are remote. I mean, are you global
 remote or…? We are. We try to stick within the four US
 time zones right now because we
 try to stick with a consistent workday and core hours for
 everyone, but that might change
 in the future. But right now, we are spread across the
 entire continent of the United
 States. Oh, yeah. That’s interesting because it brings to
 the next question I was thinking
 about is office hours and having collaboration as a
 strictly developers working out between
 themselves or do you have, like you said, an office hours
 kind of…? So, right now,
 we pretty much are collaborating the entire day. We start
 at 9:00 AM central and then
 just kind of go to the day ends. But obviously, like,
 sometimes our team is an odd number
 because someone’s out or someone’s got something going on
 or just wants to work by the minute.
 So, they work by themselves for a little bit that day. So,
 we kind of make it work. We
 are, as we get more people on the West Coast and our team
 becomes this collaboration of
 people across multiple time zones, we are kind of having to
 move to that, the core hours
 concept where like, “Hey, try and be online between these
 hours.” So, we can pair then
 and then either pair with somebody in your time zone at the
 other end or maybe just work
 on learning something new. Yeah. And that’s interesting.
 You were saying about pair with
 somebody in your time zone where I wondered if there was
 some kind of striping maybe across
 time zones where, because people just overlapped more, they
 collaborated more.
 We haven’t gotten to that point yet, but we are growing so
 rapidly. We’ve gone from
 one to 25 developers, 50 employees over the past year. And
 so, if we start to get bigger
 contingencies in each time zone, that might be somewhere
 away that we go.
 And you alluded to some tools that you use. You described
 that every developer has two
 monitors so that way they can pair and chat. What are some
 of the other tools that you
 use and recommend?
 So, we use, right now we’re just using OS X screen share
 for screen sharing. I know
 there are a lot of other tools out there. One of the other
 ones we’ve liked was Screen
 Hero. As you said, you’ve used that before.
 We also use what’s called Zoom for video conversations. It
‘s similar to Google Hangouts that you can
 just quickly add people and people can drop. It seems to be
 a little bit better on your
 computer in the long run. And then we also use Slack, which
 is just a kind of like IM
 chat where you can have groups.
 Oh, it’s like the Hip Chat.
 Yeah, it’s very similar to Hip Chat. So, it’s persistent.
 You can search it. You can have
 different groups. You can email or IM someone directly. So,
 those are the biggest tools
 we use. Did I miss anything?
 For our task boards and for transparency between the
 different groups, we use Trello. So, that’s
 like kind of an online agile task board type system where
 you have user stories and you
 can move them across and see what people are working on.
 Right. And when you’re doing your… Do you have any
 questions about that?
 Are you interagent planning meetings and things like that?
 Or how do you structure? So, on
 a day-to-day basis, you know, people pair off and probably,
 I’m presuming, have a daily
 kind of…
 Stand-up.
 Yeah, stand-up or sit-down, whichever the case might be.
 But how do you structure work
 in a longer cycle?
 We so far have had minimal structure. Basically, as the
 business finds more features they need
 to add them to the prioritized column. More recently,
 because work is piling up basically
 in different areas, we want to keep our task board more
 clean. And so, we’ve tried to move
 more towards one-week iterations, but still minimal process
. We have a brief meeting where
 we move some cards over into the next week’s work, but not
 a lot of… In previous jobs,
 we’ve had long strip planning meetings and things like that
, and we don’t want to get
 into that. So, we just keep away from it.
 So, try to keep it a little low formality.
 Yes, yes. Low formality.
 And from your presentation, did you present any specific
 tips or pitfalls that you would…
 So, the biggest pitfalls are, like we said, the time zones
 and whiteboarding solutions.
 And when you’re working in an office with someone, it’s
 really easy to just draw on
 a whiteboard, kind of get that going.
 It’s a little bit harder remote, and mainly it’s only
 harder because those tools are,
 like, iPad-specific, and so they require having an iPad,
 whereas things we use, like
 Zoom and Slack, are free. So, it’s kind of like, let’s have
 this low overhead.
 Okay.
 As far as tips, we kind of, like, we just try something,
 see if it works, and just
 don’t stick to it. Don’t say, “You have to use this.” If it
 doesn’t work, try something
 else.
 Be open for experimentation. Don’t be too dogmatic, because
 a lot of this stuff is kind
 of new. I mean, the technologies are new. A lot of these
 things are new. I mean, you
 know, the whole idea of remote working is kind of new.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me. I really appreciate it.
 Thank you. It was great talking to you. Enjoy the
 conference.
 Will do.

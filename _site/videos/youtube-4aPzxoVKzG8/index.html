      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here again at GOTO Conf 2015
 sitting here with Dean
 Wampler who’s giving a talk on data science with Spark.
 Thank you very much
 for taking the time to speak with me Dean. You know the big
 question is and kind of
 jokingly what is data science but more in the moment what
 is Spark? So Spark is
 a distributed computing engine designed for data systems
 that was invented about
 five or so years ago as a research project in Berkeley and
 it’s now an
 Apache project and it’s now an official tool in the Hadoop
 ecosystem but even
 outside it as well for you know either processing like
 large data sets that you
 have either on you know the file system somewhere or a
 database or data
 streaming in from say you know Twitter or you know your log
 files or whatever
 so you can do transformations, analyze it, even machine
 learning algorithms like
 looking for anomalies or you’re making predictions and
 things like that.
 Interesting about the logs that it’s one of those aspects
 that we tend to as
 developers forget has real data in there can tell us a lot
 about how our systems
 are working but the thing I’m thinking about is there’s
 been kind of a theme
 from some of the interviews I’ve spoken to about this
 concept that these
 new ways of like I don’t know if they’re second generation
 versions of these massive
 processing systems you know what is it about Spark compared
 to like Ignite or
 some of the other vendor offerings that we have here. Yeah
 so you made a good
 point that it’s kind of a second generation tool it’s
 really sort of a
 rethinking of the original Hadoop tool called MapReduce
 which actually was
 invented at Google making it more flexible for different
 problems more efficient so
 that you can do things like highly iterative processing
 that turns out to be important for things like machines.
 learning or if you’re representing your data as a graph and
 you need to walk the edges of the graph that sort of thing
 you know it
 compared to like some of the commercial tools that are
 available it’s it’s a
 little rougher around the edges because it’s you know it
 has been open source it
 was like I said a research project that’s rapidly being
 adopted by industry so a
 lot of times it’s a question of do I have the scale
 requirements and maybe
 the flexibility to work with an open source tool and I’m
 less concerned about
 something that’s you know maybe as mature as mature and
 commercially
 supported it’s like a proprietary system or some of the
 proprietary systems are
 really really good it’s particular kinds of problems and
 particular kinds of users
 and whereas something like Spark is more general purpose
 and can be more widely
 used but you might have to do a little more self-service at
 this stage but
 that’s you know I like all open source projects which in
 this case it happens
 to be maybe the most active in the world right now with a
 possible exception Linux
 or something you know things just rapidly improve and
 people fill in the
 gaps where needed even you know I work for type safe and we
‘re supporting Spark
 commercially now and we’re also contributing to Spark and
 you know how
 it runs on top of the mesos framework for example which is
 an alternative to
 to Hadoop even there’s a standalone mode if you
 just have a small cluster you want to wire up and then just
 go that’s also an
 interesting option now Spark is gonna be one of those hard
 words to Google is
 there what’s up is there a project page mentioned Apache is
 it yeah I always
 Google when I want to get to the page Apache Spark and it’s
 spark.apache.org
 is the home page for it so yeah that’s yeah you’re right
 the word is a little
 it’s not a really Google friendly word well thank you very
 much for taking the
 time to speak to me my pleasure thank you thanks</p>

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015. I’m
 sitting here with Dr. Rebecca Parsons, who gave a
 presentation on microservices here at the conference.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
 Microservices, what was the talk about, and how did you
 come to give a presentation about microservices? What was
 the driving force for that topic?
 Well, I’ve had a longstanding interest in architecture, and
 I speak a lot about evolutionary architecture as a way of
 making systems that are more adaptable,
 because the system requirements that our business users are
 placing on systems, the rate of change is just continuing
 to increase.
 And so we need systems that are much more adaptable and
 evolvable than they were before.
 And microservices is a relatively new architectural style
 that is gaining traction and done well.
 Microservices architecture does allow you to make changes
 as fast as possible.
 And so this is a nice approach to architecture that
 achieves this goal of an evolutionary architecture.
 Okay. And I know that you’re coming from a much deeper
 background than somebody who’s just read an article on
 microservices.
 Right.
 As a CTO at ThoughtWorks, so was this something that’s
 evolved from pain that you’re seeing at your clients in
 trying to figure out ways to better solve their problems?
 Not just our clients. Organizations like Netflix, Amazon,
 others are looking at architectural styles that are very
 similar to this.
 So this has really grown out of the issues that people are
 facing with services.
 Okay.
 that do have to be incredibly responsive, incredibly
 performant,
 and also responding to changes in required functionality.
 And so it’s been our clients, but it’s also been other
 people in the industry.
 Right, and it’s funny to see this topic.
 It seems to me there’s two camps.
 There’s the DHH and this love of the monolith,
 and then there’s on the other side,
 there’s people who are dealing with polyglot problems.
 I know you’re a polyglot programmer person,
 but polyambiguous problems that are just in all different
 types of ecosystems,
 not just a Ruby one single stack environment.
 What is it, if I’m looking and I’m trying to evaluate,
 I’ve got a Rails app and I’m serving this app,
 and I’m trying to figure out, hey, does this microservices
 technology,
 is this appropriate for growing my application,
 or I’m working in an environment
 that I’m trying to figure out, hey, does this microservices
 technology,
 we have a monolith, should I start thinking more about
 microservices?
 What are some of those thresholds that somebody might want
 to use
 to evaluate whether they should move towards this
 technology?
 Well, one thing is how easy or difficult you’re finding it
 to make the kinds of changes that your users are expecting.
 I mean, a well-designed monolith can be the right decision.
 You would also want to consider things like
 the deployment footprint.
 If you’re going to scale a monolith,
 you’re going to scale the whole monolith.
 And so if you’re doing horizontal scaling
 and you need four of them,
 you’re going to have four of the entire monolith.
 There might only be one part of that infrastructure
 that does need to scale,
 but you don’t have that choice if you’re a monolith.
 So looking at the kinds of problems
 that you’re running into with a monolith,
 it may be that it makes sense to stick with a monolith,
 one of the things I spend a lot of time talking about
 in the presentation were some of the issues
 and the implications.
 Microservices architectures are more complex
 than a single monolith.
 And so you want to make sure that the reason you’re going
 to the microservices architecture is sound.
 Right.
 So it sounds like if I have maybe an email component
 of my application that is the one place
 that I’m always seeing performance bottleneck problems
 and I’m spinning up new instances
 just to support that aspect,
 I can maybe look at exercising that one piece
 into a microservices.
 I mean, is it an all or nothing or can I do piecemeal?
 Oh, you can definitely do piecemeal.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Okay, so I can just, again,
 it sounds like even just good refactoring,
 like an object.
 If I see something that’s doing too much
 and I have a God object, maybe pull that out.
 I mean, is a lot of this stuff with microservices
 really just taking object-oriented programming concepts
 to a next level?
 I’m not sure I would just tie it to object orientation,
 because there’s, that is one way of looking at it.
 And some of the concepts from domain-driven development,
 which people tend to associate more with object orientation
,
 although it doesn’t have to be.
 But those concepts apply.
 And a lot of the thinking about what constitutes good
 boundaries,
 it’s the same, they’re the same sort of questions that are
 just being asked at a larger level.
 And when you think about it,
 any time you start with a monolith,
 you’re probably not going to take a big sledgehammer
 and smack it and break it up.
 And you’re going to progressively pull things out.
 And so, yes, for a time, you might have a small number
 of services working with a bigger monolith.
 And as needs arise,
 you could pull more and more stuff out of that monolith.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Okay, well, thank you very much
 for taking the time to speak with me.
 I appreciate it.</li>
  <li>Thank you, Mike.</li>

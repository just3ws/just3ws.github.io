      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2014
 sitting here with Emily, who’s with ThoughtWorks,
 and she helps with some of their interactions with local
 technical community here in Chicago.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
 So, Emily, what is it, how do you work
 with the user groups and what are some of the technical
 communities that you work with here in
 Chicago? So, I help to organize the Chicago Ruby Meetup.
 With Ray Hightower? Yeah, with Ray Hightower that’s hosted
 in the Chicago office, the Chicago ThoughtWorks office. Ray
 does most of the work, but I think it’s
 great to host it at ThoughtWorks every month. And I help
 encourage ThoughtWorks to attend and
 present. Okay, so you have like a proxy and through into
 ThoughtWorks so that we
 can actually help promote the community in ThoughtWorks, as
 well as give a place for
 the meetings to happen, right? Yeah, yeah. I think Thought
Works is lucky to have a large space in the
 AM Center and it’s a great way to give back to the tech
 community to be able to host events like that
 and give people a platform to talk about what they’re doing
. There’s a lot of cool stuff going
 on in the Chicago tech community. Yeah, Chicago is pretty
 active and it’s growing. What are some of the other groups
 that you work with?
 So I’ve been pretty actively involved with OpenGov back in
 1871 for the last year. ThoughtWorks occasionally sponsors
 that as well. So I’ve been helping evangelize the group
 inside ThoughtWorks and get people to attend and get
 involved in different projects.
 And that’s the Open Government with Paul Baker and all the
 movers and shakers here in Chicago’s tech community. So
 when you’re working with these people, how does that work?
 Does ThoughtWorks approach user groups that it sees as
 being really active and special in the community? Or is
 there a way to apply? Like, hey, I have a user group. How
 can I work with ThoughtWorks?
 I think it depends on the user group.
 How we got into the arrangement we’re in. I think in most
 cases, ThoughtWorks has been approached. I think we’ve been
 hosting Chicago really for years. I think originally, maybe
, I don’t even know the full story. I’ll have to ask Ray
 next time we talk to him.
 It’s been so long. It’s lost the history.
 But I think it’s nice to have that consistency of having it
 be in one location. And then for OpenGov back in 1871, some
 of us had gotten involved pretty early on.
 And they were like, oh, we’re going to do this. And then we
 were like, oh, we’re going to do this. And then we were
 like, oh, we’re going to do this. And then we were like, oh
, we’re going to do this. And then we were like, oh, we’re
 going to do this. And then we were like, oh, we’re going to
 do this.
 So we’re looking for some sponsors so that people don’t
 have to pay for their own pizza every week. So that just
 happened to work out for us that time.
 And those are two very different styles of groups. And
 obviously, one is on-site, one is off-site. Does that
 change how you interact with those communities?
 I do think we sponsor. It’s easier to sponsor things inside
 the office. And we have this great space in the Aon Center
 that’s something that we can contribute.
 If people want to host events, we were able to host a
 really cool event leading up to PyCon this year where
 people would give practice talks.
 And it’s not a, at least not yet, it’s not a recurring
 event. But it was really cool. And they needed a space and
 they wanted to invite a lot of people.
 And we were able to provide that and help with the
 organizational details. So I think that’s a way we can help
 out with people that want to get people together in the
 tech industry to talk about something or share what they’re
 doing.
 So yeah, I think that’s easier in some ways.
 Right, right. So when you’re, like if I’m a user group and
 I’m like, well, I would love to be able to be associated
 with ThoughtWorks, do they, is there a specific place they
 should go to maybe try to reach me or should I give them
 your email address?
 That’s a good question. It’s usually just approach someone
 from ThoughtWorks. It doesn’t really matter who. There’s
 not a designated person.
 So if you can get an insider, then it’s usually, yeah.
 See if the date that you’re looking at is available and see
 if it’s something that is aligned with what ThoughtWorks is
 trying to do.
 I think definitely we want to be actively engaged with the
 Chicago tech community. There’s a lot of cool stuff going
 on and ThoughtWorks is doing a lot of cool stuff internally
 and we want to make sure we share as much as we can between
 us two.
 Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt.
 No, no, go on.
 If I’m a user group organizer, so you’ve been working with
 these communities for a while and I, you know, or maybe I’m
 somebody who’s looking to,
 you know, I’m a user group organizer, so you’ve been
 working with these communities for a while and I, you know,
 or maybe I’m somebody who’s looking to, you know, I’m a
 user group organizer, so you’ve been working with these
 communities for a while and I, you know, or maybe I’m
 somebody who’s looking to,
 start a user group. What are some of the activities that
 you do that are, maybe somebody might not realize that they
‘re going to have to do when they’re running a user group?
 Like when you talk about the logistics of food and things
 like that, what are some tricks that you maybe have learned
 about how to manage those kinds of little details?
 I think just looking at how each event goes and make sure
 you use what went well and what didn’t go well to feed in
 for the next one. That’s really the best way to do it.
 That’s really the best advice I can give. I think we
 noticed at Chicago Ruby pretty recently that there was some
 time before the talks would start where people weren’t
 really interacting and we were getting a lot of cool people
 together, but then they didn’t know each other and they
 didn’t know what to do. So I talked with some of the
 organizers and we actually decided to, hey, what if we like
 rearrange the chairs and put them all in like different cl
umps so that when people are sitting there, when they arrive
, they sit with a group of people and they’re not just like
 sitting auditorium style.
 waiting for the presentation, let’s see how it goes. So we
 tried it for the next time and it actually worked pretty
 well. We asked people what they thought and we did find
 that people were interacting more. So I think looking at
 each group is different. So they’re not like set rules that
 are going to work for everyone. It’s going to really depend
 on your group size and what type of community you’re
 attracting. But I think just looking at what’s working for
 you.
 So just pay attention to what is and don’t be afraid to
 experiment.
 Yeah.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to
 me. I appreciate it.
 No problem. Thank you.</p>

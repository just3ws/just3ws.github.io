      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here again at GOTO Conf 2015
. I’m sitting here with
 Dave Dugal, who is giving a talk on distributed processes.
 Thank you very
 much for taking the time to speak with me. So distributed
 processes, it seems to
 be kind of a theme here at this year’s GOTO Conf, but what
 is what is it about
 your talk and how are you describing this concept? Thanks
 for the
 interview. So distributed process is very timely, obviously
 everybody’s trying to
 figure out, and this is a very difficult domain, right, so
 I think people have been
 I think we’ve moved over the last five years from things
 being partially
 distributed to we’re almost like living distributed now,
 right, and people are
 dealing with the scale, they’re dealing with asynchrony,
 they’re dealing with being
 parallel, and these are very complex issues, right,
 managing caches and state
 at scale. So this talk is going to be describing our real-
time data-driven
 policy control platform, and we’re going to describe how,
 you know, how we, we’re in
 detail, we’re going to describe our architecture,
 and how we solve some of these problems, make it a lot
 easier for developers to
 build solutions over the platform without worrying about
 the
 implementation details, and that’s the whole sort of
 advantage, you know, of our
 solution is to actually eliminate some of the worst or most
 challenging aspects
 of distributed computing. Yeah, it sounds like some of the
 tools are coming out, I
 described earlier as being kind of second-generation tools
 that are not only
 more powerful, but a little friendlier to use, and I know
 you’re the CEO or founder of
 Enterprise Web, and what, what is it about your product
 that answers that solution, or
 that need? Yeah, that’s a great question, and I think that
‘s true actually, I think
 there’s two things, I think it’s, there’s a maturity on the
 vendor side, and also on
 the market side, right, I think people have, you know,
 already scraped their
 knees a couple times, bruised themselves quite a bit. They
 know what they, it didn’t work. Yeah, they know it doesn’t
 work, they don’t believe hype really anymore, right, you
 know. Yeah, you can’t just say the cloud. Yeah, yeah, that
 didn’t work anymore. So, now, now actually what people are
 looking for is a
 real solutions that they can test at scale, and that solve
 real complex
 problems. So, it’s exciting time, because actually, you
 know, we’re talking about
 problems of computer science, actually, that people have
 been struggling with for 30
 years. These aren’t just problems of our moment, they’re,
 we’re actually
 pioneering now how to be fully distributed in real-time,
 data-driven,
 right, and, and keep that cohesive, right, because that
 could easily fly away from
 you if you don’t have it under control. Right. So, to your
 question about, you know, how do we make that more
 friendly, you know, first of all, the system is fully
 declarative, and we adopt a paradigm that’s
 probably the most friendliest paradigm for all developers,
 is the system
 actually acts like a library, right. The system essentially
 makes all of your
 endpoints, whether they’re the remote objects, micros
ervices, APIs, or web
 services, or in-process objects that actually live inside
 our system, that might be data
 models, process models, policy models, and it makes them
 all look the same. It creates
 a consistency layer. It creates one loosely coupled, well-
understood, you know,
 layer, and it’s horizontally scalable. A lot, think of it
 as a logical store, but it’s not just data,
 it’s data, code, diverse objects, right, and by creating a
 consistency layer, we make everything
 look the same, and it’s an abstraction, right, it’s a data
 abstraction inside our system. Everything
 looks the same. If everything looks the same, I can
 navigate it the same way. I can search it the
 same way. I can reason over it across the same way. So, I
 can now be, you know, searching,
 declarative, right through the UI. I can actually be
 walking relationships between objects that
 don’t actually live anywhere near each other. Right. They
‘re completely diverse, but in the
 system, it’s gonna look like, wow, I’m gonna, I’m gonna
 look at the mic object, and you’re an entity in our system,
 and I see every application you’ve ever touched. I click
 into an application, I could see an
 instance that you worked on. I can see the data and code
 behind that instance. I can actually click
 into the, the models of the remote objects that might have
 been, I can actually see the version
 of the policy that applied on the day that you did that
 transaction, and I do that front to back,
 and that kind of tracing, dependency mapping, library kind
 of access is probably the most
 friendly thing you could do to a developer, because then
 everything else is gravy. Yeah,
 because the discoverability is always the challenge. I mean
, we want from WSDL and SOAP, which at least
 you had this manifest that you could look at and say, well,
 this is what my, my methods, you know,
 my SOAP calls look like, and this is the interaction I can
 expect to Rust, which is, well, it’s kind of
 a shape, but people kind of had their own shape of a shape,
 you know, and didn’t always quite conform
 to kind of the nebulous vision of, I mean, I’m sure, you
 know, if he got really deep into it,
 Rust had a very concrete definition, but it wasn’t really
 discoverable. Sounds like this is answering
 some of those problems of when I sit down and I look at an
 environment and like, what can I do here?
 Yeah, absolutely. And it is the big, big problem of shared
 understanding, right? How do clients and
 servers understand each other, right? And how do diverse
 objects declare themselves to a system so
 they can be managed, right? Because in 2015, and we still,
 you know, when these people say continuous
 integration, right, that’s talked about a lot here,
 continuous delivery, continuous integration. The
 word they forget to leave out, the silent word between
 continuous and integration is manual.
 Right? You know, look at the API, read the API, wire the
 API into my process and app. So from the
 process and app layer, everything looks still ugly, right?
 You know, it’s only in the service and API
 abstraction layer does, oh, look, it’s all loosely coupled.
 It’s so nice. And look at that, you know,
 like I’ve liberated things from my systems. That actually
 is great. It is an advance. We’ve achieved
 some loose coupling. But when we’re doing three-tier
 vertical integration at the apps and the process
 layer, we’re nowhere. We have you just, we’ve moved the
 ball. Yeah, we’re still tying things together.
 The funny part about it is I think 10 years from now,
 people, you know, people will be like, you did
 what to what? You manually integrated that, right? So we’re
 actually automating interoperability
 itself because we do everything declaratively. Once your
 objects are declared in our system and
 you can now navigate them, I can now compose them in this
 one system by point and click by
 metadata because everything’s described in its metadata.
 And you as a developer, you can pick up
 any individual object, look at its dependencies, you could
 fully understand it. You could see
 everything that’s consuming it and et cetera. But at
 runtime, you don’t have to worry about
 that. You don’t, you don’t have to wire it into an app. An
 app just has to point to it and the system
 agents will go out and figure out all the dependencies or
 requirements to fulfill that
 contract and render the value back up to the application
 process. Sounds like a really hard
 problem. It was a big problem. We took two years. So we’re
 a lean startup. We’ve taken new capital.
 We’re profitable on our own. We’re customers on four
 continents. We just signed a deal with one
 of the world’s largest consulting firms. We can’t announce
 a point yet. That’s building a practice
 for differentiated solutions. We took the first two years
 of our company, no pay. We didn’t seek any
 customers just to work out the abstractions because we knew
 a lot of people were biting off. There’s a
 lot of companies out there, right? And a lot of people are
 biting off small chunks of a problem,
 but distributed computing is a big problem. And if you only
 bite off a chunk, you’re just adding
 another component to a complex architecture already. Right.
 Like I said, we really need
 a layer, right? We need an enterprise web. I need a way to
 wrap the enterprise in this
 thin veneer, right? Middleware shouldn’t be a stack, right?
 Middleware should be this thin,
 horizontal layer between my objects and the behavior I want
. Right. And that’s really
 accessible to developers. It’s a different way of thinking,
 but they know libraries,
 they understand dependencies, and if they can do all this
 declaratively and they can focus on
 new connections and business value, then I think that’s a
 win. Great. Well, thank you very much
 for taking the time to speak with me. I appreciate it.
 Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it.</p>

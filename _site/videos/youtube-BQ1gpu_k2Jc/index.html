      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi.
 It’s Mike with UGtastic.
 I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015 and I’m standing here with Jay
 Fields, who gave a talk on unselfish
 testing.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
 So unselfish testing, what does that mean and where did it
 come from?
 Sure.
 So I used to be a consultant with ThoughtWorks.
 I was there for several years and worked with a lot of
 clients and a lot of people that
 were a lot smarter than me, much more senior than me,
 learned a lot from them, and then
 worked with a lot of junior people just coming out of
 college.
 And I noticed that people spent a lot of time testing, not
 necessarily always very effectively.
 And so I just looked for patterns that I thought would make
 people more effective.
 And those turned into blog posts, which eventually turned
 into a book, which eventually turned
 into presenting today.
 But unselfish, what does that mean?
 Sure.
 It’s thinking about the team.
 Whenever say you practice TDD, and so your workflow is you
 sit down and you write a failing
 test, and then you fix the test, maybe you refactor, but
 you ever notice the emphasis
 is always on refactoring of the code.
 Nobody ever says, “Well, okay, spend some time on the test
.”
 And so you’re being selfish at that point.
 If you’re only working on writing code for the feature that
 you’re currently working
 on, you’re really only thinking about yourself.
 You’re thinking about delivering that individual feature.
 So unselfish testing is about creating tests that are more
 maintainable for the entire
 team.
 So I may write this test and I may quit, and six months
 down the road, you’re tasked with
 fixing a test because the domain has changed or something’s
 changed.
 And now you have a broken test that I wrote for my purposes
 that I didn’t really think
 about you.
 I was selfish.
 So you have a test that you have to spend more time
 debugging.
 So in my presentation, I actually show a really kind of a
 selfish test, and it takes you 10
 minutes, 10 steps, it’s really 10 minutes and 10 steps just
 to get to the expected value
 of the test.
 Yeah.
 It’s so funny that that’s so appropriate.
 Because I hadn’t really articulated that.
 I look at open source projects, and one of the first things
 I do when I’m trying to understand
 what they’re doing is go look at the test, and I was just
 feeling the pain looking at
 a library yesterday, saying, “What is the call?
 How do I call the certain method in their little DSL?”
 But when I looked at it, they actually had YAML that was
 loaded, and then they did some
 reflection on their own API, which caused the tests to
 execute and validate that it
 worked, which is great.
 But they didn’t tell me anything about how or why it worked
.
 Now I’m trying to parse whether I’m dealing with their DSL
 or I’m dealing with a DSL that’s
 in the test framework.
 And that’s not an RSpec thing, that’s just their metapro
gramming around generating a
 bunch of data.
 Sure.
 Yeah, that’s a common problem is you write a test, and you
 think, “Okay, well, I have
 a lot of different ideas.
 How do I abstract some of this out and kind of put it in a
 common place?”
 And if you have an idea that kind of flows throughout your
 entire test suite, then it’s
 great to abstract.
 Because you coming in, you look at the first test, and you
‘re kind of lost, and then you
 find the abstractions, but those are valuable across the
 whole test suite, and that’s good.
 But if you come in, and there’s a grouping of tests, just a
 couple different tests, and
 they have to connect to read some YAML or go through some
 specific DSL, and then you
 spend all of this time reading, just trying to figure out
 the test, and that doesn’t even
 help you with the underlying open source library.
 You’re just trying to understand this test, and the person
 who wrote it, they probably
 wrote something that’s very sophisticated and not too hard
 to work with.
 Mm-hmm.
 If you know what you’re doing.
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
 Right?
 But when you come to it fresh…
 Yeah.
 It’s a different world.
 Yeah.
 Especially, like, this was a DSL that I was…or they had a
 DSL for the configuration, so it’s
 already there.
 There’s that overhead of trying to just figure out how they
‘re doing the DSL.
 Right.
 Much less which method do I call to register XYZ with the
 framework, and it’s like, “Oh,
 man.”
 Meanwhile, you just want to learn the framework.
 Right.
 You don’t want to learn how clever they were in their tests
.
 Yeah.
 And that’s really the problem with a lot of the stuff you
 see out there, is people are
 very clever in their tests.
 Mm-hmm.
 But they don’t realize that that cleverness does not help
 future maintainers, until you
 internalize it, but you’re forcing someone to internalize
 it.
 Right.
 Right?
 They have no choice but to internalize all of that compl
ication.
 Yeah, and if they’re just coming to an API, and they’ve got
 a task to do, and they’re
 trying to just say, “Oh, how can I use this thing to do my
 task,” then they have to spend
 hours just to figure out, “Oh, no, it’s not going to work.”
 Yeah.
 You know?
 And I don’t think anyone’s doing it maliciously.
 Yeah.
 It’s just, like, before, we didn’t even write tests.
 Mm-hmm.
 And then we all kind of dove in to just writing tests all
 the time, and nobody took a step
 back.
 And not enough people, in my opinion, took a step back and
 said, “Why are we writing
 this test?
 You know, did it help us write the code?
 Well, that’s a different test, maybe, than did it help us
 maintain the code?”
 And maybe even that is different than documentation or
 having someone come fresh to a framework
 and try to understand it.
 They’re different tests.
 And it sounds like the kind of problem that Gherkin and Cuc
umber were trying to solve
 in a way where they were shooting at using these
 descriptive steps to say, like, “This
 is what it’s supposed to do.”
 I mean, of course, there was some complexity.
 I mean, in the background to actually do the thing, but, I
 mean, do you touch on that at
 all in your talk, how some frameworks seem to be trying to
 make things a little bit more
 human on the surface, at least?
 Or is that…
 I didn’t really touch on it.
 I mean, but I have opinions on it, obviously.
 You know, I think teams should basically just work with
 what makes them successful.
 But I don’t think anybody should adopt that stuff thinking
 it’s the silver bullet.
 Or…
 No.
 I don’t think anybody should adopt that.
 I’m saying, “Okay, we’re gonna make this so that it’s human
 readable first and then machine
 implement.”
 I think it’ll vary by team.
 Some teams will benefit from that and maybe they’ll use it
 for documentation.
 There are teams that have a lot of success with kind of BDD
-style stuff, but it’s not
 for everyone.
 There are also people who want just concise, no-nonsense,
 maintainable tests, don’t care
 about generating documentation, don’t care about using the
 tests for customer collaboration.
 And that’s what it comes down to.
 You have to…
 What’s your motivator?
 Right.
 What’s the point of the Gherkin test if only programmers
 are ever gonna look at it?
 Right.
 Is it really helpful?
 Because programmers know Ruby better than they know reading
 regexes of strings turned
 into Ruby.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And also, just kind of going a little further, thinking
 about, as you were talking about
 having these really creative tests and maybe refactor to
 the hilt, I mean, is maybe DRY
 not necessarily the best thing when you’re inside of a test
?
 Yeah.
 I mean, that’s definitely strong in my talk.
 It really depends on the team.
 But I would say the larger the team, the less DRY or being
 dry is the appropriate choice.
 Because the larger the team, the more likely you are to run
 into a test that you’ve never
 seen before.
 Well, I guess it makes sense what context we’re talking
 about.
 Within an individual test, obviously, you don’t wanna
 repeat ideas.
 Right.
 And within an entire test suite, say, some type of factory
 that creates all of your test
 instances, that creates a test instance with default values
.
 Right.
 Very helpful, obviously.
 And used throughout everywhere.
 So, DRY that up and reuse it everywhere.
 It’s one concept.
 Reused everywhere.
 That’s great.
 Right.
 But when you say, “Well, this group of tests in this file
 is one thing, and this
 is another thing, and this is another thing, and for this
 group, these parts of setup are
 applied, and for this group, these parts of setup are
 applied,” but that’s not really
 true.
 Setup is always applied everywhere.
 Right.
 And so, you have that conceptual overhead, and then any
 helper methods you have, there’s
 more overhead, and I don’t…
 If you’re the person that wrote it, and you’re the only
 person that ever maintains the code,
 then that’s probably fine.
 Dry it out however you want, because it’s gonna be your
 mental model, and just go with
 it.
 Right.
 No criticisms there.
 But if you work on, say, a 10-person team, and you start
 drying things out, and hiding
 a little complexity over here, and hiding a little
 complexity over here, you’re not
 really reducing complexity.
 You’re just hiding it in different places.
 And so now, when that test is broken, you’re forcing me not
 only to understand that complexity,
 but I have to go find it as well.
 Right.
 So, I find that frustrating and selfish.
 So, what would be something that…
 As somebody who’s sitting down and looking at implementing
 a test suite around a new
 product, what are maybe some rules of thumb that they might
 want to have in mind as they’re
 kind of contemplating writing their test suite?
 First thing is just know your motivators.
 Know what’s really important to you.
 Do you want to do TDD?
 Okay, well, that means you should, I don’t know, write a
 test for everything, but just
 start there.
 Okay, so now I have a motivator that’s gonna cause me to
 write a test for everything.
 Great.
 What is code coverage?
 I’m not really a fan of 100% code coverage, but some people
 are.
 That’s gonna be a motivator for some of your tests.
 If you’re not 100% code coverage, then you probably don’t
 need to, say, test the methods
 of a framework that you’re using.
 Right.
 They’re probably already tested, right?
 So, know your motivators.
 I mean, the motivator of customer acceptance is another
 common one.
 Your manager told you to is another common one.
 There are a lot of reasons that people write tests, so the
 first thing, just know what
 direction your motivators are even putting you in.
 So, let’s say that you only care about TDD for design, and
 another way that I like to
 look at my tests is RR.
 R-O-I, return on investment, and so, say, you only care
 about TDD, and you only care
 about ROI.
 So, cool.
 TDD everything.
 Get the benefits of TDD and get your improved design, you
 know, everything that everybody’s
 been talking about with TDD.
 Do that.
 But just ‘cause you wrote a test doesn’t mean that it has
 to stay there.
 Right.
 Right?
 It doesn’t need to live there.
 Instead, I look at my tests, I prefer to look at my tests
 through ROI, and so every test
 has an ROI, negative or positive.
 And so, say you write a test, say you’re an insurance
 company, and you need to look your
 customers up.
 Buy social security number.
 So, social needs to be correct, so you have a validation on
 social, but you don’t need
 to get correct that they have no integers in their name,
 because there’s no business
 value in keeping integers out of a name other than maybe,
 you know, one in a hundred, one
 in a million.
 You get a customer who’s annoyed ‘cause you put an integer
 in there, but they’re not gonna
 cancel their insurance ‘cause you put an integer in their
 name, right?
 Right.
 So, you don’t necessarily need a test for that, but maybe
 you still TDD the feature,
 verifying that there’s no integers in the name, you TDD it,
 and you get the good design benefits,
 delete the test, because if that gets broken, if there is a
 regression, it’s minimal impact
 to the business.
 Yeah.
 Actually, you brought up the next question I was gonna ask
 about culling tests, and that
 a lot of teams I’ve seen will take a test and treat it like
 it’s a sync or synced thing
 that can never be, like, once it’s implemented, you can’t
 touch it, and just sometimes I look
 at tests and I’m like, “Why are we even testing this?
 It doesn’t matter.”
 Yeah.
 And people are afraid to delete it, because they don’t know
 why they’re testing it, and
 why does it matter?
 Yeah.
 And I don’t know what my motivation for testing is.
 Maybe I can’t delete that, because it’s 100% code coverage,
 or, you know, my manager said
 this area needs to be 100% or something like that, but most
 of the time that’s not the
 case.
 Most of the time it’s just like, “Well, this is a test, so
 I can’t possibly delete it,”
 because, you know, imagine what would go wrong if somebody
 found out I deleted it.
 Yeah.
 But if you think about it, you know, really, if I deleted a
 test that was stopping
 a regression, and we had that regression, and it had almost
 no or no impact to the business,
 then it’s really not a big deal, right?
 Right.
 So you mentioned that you have authored a book.
 What’s your book title?
 “Working Effectively with Unit Tests.”
 “Working Effectively with Unit Tests.”
 Yeah.
 And is that a Java-centric book, or is it general purpose?
 I would say it’s general purpose, but it’s Java examples,
 which I know it’s hard for
 some people to swallow.
 I personally love dynamic languages, but I wanted to make
 it accessible to the most people,
 so Java seemed like the good default choice.
 Okay.
 So it was “Working Effectively with Unit Tests.”
 “Working Effectively with Unit Tests.”
 “Working Effectively with Unit Tests.”
 It’s on LeanPub, so DRM-free.
 Okay.
 All the good programmer stuff.
 All right, great.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 Appreciate it.
 Thanks a lot.
 Yep.</p>

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015 and I
‘m sitting here with
 Dimitri who gave a talk about the data grid, well, bigger
 than the data grid.
 Beyond the data grid. Beyond the data grid with Apache Ign
ite. Well, first I want to say
 thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me
 and you can tell me a
 little bit about what your presentation was about and what
 is this Apache
 Ignite product. All right, thank you Mike. So yeah, I want
 you to notice I’m
 wearing an Apache Ignite t-shirt, first of all, so it’s
 very cool. So whenever you
 see green t-shirts, I want you to know it’s Apache Ignite.
 So I just gave a talk
 about Apache Ignite. So it’s an Apache project, currently
 undergoing
 incubation process at Apache, but I’m getting a feeling it
‘s gonna graduate
 pretty soon, probably within a couple of months. And what
 it is, it’s a memory data
 fabric and essentially you use Apache Ignite whenever you
 face performance or
 scalability problems within your application. And at that
 point you decide to
 introduce an in-memory architecture, you want to cache a
 lot of data. You’re gonna
 be faced with quite a few use cases, but a lot of them are
 common and we see it
 for every project that moves in memory. For example, you
 are going to have some
 clustering, you are going to have some scale out,
 horizontal scalability issues,
 you are going to probably want to cache data in memory,
 maybe partition or shard
 data in memory, and you probably want to transact on that
 data or maybe query
 that data. You may want to stream that data into the system
 or continuously
 ingest large amounts of data into the system and use
 streaming,
 maybe computing using distributed MapReduce, or for joint
 type APIs. So all
 of those components are available within Apache Ignite in-
memory data fabric. So
 from the get-go, we wanted Apache Ignite to
 become a one-point solution for most of the in-memory use
 cases, and that’s
 why we cover most of these use cases. However, the project
 is still very simple
 to use. It comes as one zip file. You just unzip it off
 your go. It uses all the
 standard APIs, probably you’re most familiar with in Java,
 like maps, queues,
 sets, most of the concurrent Java Util concurrent APIs are
 also ported to
 Apache Ignite, ThreadPool, distributed executor service.
 All of those standard
 APIs are still used within Apache Ignite. So is Apache Ign
ite a database competitor to
 a NoSQL database, or is it a layer that sits between
 applications and
 persistent data stores? That’s a good question actually. So
 the answer is it’s
 probably not a simple yes or no answer, because if you look
 at distributed cache
 within Apache Ignite, it is a key value store. So from that
 standpoint, you can
 think about it from a NoSQL standpoint, because you’re
 working with basic Java
 objects. It’s a key value store. However, Ignite has full
 SQL capabilities, and it
 allows you to index those, index inside of those objects.
 For example, your class
 names become tables, your fields inside of the classes
 become columns, and from
 there, and then you can create indexes in memory, and you
 can start querying it
 using standard SQL. So from one side, you can think about
 it as NoSQL, but it does
 provide SQL. It’s SQL for NoSQL. SQL for NoSQL, there you
 go, that’s a good way to put it. What does it provide, like
 a
 way to write back to persistence, or is it always only in
 memory? Actually, it does.
 It does provide, it does automatically write through to a
 persistent store, so if you
 have like an Oracle database or MySQL database already
 installed, Ignite will
 automatically integrate with that data store, automatically
 will detect all the
 indexes and put them in memory, or if you can also
 integrate it, put it on top of
 NoSQL disk-based databases like Mongo, React, Couchbase, or
 Cassandra for that matter, and it will
 also work on top of those as well. So it sounds like an
 extremely advanced caching
 layer that provides some direct query capabilities that you
 can save a call to
 the actual persistent on-disk databases. That sounds about
 right for the data
 grid portion. However, as I mentioned, Ignite is a fabric.
 Data grid and distributed
 caching is just one component, and it probably is the
 biggest component within
 Ignite, and that’s where most of the people actually will
 use.
 But there’s also streaming of data, there’s also sliding
 window support,
 there’s also distributed map reduce for joint kind of
 computations, so it
 provides a lot more than just that. But yeah, from a data
 grid standpoint, it’s a
 fairly feature-rich project. Okay, and I’m going to ask you
 to just move a little bit. The project
 itself, I mean, how did you go about, is it something that
 you kind of cooked up
 from projects you were working on or some thesis? Where did
 the idea come to exist?
 All right, so actually I’m one of the co-founders of GridG
ain systems. So we
 started out probably seven or eight years ago, and that
 time we wanted, we had
 a dream of creating this easy-to-use grid computing system.
 And we started from
 compute grid, and probably three years down the road we
 added data grid
 capabilities to it. And GridGain actually always had an
 open-source component, open-source version, and also there
 was an
 enterprise version. And in September of last year we
 decided to donate code to Apache
 Software Foundation. So it started going through incubation
 in Apache, and we are,
 I’m hoping, approaching the graduation in Apache as well.
 So what is the process? I mean, when you
 have an idea and you want to spin out an open-source
 project, do you just, did you
 go straight to Apache? Or was it that you had a project
 that you released and
 Apache contacted you and said, “Hey, let’s pull this in.”
 How did that, how did you end up
 with Apache then? So, well, I mean, there are two parts to
 the question.
 We wanted to join Apache because we wanted to grow
 community around
 open-source projects. So once you join Apache, you become
 part of this Apache
 process, what they call an Apache way, which is very
 community friendly. It
 introduces all sorts of outside contributions. So right now
, believe it or
 not, we have, it used to be only GridGain commuters, we
 probably have more
 outside contributors working on Ignite than from the side
 of GridGain. So you
 get community growth. But however, Apache does not pull the
 code in. It
 will take your code, it will take your project and make
 sure you grow community
 around it, make sure you work with it the open-source way.
 But it will not
 take the code. You’re still managing it. So you’re still
 responsible for the project development.
 But it’s just that it’s kind of sold through the Apache
 marketplace. No, it’s actually more
 of an Apache way. I mean, that’s what it’s called. It’s
 Apache way, which is very open
 everything. All the discussions happen in the open. All the
 tickets happen in the
 open. All the design discussions and future of the project
 is all in the open
 and everybody is equal. It doesn’t belong to one person. It
 belongs to the
 community now. Okay, and when you describe you’re in an
 incubation phase, how
 do you go from incubation and what’s the difference between
 incubation and being,
 well, not an incubation? Top-level project, you graduate.
 So the difference would be
 that, from a product standpoint, there’s a very little
 difference. From an Apache
 standpoint, you have to, first of all, license compliance.
 You have to only have certain
 allowed licenses in your project, like definitely Apache 2.
0 is allowed as a license. There’s
 BSD license and MIT licenses are allowed. Then you have to
 have a well-oiled build procedure,
 well-oiled community process set up within Apache.
 So once you actually show that you can work with an open-
source community and follow this
 kind of path, at that point you’re ready to graduate. And
 usually that happens when
 you do like two or three releases under Apache. So we’re
 currently on two. I think
 after the third one we will be ready to graduate. We’re
 already complying. We’re
 already embracing the Apache way. Okay, well thank you very
 much for taking the
 time to speak with me and for supporting open-source. Thank
 you. Thanks.</p>

      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015. I’m
 sitting here with
 Jerry Cattell, who is one of the organizers with the
 Chicago DevOps Group.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
 So Chicago DevOps,
 how did you get involved in that? And what is the DevOps
 group?
 Sure, I mean DevOps in general, at least I mean you can ask
 anyone, they’ll have
 different definitions. For me it’s generally about sort of
 breaking down
 silos and getting everyone in the company to sort of
 alignment and trying
 to achieve the same goals instead of development and
 operations sort of
 fighting each other historically. So yeah, I’ve been
 involved with the
 organization for I guess about three years now. Okay, so it
‘s been around a little while.
 Yeah, it’s actually been around probably for five years or
 so. Okay. It was
 registered with the actual meetup.com/devops. It was the
 first one.
 Yeah, that’s a coveted title.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, so Martin Logan registered that long ago and yeah, he
 was the original
 creator of it. And yeah, it’s, I basically got involved
 because I’ve always sort of
 straddled the line between development and operations and
 database
 administration. So for me it was just finally finding a
 place that I kind of
 belonged. But in general, I think it’s a lot more about
 just improving the whole
 process of developing software at a company and stream
lining that.
 And you mentioned that, you know, the group’s been around
 longer than you’ve been a part of.
 So, and now you’re an organizer, you know, so what brought
 you to the group?
 And then what kind of encouraged you to want to invest time
 into helping run the
 group? Sure. I mean, well, I went to a couple of them
 before, but like it just
 as an attendee to the meetups and always thought it was
 very interesting. Then
 Martin left to go to Seattle. Yeah. Leaving sort of a void.
 And so I had
 missed the talks on those subjects. And then so I thought,
 well, I might as well
 see if I can help on that. And yeah, I mean, I basically
 decided to put in the
 time just because I think it’s a great group of people that
 attend the meetups
 and I tend to learn a ton just from hearing how they’re
 solving their
 problems. Like any meetup group, I mean, you just want to
 understand, you know, how do
 you solve this problem that I’m having at work right now.
 What are you doing? And also, I mean, because as the
 organizer, part of your job is to find good speakers and
 stuff. And so a lot of
 that has been just sort of me being able to reach out
 beyond our community and
 actually start to talk to people that I would have never
 introduced myself to
 just, you know, at a crowd or a conference. I might not
 have talked to them in the
 past, but now as the organizer, I’m like, okay, now I
 actually have a reason.
 That’s an excellent point. And that’s actually one of the
 things that I’ve
 discovered as with UGtastic is you have a reason to go up
 to people that
 you’re like, oh, I went to a conference and somebody gave a
 presentation. Okay,
 great. And then you just go off and do your business. But
 if you’re a user
 group organizer, now you have, you know, a reason. Like,
 hey, would you come to our
 group? Yeah, it’s like, I really enjoyed your talk and I’d
 love for you to give
 that talk to like the local community now. Right, right.
 From wherever I might
 be seeing them talk. And yeah, it’s a, so that’s been one
 of the huge benefits
 of being an organizer is just meeting all these amazing
 people. Yeah, it’s open
 doors. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And speaking of other
 community events, you
 mentioned there’s this DevOps Day, which you got the shirt
 on for. What is
 DevOps Days? So DevOps Days, it’s been around for about
 five, almost six years
 now. Yeah. The first one took place in Ghent in 2009 and
 that was just sort of
 the start of it all. It’s now been, I think, over 50 events
 worldwide. Chicago
 first held DevOps Days, they had their first DevOps Days
 last year. Okay. And so
 we’re doing it all again this year in August 25th and 26th.
 So yeah, so it’s…
 Is it a multi-day conference? Yeah, it’s a two-day
 conference. It’s got presentations,
 it’s got Ignite talks, it’s got open spaces. So it’s like a
 good mix of lots
 of things. It’s a much more participatory conference than
 the standard one
 where you just sort of go and listen to someone talk. It’s
 much more about actually
 voicing the things you care about and actually talking to
 each other. Yeah. It’s
 not the lecture style. No, not at all. So it’s definitely a
 great conference that I
 love going to. And so when we finally got one here in
 Chicago, we were thrilled and
 then we had a great response last year, so we decided to do
 it again this year. So if
 I just Google DevOps Days? DevOpsDays.org will get you to
 the main website and from
 all our stuff. And right now, actually, our call for
 proposals is open, so anyone
 who wants to do that. Okay, so DevOps Days and then it’s,
 you said it runs in
 several cities and different states at different times?
 Yeah, I mean, Austin was
 just last week. I think Toronto was actually this week. Oh,
 so it’s all over the
 place. Yeah, and like I know Minneapolis is in July. We’re
 in August. Yeah, and
 they’re just great events to go to. Okay, great. Well,
 thank you very much for
 taking the time to speak with me. Thank you. Appreciate it.

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    
      <div class="video-transcript"><p>Hi, it’s Mike with UGtastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf 2015. I
‘m standing here with Matthew Brender, who gave a talk on
 how to navigate unstructured data.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.
 So, navigating unstructured data, where did this talk come
 from and what was it about?
 Sure. So, I’m here on behalf of Basho, my employer, and we
‘re the creators of React, a distributed NoSQL database,
 which fundamentally breaks some basic concepts when you’ve
 come from a relational world like we all do.
 So, I’ve been doing some research on, okay, first off, what
 type of data is unstructured versus something that fits
 more naturally into a relational database?
 And secondly, what are some of the actual system architect
ures that people are taking into effect and trying to
 achieve with their infrastructure,
 as opposed to having these segmented groupings and data
 pushing here and there?
 Just pulling there and refactoring here and there, trying
 to have more of a raw event stream that results in a repeat
able sequence of events that you can analyze after the fact.
 I’m fascinated by that. There are a few different architect
ures that I reviewed.
 Okay. So, with the unstructured data, I mean, is React a
 document store database or is it, I mean, NoSQL is such a
 broad term.
 Yeah, and that was part of the thing we have to tackle,
 right? Like, you hear NoSQL and you don’t know what to
 assume.
 You just know that it’s not rows and columns.
 So, key value is the simplest form. That is, in fact, what
 React is.
 But I also went over columnar and graph databases and how
 they fit different goals.
 But what’s great about a key value database and
 particularly an AP key value database that is sacrificing
 some consistency state for in order to have a growing level
 of availability in an architecture,
 you find some nuances about that that are a little
 different.
 That are really effective for companies that are growing
 and the amount of data that they’re consuming.
 Okay. I mean, and compared to like another really big
 player in that key value source, you know, Redis, I mean,
 how does Redis and React, I mean, do they serve different
 purposes or?
 Yeah, exactly. They’re very complementary.
 So, I’d say a decent to a significant portion of our
 customers also use Redis side by side because Redis is key
 value, but what it does is keeps everything.
 I mean, you can use Redis to do both the data and the
 mapping of that data in memory, and you can perform set
 functionality on the data and actually aggregate it on the
 fly as you need it from your application.
 So, it makes an ideal read cache, but what it doesn’t offer
 is any sort of guarantee on availability in the sense of
 durability in the case of a failure of a node.
 So, Redis right now, to the best of my knowledge, it’s
 actually a master-slave architecture, so you have multiple
 systems and they own portions of the structure.
 So, Redis is the best way to do that, but it’s also the
 best way for us to keep track of what’s going on in the
 process and keep track of the data that we’re sharing.
 So, Redis is the best way to do that, but it’s also the
 best way for us to keep track of the data that we’re
 sharing.
 What makes React and Cassandra and others like us really
 interesting is that data is evenly distributed over a
 consistent hashing table, meaning each node has a
 consistent amount of information and it’s durable.
 It’s written to disk before you get that acknowledgement,
 but that’s still on a very lightweight millisecond
 transaction standpoint as opposed to something that could
 be much larger.
 Okay. And so, you know, did you come to React through the
 open source?
 I mean, did you come to React through the open source?
 Did you come to Bashow through the React open source, or
 have you been working with React more because of being a
 Bashow employee?
 No, it’s very much the latter.
 I was not at all familiar with databases.
 I’m going to drift in a little bit.
 Just go.
 We have to stand uncomfortably close.
 You good?
 No, I’m comfortable.
 I’m comfortable.
 Okay.
 As long as you’re comfortable, we’re good.
 Fine.
 All right, great.
 Okay.
 So, I came to React through my work.
 I joined Bashow because I have a lot of respect and
 admiration for the leadership and the
 product.
 Every single person I spoke to said the product is rock
 solid, is by far really respected in
 the industry, and I came on to focus on more of our open
 source contribution strategy,
 and I’ve been learning distributed systems from scratch,
 actually, since I’ve joined.
 So, I didn’t know databases.
 I didn’t know distributed systems.
 I’ve got computer science background and system
 architecture background and just kind of keep
 building the skill set like we all do.
 It’s one of those things that it’s the employer wants
 somebody who’s smart and can learn things.
 So, you went through that route.
 Well, you got the smart part down, so let’s see what you
 can learn.
 So, with React, I mean, I know that Bashow has been really
 involved with supporting local
 community and being part of the go-to events over the years
.
 When you go to an event, just curious about it as an
 evangelist, what is it like going to speak about React at
 so many different
 conferences and touching so many different communities?
 Yeah, no, it’s a great question, and I want to separate it
 into two points.
 One is the title.
 I actually full-heartedly reject the title of an evangelist
 because an evangelist to me presupposes that I am the
 expert and you should be listening to me at all times.
 I am a developer advocate at Bashow, and it’s minor, but it
‘s important to me because it more focuses on how do I cur
ate other people’s information and their skills and grow
 with them.
 As opposed to be the one that’s already at some destination
 that other people are trying to get to.
 That model doesn’t work very well for me, and what that
 allows me to do is I get to come in and be very honest and
 upfront that I have some naiveness to my ability to build
 these systems.
 I read voraciously about how people are, and then I just
 try to connect the dots and make sure other people can
 solve it with me.
 So it’s really honest.
 I get to be very honest.
 I get to interact with people who are at all sorts of
 phases, either.
 Experts have been running with NoSQL since it was invented
 to people that still don’t know what it means relative to
 big data and Internet of Things.
 So they see these trends and want to kind of unpack it.
 So you’ve been in a place where you’re like, no, React, you
 just use MySQL.
 Yeah, yeah.
 And that’s a pleasure is to really say, like, listen, you
 have what’s called a little data problem.
 Just put it in your favorite relational database and be
 done with it.
 You don’t need to scale like this.
 Yeah, yeah.
 And that honesty, that’s core to the culture at Basho and
 something I really respect and admire about the community
 around us.
 We solve a specific set of problems, and if you need that
 problem solved well, we feel we have the best by far
 solution to that.
 Great.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 I appreciate it.
 Yeah, my pleasure, Mike.
 It was great to do so and hang out with Shutter.
 Fluttershy.
 Fluttershy.
 You guys will see Fluttershy later.
 Thanks.
 Bye.</p>

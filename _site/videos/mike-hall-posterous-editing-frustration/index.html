  "description": "The unbelievably awesome Posterous experience encapsulated in four minutes of frustrated clicking.\nBasically, last night I was fighting with Posterous to make changes to a SCMC meeting announcement. I needed to add a sponsor image but wanted it to retain it's shape and be a clickable link. Posterous wants to load images into it's own format and will reduce them to a tiny, cropped square otherwise. But this session wouldn't even let me remove the image. I would edit, update and the content would be reset. I was working in Chromium and Firefox. Heck, when I open the dashboard in Firefox the post doesn't even appear until I force refresh.\nDon't watch it all the way to the end. The last 30 seconds or so was me trying to close Screeny but I have too many things in my status bar and it was hidden. :P",

 Okay. Hi, it’s Mike with Ute Tastic. I’m here at GOTO Conf
 2015 and I’m sitting here with Kyle Kingsbury who gave the
 opening keynote and its tagline was Hope Springs Eternal.
 Did I say that correctly? Okay. Well, thank you very much
 for taking the time to speak with me.
 What Hope Springs Eternal? What were you trying to implant
 as a message for your keynote?
 The message is basically that everything is broken and we
 should be crying in the corner.
 I came to deliver fire and ashes, but we’re wrapping it in
 a pretty happy package.
 It’s like we’re smiling. We’re all doomed.
 So in the previous Jepson talks, I’d gone through a number
 of databases and had found inconsistencies or cases of data
 loss.
 And in this talk, I wanted to come back to some of these
 databases because people are optimistic that they’ve fixed
 certain problems.
 And I wanted to measure whether or not those problems have
 been resolved and then see if there were new ones.
 Okay. So like the notorious Mongo missed write problem and
 things like that.
 So what were some of…
 Can you tell me your findings?
 So MongoDB in particular fixed their majority write issue,
 where if you would write at the strongest level of
 consistency,
 it could occasionally say that it had written data
 successfully and then lose it.
 Oh, okay.
 So that was fixed quickly and it was confirmed to be safe
 in the latest tests.
 Okay.
 I found a new issue, however, which is that it will allow
 you to read values from the past.
 So you can write something and then not see it anymore.
 And a later time it might show up.
 Well, I guess that’s the eventual part of eventually
 readable instead of eventually consistent.
 But it’ll show up.
 So there was just some latency issues that if you wrote and
 then read too fast, it might get stale data.
 Or you could also read garbage data.
 You could make a write that should not have succeeded.
 It would fail, but you might not know it failed.
 And then it would be visible for reads to that node.
 So that’s called read uncommitted.
 So both stale reads and dirty reads are sort of…
 …two complementary sides of the same phenomenon in Mongo.
 Okay.
 And what were some of the other databases?
 Did you look at MySQL and Postgres and Couch and React and
 all the other databases that are usually come up in these
 conversations?
 So I haven’t gone to test MySQL with Postgres replication.
 I did a very simple single node Postgres analysis, but it
 doesn’t show very much interesting beyond two generals.
 I did come back to look at Elasticsearch in this test,
 which previously lost data.
 But when a partition happened that left a node connecting
 two different components in the network,
 that particular behavior was known to be an issue, and the
 ticket was fixed.
 And in fact, it had reduced the window of data loss
 significantly.
 But there’s still some time when you can lose writes.
 Were you the person who authored those blog post articles
 doing the partition analysis on…
 Or was it Elasticsearch I’m thinking of?
 There was about missing data due to…
 Some latency inside of certain database scenarios.
 That could have been me, yeah.
 Okay.
 The Jepson series has been going on for a couple years now.
 And there’s a bunch of blog posts, and there’s a paper in
 ACMQ, and there’s the talks as well.
 Okay.
 And are there any databases that you’re just like, yeah,
 this database is good?
 Or is it always the…
 Well, it depends.
 You know, I think depending on what you’re building, you’re
 going to need various guarantees.
 Guarantees and various performance characteristics and
 various availability characteristics.
 So for a consistent metadata store, you might pick
 something like Zookeeper.
 Maybe etcd, although that’s a little newer, so I figure it
‘ll take a while to iron its mugs.
 In fact, Zookeeper, you know, over its, what, 10-year
 history has been ironing out bugs gradually.
 There was a really nice article from PagerDuty recently
 that discovered a particular confluence of unchecked checks
ums for GCP packets
 and some weird Xen anomalies that resulted in Zookeeper.
 So it’s like if you have an elbow here and this elbow here,
 it won’t write.
 Yeah, it’s really amazing.
 These are very difficult to get correct.
 Yeah, yeah.
 But Zookeeper, by and large, I think has hammered out a lot
 of the bugs.
 Well, and that’s one of the things I’ve heard an interview
 with one of the Postgres internals DB engine developers.
 And they basically described that it’s, especially with
 open source development on these tools,
 it’s very hard to get people to work on them that can
 actually effectively work with these problems
 because they’re hard problems that they’re solving.
 Oh, yes.
 I mean, so when you’re looking at databases, sometimes it
 feels like the older the better.
 Does that seem like a reasonable wisdom?
 Like if it’s been around 20 years, it’s probably pretty
 solid.
 Yeah, and the more use cases it’s seen, and as it gets to
 larger deployments,
 the more bugs you’ll run into enough that it was painful
 enough that somebody would go and fix it.
 But conversely, you know, old doesn’t necessarily mean safe
.
 There are well-established pieces of software with plenty
 of bugs in them.
 Yeah.
 Not a pen share.
 So just the word Jepson, what does that mean?
 What is Jepson?
 And how did, you know, you said it’s a series of articles,
 but it just seems like such a random word.
 What does that mean?
 Carly Rae Jepson is a Canadian pop star.
 Oh, okay.
 Who had this famous song, Call Me Maybe.
 It’s all about miscommunication and not knowing if the boy
 likes you or not.
 And to me, this speaks to distributed systems where you’re
 sending your operations into the,
 and hoping that messages come back that they understood you
, that they want to meet.
 That’s almost as subtle a pun as UGtastic.
 UGtastic.
 User group’s fantastic.
 But, yeah, it’s one of those when you finally hear the
 definition, you’re like, that’s awesome.
 Call me maybe.
 And it makes total sense when you hear it.
 Well, the blog posts are calling me Jepson, calling me El
asticsearch.
 Oh, okay.
 And then the hope springs eternal.
 That one was a little hard.
 Yeah, in the previous talk, there was a star.
 Yeah.
 There was a reference about building a Death Star, and so
 this is sort of playing on that.
 Okay.
 And did you happen to look at any other, like, we have
 several database providers here,
 like Neo4j, do your tests look at a variety of types of
 database stores,
 or are you mostly focused on NoSQL document stores,
 or is there a specific vertical style of database that you
 are focusing on with your Jepson series?
 I would like to, and I think the tools are capable of
 analyzing,
 all sorts of different things.
 Looking for SQL serializability anomalies is very tricky to
 do.
 The analyzer is slow, so it’s going to take more work, I
 think, before I can really do tests on things like Postgres
.
 But basic tests about insert safety and update safety for
 single rows, I think those should be amenable.
 And I’m actually hoping to do that in Postgres RDS next.
 Okay, great.
 So far, I’ve done things from consensus services like
 console and etcd to sort of horizontally scalable key value
 stores,
 like Cassandra and React, and then some SQL-style databases
 like NeoDB.
 Okay.
 So there’s a whole gamut.
 Great.
 Well, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with
 me.
 I appreciate it.
 Thank you.</p>

    <h2>The Brief</h2>
    <ul class="home-list">
      <li>Build systems that are easy to navigate and hard to lose.</li>
      <li>Respect the reader with clean markup and accessible structure.</li>
      <li>Keep the content canonical, linkable, and durable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Editorial Method</h2>
    <ul class="home-list">
      <li>Interviews and videos are indexed by stable IDs so links and metadata stay durable.</li>
      <li>Generated indexes are rebuilt from canonical data files, not hand-edited page fragments.</li>
      <li>Transcript quality and metadata completeness are monitored as operational work, not one-time cleanup.</li>
      <li>Curation tracks are explicit about scope and sequence so the archive reads as lineage, not a dump.</li>
    </ul>

In his talk, he discussed the importance of speed in innovation and how disruptions in industries often occur when an incumbent company makes assumptions about certain things being expensive or hard to do, only for a disrupter to come along and take advantage of those things becoming cheap and easy. Cockcroft used examples such as open source software and solid state disk storage to illustrate his points. He also talked about the shift in the software industry from traditional enterprise companies to end users being the source of the best, most reliable software.","prepareDate":"2023-02-04T11:47:02-06:00","previewImageURL":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gdd7Cp_ZANY\/maxresdefault.jpg","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gdd7Cp_ZANY"}

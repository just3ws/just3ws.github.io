He approaches his presentations by standing up in his apartment and pacing while talking for 30 to 45 minutes, making single word notes on slides as he goes. He then goes through a long refinement period to polish the content. Bernhardt doesn't outline his talks and instead relies on speaking and pacing to come up with the core message of his presentation. He also keeps a running list of ideas in a personal wiki and looks for trends among them to come up with topics for his talks. For his screencasts, Bernhardt usually silently performs a refactoring a few times and then records himself doing it if he finds it still interesting after repeating it a few times. He speaks candidly and honestly in his presentations and screencasts, and is known for his ability to simplify complex topics and make them accessible to a broad audience.","playlist":{"name":"Uploads from Mike Hall","totalCount":165,"index":5},"authors":["Mike Hall"],"prepareDate":"2023-02-04T12:18:13-06:00","bitrate":593,"uploadDate":"2022-01-07","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g6gFCr5isGg","previewImageURL":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/g6gFCr5isGg\/maxresdefault.jpg","title":"Interview with Gary Bernhardt creator \"Destroy All Software\" at SCNA Chicago","__version":"4.6.7"}

Every interview left something with me even if it was simply getting to spend a few moments with someone who felt passionate about their pursuits. This interview left me with a completely new angle on how to rationalize about _people_ that extended beyond my industry experiences. I highly recommend giving a listen to what Leon is telling us about how we can see our colleagues and the one's who came before from a new perspective.","__version":"4.6.7","height":360,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UIsjEX3DeDU","bitrate":429,"previewImageURL":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UIsjEX3DeDU\/maxresdefault.jpg","creationDate":"2023-02-04T17:45:46Z","__type":"com.charliemonroe.Downie.4.metadata","width":540}

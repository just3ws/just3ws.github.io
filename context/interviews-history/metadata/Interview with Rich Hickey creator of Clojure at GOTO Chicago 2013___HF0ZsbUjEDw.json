He released Clojure to the Lisp mailing list and it gained popularity through word of mouth and online communities. Hickey believes that the fact that Clojure runs on the stable and well-established JVM has contributed to its success, as it allows users to try something new while still maintaining a connection to the technologies they are familiar with. Hickey also discusses the importance of simplicity and concision in programming languages and the role of language design in enabling programmers to solve problems more effectively.","__type":"com.charliemonroe.Downie.4.metadata","creationDate":"2023-02-04T17:45:46Z","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HF0ZsbUjEDw","bitrate":615,"width":640,"height":480,"resolution":"640x480"}

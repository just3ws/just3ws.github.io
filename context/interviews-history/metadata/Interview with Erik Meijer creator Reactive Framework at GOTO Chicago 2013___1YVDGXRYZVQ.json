It was developed by Erik Meijer while he was working at Microsoft and has since become an open-source project. Rx provides a set of libraries and tools for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators. It is designed to allow developers to easily build responsive and resilient systems that can handle high volumes of data and handle failures gracefully. Rx is implemented in a number of programming languages, including C#, Java, and JavaScript, and has been widely adopted in the software industry.","__type":"com.charliemonroe.Downie.4.metadata","prepareDate":"2023-02-04T12:12:27-06:00"}

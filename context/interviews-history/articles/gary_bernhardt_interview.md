INTERVIEW WITH GARY


0:02 **Mike:** Hi I'm Mike again with Ugtastic, I'm at SC and A, now I'm sitting down with Gary Bernhardt who has created the destroyer. On destroyer all software screen caste series and he also just recently gave a talk here at SC and A. In previous interviews I've talked, I've had Gary style of presentation been called and Gay's going to get up and talk, he's going to drop some knowledge on you. And he has a unique way of presenting. I wanted to understand a little bit about how you approach your presentations and your speaking engagements and what influences you?

**Gary:** The way that I actually created talk for one thing, is I think very unusual. I certainly don't outline, I don't write. Usually what happens is I stand up in my apartment, start pasting and just start talking for about 30 to 45 minutes and I might stop and make single work notes on slides, just making slides for white back ground and black text single word. And after that I go through a very long refinement period. But just standing up and talking creates sort of the back bone of it. The pieces get shuffled but the core message is usually there and in a case where I'm proposing a talk. I'll actually do that before the proposal. So by the time you get my proposal, I already know I can deliver a full length talk and be happy with the content. As far as how I come up with topics. I have much less insight into this sorted out process, I just sort of come up with them.

1:33 **Mike:** I want to talk about X.

**Gary:** Sometimes I do, I'll keep a running wiki page up in my personal wiki. It's just ideas

And I'll see trends. So that's where my talk last year that scene I came from. This talk was a little more premeditated. I just wanted to focus on this idea of boundaries and values been boundary between opportunities but yeah sort of a very high level overview of how my looks.

2:00 **Mike:** Because last year was expansion and contraction, now this year is boundaries. Excuse me I just.

**Gary:** That was another pair of topics yes. So last year was actually a series of I think 7 or 8 dichotomies, expansion, contraction, capabilities, suitability, and several others I forgot.

2:18 **Mike:** Yeah I sort of remember one (unclear).

**Gary:** Yes so those were all related and then I tried to make a talk out of all them, found the ones that fit better, together the best. And I just sort of figured out how to turn that into a narrative by putting in the right word and adding some historical context. But there is usually a core idea like, I mean the core of capability and suitability was 3 pairs of words all together. The core of boundaries was just boundaries and values. The relationship between the boundary, between code and other code and how that relates to a value pass between code and other code. So there is always a core.

2:**54 Mike**: How, the value means how you correspond words?

**Gary:** Yes the value been the boundary itself, the thing that goes between two pieces of code for them to communicate as opposed to a block in shyncriness, massive sender or massive call. So there's usually a core sort of idea that's very simple and can be expressed in just a few words.

3:16**Mike**: With your destroyer all software series, is that a similar methodology that you use to come up with topics for that screen cast?

**Gary:** Sort of, it's a little different because destroyer all software are screen cast. I can't come up with things to say and I put images to them that would be me doing a talk. I practice talk every other week which I don't think would be worth my 9 dollars a month. Instead with a screen cast I usually sit down and just silently will go through it. There will be a refractor against the core that I want to be the core of a screen cast, I'll just do it silently a few times. And I feel like it's still interesting to me after doing it a couple times, then I'll pull out the micro phones, start recording and just start doing it. And I just, sometimes, the second time I do it, I'm already recording. I just do it all the way through over and over again until I feel good enough about it; I didn't make any major mistakes. I didn't have to back track, I didn't stumble over words. So it's similar in that I don't do up front planning. I just start doing it but the thing I'm doing is different. For a talk I'm standing up and speaking in the visual of secondary, for a screen caste the visual is much more prominent, much more important. And I actually start with the visual work been done first and then figure out what to say.

4:35 **Mike:** I have to ask, do you do the art through your presentations or?

**Gary:** The designs, the slide design, yep I do all that myself. I’m not a good designer at least I don't think I am but know how to get a color scheme on the internet. I know how to make things either line up or not to line up in conspicuous ways. And those are sort of like the core things.


4:58 **Mike:** Well maybe it's the simplest and just having a clean that gives in the sense of the design, you know that's.

**Gary:** Yeah I mean preparing talks has been the mechanism by which I've become much better at design. And the main thing I've had to learn is that it's very simple, like I have a lot of slides where it will be. I did a lightening talk today where I showed some things about how I design slides and a slide might be 4 words right. But I don't just put 4 words in the middles of the screen with its black and white. The color choice matters, probably at least one of those words is going to be a different color for some reason a semantic reason. And they are not just going to be in a line, they're going to be in a line, they're going to be in some kind of you know. There's going to be some kind of special relationship, it keeps people interested in the content.

5:46 **Mike:** Did you look at it, well where the influence stance or is it just the (unclear).

**Gary:** The point at which I started doing it was when I read a blog post by Zack Holeman who's a (unclear). I forgot the name of the post but if you Google for Zack Holeman's blog and you have a link. And one of the big things he said we line things up or don't line things up and that is sort of the core of what I do. It's really simple. Big fonts, not a lot of stuff on a slide, line things up or don't line things up.

6:17 **Mike:** Okay, some civil like guide lines. With the destroyer all software you have taken. I remember when you came to Activa and key trust you were talking about, I think you were just at the point at launching, you know preparing to launch, where you had just a few.

**Gary:** That was last year summer, so I was a couple months in.

6:35 Mike: Yeah and you were open to suggestions and you did apply some of those and I thought that was very impressive that it wasn't a, I'm going to create this thing and I know it and I'm just going to push it out the way I see fit. You were open to feedback and a few years on watching the interactions you have. I just wonder is that something that's been a double edge sword with interacting with the community?

**Gary:** As far as this destroyer all software I would say no. I get a fair good of emails to the supported drives you know a few emails a day, not a huge amount but enough that I have to check it regularly. And I don't know that I've ever gotten a question that I thought was just a dumb question you know. I'll call a dumb question a dumb question if I really think it's dumb but no people are very deeply engaged and the questions they ask are usually it's very deep meaningful questions like the really understood what I was trying to say. That is not true in general on twitter, where people are going to, people may like context about me, they might have followed me because they saw me do some silly format of lightening talk and they like the context for my relationship in software and so that colors your perception of what a person either believes or is saying. So there are very different role. So the destroyer all software subscribers have a lot of context for what I think about programming and they very rarely miss a tribute idea to me, or misunderstand what I'm saying. 


8:10 **Mike:** But on twitter different story?

**Gary:** On twitter different story, yeah on twitter it's much more frustrating for me because people will explain very basic computer science talk about concepts to me for example. I'm like I know you know and I know that already, I don't need that explained to me. And it's very frustrating when 20 people explain to you what like some basic data structure is or something. At least for me I'm very frustrated by that, I feel sort of attacked. It feels like people are saying, calling me stupid, even though I know that is happening, the emotional response I get is sort of defensive like I'm been attacked.

8:**48 Mike:** Yeah so it's because it's, I was kind of saying before we started the interview that it's a lossy, twitter I should I say is a very lossy medium that sometimes even the written word in long form is hard to convey a intense, that's why even I treat it at a joke back at you today and I'm like, I don't know how this is going to be received. You know I tried to coach it as much as I could and this is a joke. But some people are very literal and they see a question they're like oh, wow I'm surprised that he didn't know that. So but is it something that having becoming a success, success sometimes can be a double lot short in and that's really what I was going with but the destroyer all software is, you become more null and more, having more people been aware of you and it's the demi fame of my profession. It started to progress beyond just been one of the people in the crowd to been somebody that is a focal point. And that people start to you know kind of like with Uncle Bob, he's (unclear) people come to him you know for better or for worst, it's not sort of him, it's what people motivations are for going to that person. Are they going because that person is famous or because they've seen some kind of value from what that person had to say?

**Gary:** Right and that's an interesting dichotomy you raised because in the early days it's got to be from (unclear), it's got to be they are going to that person because they said something that they found useful but when you become properly famous and I wouldn't consider myself properly famous.

10:39 **Mike:** It's relative to other industry in the circles.

**Gary:** Right, but once you become well known enough people come to you because of your name or they might dislike, they might assume that you're wrong because I mean there are some people who are, who view the idea anyone who as no diarity as either doing it, extracting money from people by unfair means or detached from reality. There are a lot of people who think that some of the core (unclear) don't program, which is not true, those guys are all hackers, they're all hack all the time. So and I've had a little bit of that certainly not as much as you know people have been going on for a long time. But that is also, it is then very frustrating for me. And I'm actually; I'm planning on reducing my public visibility for exactly this reason. I don't want to turn into more of a comugon than I am naturally because I feel certain beaten down.

11:40** Mike**: Yeah and I wonder if that's I mean I don't have the opportunity to ask maybe someday I will but what happened with why, is that, overall most people have a very positive but I have to wonder what is actual interactions with the community really work and where people, was there enough negative coming at him that it, that also may draw (unclear).

**Gary:** I certainly know people in the review community, prominent people and more than one of them, who think that that is exactly what happened. If you go back to some of the post and read the comments I mean the posts are already self obtained right. Read the comments where he's interacting with people. He has a very sort of. He has a sort of sarcastic width that he's speaking at. I think that I mean, if I were Y watching me say this I'd be so mad at myself. But I think that to some extent he sort of might have been masking this content behind his very dry as I was speaking. So I don't know, I don't want to guess what was going on in Y's head. Poor guy probably just wants us to never say a thing again.

12:50 **Mike:** Yeah but it's warming to this conversation now, looking at somebody who's and this one thing is talking to many of the people here that are speakers and prolific speakers, who are authors or even freeing up a source site, a friend who creates a code in for job and sometimes people are just like do this, you know like he always (unclear). And that it’s the same thing for speakers and for authors. They assume that because you've created this thing, you're somehow obligated and I mean there is a social contract but some people take it too far.


**Gary:** Yeah so we lead us back to my destroyer all software interactions versus just public twitter interactions, it is very rear for a destroyer all software subscriber to demand anything from, there are a couple things that people seem to want, like and ITunes feed which I will do someday but as far as for demanding need, demanding for me and do anything for them, it's very rear. On public twitter people tweet like, tweet me a link t o just 200 lines of coding including specks and be like what's wrong with this, why is this good or not. I can't read and deeply analyze a hundred lines of code at a whim you know it will take me half an hour and I'm not going to take the time to do that. So it puts you in a very unfortunate position of having to tell someone, no I'm not going to help you with that and they may not realize that the level of demand that's on here, so as you can tell I have lots of feelings bound up in this.


14:**28 Mike:** But you just brought something to mind, a few years ago there was it's not so much anymore but there was a very very very popular pre SP (unclear) website called four guys from around and one of the guys on there he would get so many questions that finally he would just respond with a link to a page that explain how to hire him. So if you ask him a question he said, I have the website you can look at it, it has lots of answers on there but if you need some personal help my rate is $75 an hour and it's a minimum of an hour, yeah well this is years ago. But and it was also free answering questions, so we hear that he had this question and answering rate or even with FD (unclear) you can hire him, how to hire FD you know. So maybe that might be a way to turn these random questions to a few extra bucks.


**Gary:** Yeah I mean there is always that. I don't think I've ever responded to one of these or question that way and that's partly because I don't want to seem like the jerk. There are many kinds of jerk and I don't ever want to seem like the kind of jerk who is trying to take money from you but.

15:41 **Mike:** I will say I was aware of this guys contact when he did this. He was getting thousands of advice with the alternate now it's pushed back.

**Gary:** And if I were getting that many maybe I probably would just stop using Twitter and change my email address honestly but I lost my fan flow. So the other thing is I don't want to be doing that. I don't want to spend my day answering the same questions I've answered before. I don't want to analyze code for the same mistakes that I found before right. I want to be figuring out how to new things or genuinely interesting to me. It's not that I think that doing those other things is bad. It's just that I get bored very quickly and I don't want to be doing repetitive work. So unfortunately that's not a solution for me I don't think.

16:29 **Mike:** No that's fine and just curious; you had said that you had run a user group before; you had run a python group in Cleveland.

**Gary:** I didn't start it I just ran it for about a year.

16:38 **Mike:** Okay have you done much speaking or engagement with user groups?

**Gary:** Not really actually, I mean I did a few talks there; first talks I ever did were there long before I ever did a conference talk. I have done a couple in Seattle, mostly short ones. I don't think I've ever done a full length talk at a user group after I started speaking at conferences for the first time which was 2008. So it kind of just switched completely over.

17:**05 Mike:** As we're having a brief conversation and you alluded to having an opinion and I'm not exactly sure how to couch the questions. So I'll just bluntly come and say, what was your thought that you were thinking of?

**Gary**: Well, so my opinion about user groups is not why I stopped speaking out. So there is two pieces to this. One is that doing a talk like the one I did here is extremely expensive in time for me. It's probably, now a day it may be 20 to 30 hours of prep. When I started doing high quality talks like this it was more like 40  60 hours of prep, it was a lot of work. And I didn't want to be doing that to give it to an audience of 20 people because it's just. I mean doing a talk in SC and A as monetary value, that's how I make my living indirectly through destroyer all software. And unfortunately that is an aspect. I'm also just you know you don't want to do a ton of work to reach a very small audience, you want to reach as big an audience as you can. The other side is that I've been to a lot of user groups. I ran a user group for a year and I think that they're isolated nature as some negative effects. Most notably you can get into this weird situation where the user group forms a thought bubble in of itself where certain ideas become prominent and they're reinforced through people talking to each other in casual conversation at the user group and through presentation of these ideas. I think this happens to a small extent in the Ruby community when, the Cleveland Ruby community in particular, a very small group of which I was early and frequent member. We got into certain ideas that in retrospect I think that we weren't validating them against the outside world. We just sort of got excited about them internally and they were the right thing and we didn't really think enough.


18:58 **Mike:** So the way you described it, it was the insular bubble of a not enough cross foundation because that's interesting that some of the conversations I've had over the last couple of days have focused on the idea of getting beyond your small group. And it sounds like they were coming at the same problem that it was, you don't want to just become a, I can’t think of the word, but you don't want to just come a hive mind where everybody just agrees and nods at each other and says yes yes we're also smart. But it goes out to different group. So do you think maybe the answer to avoiding that insert group is spreading out and going to different groups and trying, go to the closure group, go to the .net group, go to something that you've not done before.

**Gary:** It could be, I mean I can't, my knowledge is limited to my own experience, so I can't, I don't want to speculate too much. I think that could probably help but there are always going to be things that are specific to a group like in 2000, when did we start that group? 2007 probably we started the  Ruby group in Cleveland and in 2007 in Cleveland you had the Ruby group, Python group and then a whole bunch of more traditional like Java, Sea shark kind of things. There was very little counter point to Ruby because Python is not a cultural counter point. It's a very different culture to Ruby but the things you talk about in Ruby have no analog usual in the Python community, so there's very little, there is no counter point to aspect. You know the counter point is X unit in Python basically. So that may be better now it depends on where you live etc etc. But I could certainly see (unclear)

20:51 **Mike:** What is it that Python has that the docu, the

**Gary:** Doc test.

20:54** Mike:** Doc test, I mean but it's just a, but that's one of the things I think would be healthy if Ruby (unclear) and hammered with speck one to a Python group and learn about Doc test and so (unclear).

**Gary:** That would be wonderful, every Ruby program we should learn about Doc test for sure.

21:11 **Mike**: Right and but it's just a different way of thinking and I think that's ultimately what I've kind of inferred from the conversations I've had over the last couple of days, is or less of our interviews is spent just cross pollination and it seems to fit in with what you described as becoming too much of a closed group, closed system and not getting to expose those new ideas, seeing oh that's really different than the way we do it.

**Gary**: It's certainly very valuable to do that, every opportunity, well maybe not every opportunity, there is a value to focusing down on something but it need to come up for sure.

**21:46 Mike:** Well thank you very much for taking the time to stop in appreciate it.

**Gary**: No problem.

In the closed world of the pre-Cloud era, traditional relational databases have gained tremendous leverage from tight coupling of B-tree storage, transaction managers, and query optimizers, providing developers with an efficient, consistent, and easy to use ACID programming model. In the open, distributed, asynchronous, and heterogeneous world of the Cloud, we must consider more loosely coupled computational models that are designed with distribution and concurrency in from the get go, and accept that our knowledge of the world is never fully consistent. Actors as envisioned by Carl Hewitt fit the bill perfectly. In this talk we will show how highly-available stateful Actors provide a flexible and easy to use programming model for the Cloud on the outside, while still allowing for the traditional programming models on the inside.

Those days are changing rapidly with new JVM features like invokedynamic and lambda, and with the rise of new frameworks like Truffle and Nashorn. In this talk we'll explore what it takes to optimize more exotic languages like JavaScript and Ruby and see how the JVM is evolving to do a better job. We'll see how projects like JRuby and Nashorn are trying to work around gaps in the JVM's optimizer. We'll see how JRuby+Truffle routes around the JVM to achieve blistering fast performance. And we'll look at upcoming projects on the JVM that will make language-building even easier.

Six years ago we started on a deep dive into Design Thinking inspired by collaborations with the Stanford d.school. We then extended those learnings, integrating Lean UX techniques, to help our clients focus the team's development power in a direction more closely aligned to a viable product market fit. Using two specific case studies and learnings from several other projects, I walk attendees through the weekly cadence that we use at Carbon Five during product development. This methodology and its activities establish a sustainable culture of integrated and invested teams that are able to communicate across disciplines in a meaningful way. The result of creating this type of culture via cadence allows our teams to put new features in front of users each week for validation and hence move the product closer to its market fit faster.

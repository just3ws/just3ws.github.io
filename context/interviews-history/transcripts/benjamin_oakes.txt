I'm here hi I'm Mike i'm here with Benjamin at the Windy City Royals conference in Chicago and Benjamin is involved with the new haven Ruby community and the Iowa City Ruby community you're right now you're in Iowa yep um can you tell me a little bit about what you're doing now and maybe also how it compared to what you were doing in Connecticut sure well I helped

start the Iowa City Ruby community uh about four years ago with some other great people and I moved to New Haven and I'm just now coming back so I got a lot of experience while I was in New Haven running a group there was one that kind of died off and you know we're bringing in some of those same experience we had they're like having a site and using meetup was which is

actually very very helpful for us versus just having a mailing list in like we've done a lot to get more jobs and stuff like listed on our site and have that be a place people I should go and talk and I don't know for the most part like we've gotten really consistent where we have a meet up every two weeks yeah and I'm really hoping to bring a lot of that same stuff over to the Iowa City group

because right now it's definitely a lot smaller yeah because a smaller area and like you know Connecticut it's right next to New York we have people come up for that all right I mean I was hideous closing up to Chicago that sometimes I maybe people would come on yourself but yeah maybe maybe not but yeah they're surprising all sorts of tourney yeah right right I mean it's not a train

right away yeah yeah yeah but um no for the most part like New Haven isn't incredibly technical I mean I was actually on the same level believe it or not really um but yeah it's really just kind of about you know you have these communities just to bring people together yeah and that makes a big difference just being around other people like at a conference like this

you know just being able to talk to somebody and so how have experience how long have you been running the group ads in Iowa again um I started about four years ago okay guy that's not Twitter okay but on but that was your in Iowa now but he were in Connecticut before so you've been running a group for about four years yeah some other great people one was

Denny he's at the University and then a guy by the name of West a berry he works out for roku right now he's taken on a lot of it and then I'm stepping back in and helping him out ok grown up so what I mean you were saying that the technical levels of the communities seem to be on par Oh mr. was there a major cultural shift between yeah Connecticut vs iowa city or yeah i mean iowa city's

a little more kind of like I mean there's definitely a personality difference there's really i mean people rubios all over I really kind of somewhere you really you know like which is nice because like they're mostly nice and you know there's kind of a stereo types of sometimes true that Connecticut or kinetic cutters or sometimes like I could get out of my way I'm driving yeah

ya know if you get if you sit down with people like they're all awesome yeah i always like talking to new rubios yeah yeah it's a ruby community for me has also been very very positive um but but as far as I'm getting people to come out to the meetings you know I've noticed between be in the suburbs in being the city an effort between just different cities and yeah leg and I study did not

use Twitter as much I've noticed yea which was a big thing for us so communication is heading and a little different ok you know it also as far as um not the technical skill but the industries of the people are coming out of we're working in I mean how is there a different like almost comparing like a Java group to a movie group there's got to be like are they working in the same

kind of industry a lot of people I don't like their startups maybe in committee yeah yeah there isn't just fine there were definitely some moisture out of sight I mean I still work for us right up in Connecticut they let me take my own I drive along with me which was really nice and I obviously there's more like education stuff like Pearson's there Pearson textbook company and stuff

like that and they have some Ruby involvement and yeah but yeah definitely more startups that I say in in Connecticut okay but the starting to change in Iowa which is exciting for me and that's thing I want to help build that yeah and I you do you do a bi-weekly meeting you said uh and New Haven we do okay in Iowa City it's right now every three weeks

which is a little confusing yeah yeah which is the beginning of the month of the end of the month ish yeah right and I saw a really close ties to everybody in New Haven and I really want us to like be able to collaborate where we've done some by or like we've gotten together for Google Hangouts before so we had a guy that wrote um design patterns in movies his name's escaping

me right now I know which book your job yeah so we he came and did a google hangout with us and the the Rubies I was City Ruby group and then the New Haven great man so we're trying to head we did a like a joint meeting glad I mean there's a few hours difference not just an hour yeah just know yeah yambo eastern time versus something fun yet so it's not even ours yeah I know and it

was cool so like we read the book and then we talked about it and the author was say I need took some questions and you know we won't keep doing stuff like that and collaborate because running every user group is hard nosed hard to keep up the momentum and if we can work together it's a little easier have you worked out has there been a difference in approaching sponsors I mean some

different communities I've heard have different levels of receptive receptiveness to sponsoring you you work with um so in New Haven there were there were some very vocal members that were against even having job postings which i think is a vital thing because if we're gonna have a ruby community we have to have people that can survive yang rubios yeah so that was a point of contention a

few times until we finally just made it official know you can have job posting you but really as far as sponsors I've ever gone I mean we've done O'Reilly books those are easy to get but um for the most part it's just like different companies they want to help build the local Ruby community and they I'll push it forward and that's why the group's around because it's really about

the members so that's great well thank you all for taking the time to talk with me Ben definitely it

hi i'm mike with you tastic i'm at chicago web conf today and i'm sitting down with melissa melissa is a professional interviewer unlike yours truly who is not as if you've watched any of the videos you would know that I am NOT a professional interviewer but I thank you for sitting down this is a little different work I kind of want to learn 10 minutes and I pick your brain a

little bit on camera so you sure your professional interviewer yes what does that mean it means I have a degree in broadcast journalism I went to Columbia College here in Chicago um and I kind of fell into it i started in gaming at horsing around TV came off show all about handicapping and i started their reporting for them teaching people how to handicap the horses by interviewing

jockeys trainers owners racegoers professional handicappers now were you into this gaming at all before my eyes that were to fall recognizable somebody did have a little bad okay yeah I thought it was perfect for me because all kind of like you know when I got into reporting I didn't want to work for the news I initially did and then when I went to school I was like God that was

terrible I gotta do something fun that would keep me interested and so when I started off and racing it was it was perfect unfortunately there's not a huge market for the horse racing in Illinois so the show only lasted two seasons so now I presume that you have to interview a lot of people aren't used to getting interviewed if you're engaging jockeys or people who are in the poker world

then might not they might be very intelligent people very articulate off camera but want to get on camera do they change a bit for you order well a lot of people in poker are just socially awkward in general they don't leave the house they play online and when they're in the casino they interact with only men which is the method of thing and they go a lot like a tech conference

yeah probably gonna thank you um don't try to fix that but it's it's Chuck yeah same reason poker um but yeah it's it's hard it can be like pulling teeth with some people but the best way is just what I do while camera guys setting up you know it just makes them feel comfortable talk to them joke with them you get someone laughing before an interview though they'll open

up a lot okays here so so basically that banter yeah for it's very important I I feel it's very important because I don't I'd like you and you said how you mentioned you don't structure an interview before you go into it you kind of feel where it's going that's that's how I that's my style to I I go in with the knowledge of my subject and the person I'm interviewing and then when I

get into it I I listen to what they say because a lot of times a lot of people don't listen and they jump to another question that they've had in their head that makes no sense yeah so which which I unfortunately i actually just done exactly what she said I was thinking about the next question then when he said there's they get all next question why can't people be explicit oh but what

surprised you can if they have it that you're not a me your gum people are going to do that I did that to it first I had a list of questions when i first got a poker I didn't know everybody you know and I didn't know anything in horse racing I knew how to bet the porches and I knew I was familiar with stuff from being at the track but I didn't know a certain Jackie or you know I had to look

them up and with poker especially I had to research his people in miller at how much is this person long what is he dying you know and I could ask them questions have you ever had somebody say like you don't know me like like they just assumed that they were so long on in their circles that you just know where they were I awkward woman I actually um the girl i worked with when

i first started someone kind of trade me and some players that I really didn't know that were you know big names because you know the big names from seeing it out of TV and things like that but there's a lot of you know people make a lot of living simple garden that you don't know and so she pointed out one guy it was an asian guy it was totally the

wrong guy she's like yeah that's been the master yeah knock him so I interviewed on when I he's got his name is like that's not me oh my god it was so awkward was probably so embarrassing oh my belt terrible and then I'm like oh my god I'm not racist she pointed you out Shelby that's where we were then she was on the side just like I'm so sorry the Coleman did you do suffer physio

joke a lot I couldn't imagine yeah enough but for was there anything about being a professional interview that when he came out of school year like oh it's going to be like this but then when he actually got out into the field it was not like that at all or was there anything that you major we've learned over the years of interviewing people of the same like me good she's my first

time well it's a lot more laid back I think because but I think when for broadcasting in school you learn a very new style of reporting and what from working i've only been working and gaming so maybe I just haven't experienced that but yeah I for me it's a very laid back what is what is I mean I can think to the kind of confrontational unfriendly interviews CN

news where it's more like trying to get somebody who's maybe not a willing interviewee to talk whereas you have somebody's probably more than happy to tell you all about how they just want yeah and I had um I've had people that don't want to talk that just lost the tournament or that I get people that don't don't want to do interviews you know they just busted but I just I don't

think and i'll ignore i'll be like that's fine I understand I won't force anyone to do an interview because it's never going to look up rude that's the thing i don't like the way that they do that when they you know charge people money in for just a clip you know you're not going to get anything from that and if you worse not going to get anything from that and you're going to look like

a jerk doing it so someone doesn't want to do it I I never try and push it okay well thank you very much for telling time no problem thank you so that was second

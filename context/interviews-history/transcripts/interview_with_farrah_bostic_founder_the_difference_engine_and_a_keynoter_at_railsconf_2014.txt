hi it's mine with you tastic i'm here at railsconf 2014 and i'm standing here with three of bostic who gave the end of the day keynote on our first day of conference offer thank you for taking the time to speak of me this is take two algenis ball fan ah so sure can you can you tell us about what the keynote was about the subject sure that the title of the talk was what happens to everyone

when everyone learns to code and I'm a beginner encoder myself both a few things I use rails as the framework for doing that but the thing that I was thinking a lot about is what happens when more people start to be kind of like me where we have a kind of conversational understanding of code and how does that impact how well can work together text and context deaf people

and non tech and dead people and really it kind of came down to a little bit of storytelling about my path into rails and into the community as well as some ideas that I've been thinking a lot about in terms of we we need non-technical people need the technical people to be part of the strategy of a product be part of it of the real high level decision making about the business

and user experience and and really what problem we're trying to solve and so that means we need to understand a little bit more of code and we're going to have conversations with our deaf partners and our dev partners need to have more through the investment and understanding of the decisions that have to be made at the business level out of the user experience level and I've you

you're not the first person in her dope that is a business person who came into rails what is it about then you come into program to three rails what was it about rails in particular that how did you even find out about it right it was it was a combination of things I had been a little bit familiar with PHP from a while back my career actually started out on a copywriter and advertising but

my the thing about being a copywriter and advertising it's not a lot of agencies need junior copywriters night so I went to work for a web design shot and so you had to kind of learn how to make things on the internet too small of a business story about specialists really so I knew a little bit about PHP hadn't done anything with it and I really

time and a friend of mine Noah buyer who found it percolate and he kind of reintroduced me to PHP and the kind of application based coding and so I played around a little bit with PHP i went to a startup weekend in New York and like october two thousand ten i was talking to lots of people about wanting to take that a little bit farther and learning to code and asking for advice on how to

do that and just about every developer i talked to a syrup weekend said rails was probably the most friendly framework for getting into coding at the application level because its bits pseudo code that runs right so it's close to play languages you're going to get that was that would be the taken 2010 at least and then that got layered on with picking up chris pine's book learning

program and that's Ruby based so then I started to get a little bit of an understanding of the underlying framework and then my boyfriend is Jared apples who's a rails guy so I sort of got waited on the poor health okay so there wasn't yes because I've heard recently that the rails is there's there's concern in the rest vanity that it's becoming much harder to get started

so I was curious as to when you said 2010 is wrong the time that you got started I just would like to go a little further and ask him you have you continued to use rails since then yeah yeah have it in flex and I sort of just started playing around that the playing around level and then I used rails to build from the ground up my own my own website for my business and I did that

at least will say twice Hitler was an actual like shipped versions of the site but of course it was more like 10,000 times it seems wrong but but both times for both major designs of it I did all myself I did it all in rails and so I just keep coming back to that site and now have a kind of comfort level with it I know where things are and so I can kind of drop back in any time when I'm

really curious has it has a heavy felt the changes in the ecosystem and they really wouldn't what's his coffeescript thing I thought I just he didn't know JavaScript right well so that was also protocol and talk yes days that I think about as far as I've got with the actual application side really is rails and so I don't understand anything about Java or coffee

or right here in the restaurant I drink coffee yeah but so the thing for me winds up being a heavy dependency on rails developers who translated my piece of script in another language into a gem that I can just go ahead oh and then every once in a while I have to ask for help when it really shouldn't be done that way and I'm more can't yet be done that way so I've noticed the changes and

notices copying script files and I've noticed those things but I'm still pretty intimidated by going too far under the hood so I live in model views and controllers and routes and I kind of said it's a mouthful at that and it's the most pleasant area do the pushing I have this for other people who might be looking at learning to code or or at least they have a product idea or so

they'd like to do is is the ecosystem so friendly to that is from your perspective I think so i think there's a couple of reasons why it still strikes me as incredibly friendly and one is that rail seems to be a sort of the default framework for most of the code schools and or at least the preferred framework so I've taken some classes through the Flatiron school in new york

and co academy and other kinds of things i still find it basically pretty intuitive as far as I'm even going to be intuitive for someone who's never cooked before and I think it's still a great place to relatively rapidly be able to make something that works and just as an example of that I was at a conference a couple of years ago where we were doing brainstorming sessions around business

people getting kind of creatively stuck and everyone had the same kind of pieces of advice about how to get unstuck and so we made little paper fortune tellers and I was like oh I can make face of a rail map that does the same I just a randomizer learn and so like three hours later we had a working merry BAE's a gap and rails were really friendly thing to do that in because you can tell really

quickly whether it worked and because someone else had already kind of worked out the basic mechanism month what's basically a magic 8-ball yeah yeah and s city is a developer myself it's fascinating to hear this what the year conversation this morning with ours which I yesterday morning ehh there's been so much I know if you've been following all on Twitter kerfuffle over

other not TBD is that alive and as I'm but what did he say you know this we better get in we obsess over these kind of details but the HH was talking about letting go of this astronaut stuff but that your people who are not necessarily developer background are able to come into these tools and do something productive and read and make money right and the pay the bills using these tools

um I mean does that strike you as kind of bizarre you hear us obsessing over like whether or not we should do things a certain way you're like I just took it I did it and it's worry there it is well not at all if I mean it my background being in marketing and market research we have the same obsession that's where we're obsessing about the best way to buy media we're obsessing about

programmatic are they saying about the most sciency ways of doing market research and having spent 15 years working in that those industries and kind of taking a step back and peeling back a lot of the trappings of that stuff and I think what what I find sort of encouraging is every industry in every community is arguing about things that matter to them whether they should

matter or not and that there is this kind of inevitable of heaven flow that seems to happen between obsessing about details or testing frameworks or making things really sciency or what really makes a coder versus not over and those those are the existential debates are necessary to these communities and then inevitably somebody has to be the one who sort of drops a bomb and says

actually those things don't matter or they don't patterns which we'd say they do so dhh is talk yesterday I was like jotting notes going well a lot of market research is also soon yes and it's the same kind of idea of test-driven development but in communications and that's something that I've kind of gone this beginner's mind thing works pretty well for me in building something rails

it works pretty well for me in the way I do the work I do now is a product strategist which is everything's a bit rough and ready and the point is we have to make decisions quickly things have to ship we don't have time to worry about you know the kind of metaphorical equivalent of four lines of test code that one line of working code and I really appreciate it

that whole lot sometimes it just has to be good enough I've I wouldn't have these interviews if it wasn't eventually just have to let go i'm doing ok but had a lot of people come into the interviews they see you know what if i make a steak or a stutter or you know what if i can't think of an answer and like I can't think questions & but you know it's all just y'all just mmm it was hard you're

making something they've actually well that's anything I really responded to with with his talk yesterday morning was this idea of you know the engineer metaphor and the science metaphor and all those things weren't comfortable for him and that the truth is that coders are software writers and because I'd started out as a writer as well and still do right writing practices writing

practice whether you're writing a new gem or a new project or you're writing article or an essay or short story you have to sit down and write and kind of the first thing you have to do is put ink on the page and whatever or not that looks like because the worst thing is a blank page right it was relevant for you right now it's before you get the record but yeah because oh my god what's going

to happen or likewise when I hit girls new and I'm trying to think about what I should name the project yes exactly sure I believe it yeah yeah it's talk about obsessing over the wrong things right and then you kind of forget the flexibility of the opportunity to edit like I don't have to know what every field in my database is going to be the second one when I raised scaffold but at

a certain point just sort of i can add things to it it's not general yeah exactly and so I really reacted to that is like yes that I think is what I like about learning this this this language of this framework is that it's a new way to think and write okay well thank you very much thank you don't speak user user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in

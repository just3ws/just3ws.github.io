hi I'm Mike I'm sitting here with Paul Baker who helps run the Chicago Chicago open government he's a you're you're sitting here in the web attacks office you're president or see CEO CIN a designer okay so can you tell me a little bit about what some open government Chicago does what is open government well it's been around since about April 2009 and it originally was

founded to promote the idea of opening up government data especially City Chicago data and using that data to create applications so we had designers and developers and people are just civically interested in good government that type of thing and like much open of open data it started with political transparency goes all the way back to Montana lies in 1919 and the Watergate

scandal in 1972 people have always wanted to know who's who's buying the politicos paying money to political candidates to try to get what they want and now it's gotten beyond much much beyond that people using data to make cities more efficient to you know if you do transit tracker you can write bustracker you can tell when your bus is coming oh this guy's yeah so there's

sources general day-to-day usages and also insight and how the government is operating and spending our money yeah there's lots of areas there's there's a government efficiency there's transparency the city Chicago it now is harvesting Twitter feeds and putting it into a gigantic data warehouse and then looking for mentions of things related to city services everyone one the type

of thing so there's tremendous no proof why would they do that why would they be gathering those that data from Twitter well because people tend to tweet there was an instance recently where people are tweeting about an accident and the CTA red line like 10 to 15 minutes before the CTA people even knew oh really kind of like that out when that airplane went down in the river hood but

you can also learn about which neighborhoods are their neighborhoods that are tweeting and have complaints about services but they're not filing through annoying calls oh you can you can figure out which parts of the city people maybe are suspicious that their calls are not going to answer so you're not calling you can do PR campaigns it's kind of like the people

when we might complain to our neighbor but we don't actually make a formal complaint and this we're doing in a public forum so the government can say oh okay so that's actually maybe one way whether they're listening but it's good so but what what do you do at the open government meetings to expose that we've got a wide variety of things up until Rahm Emanuel took office the daily

administration collected a tremendous amount of data but they didn't release any of it basically and when Emanuele came in he started releasing data and they've had a pretty aggressive data release campaign as lobbyists data crime data restaurant inspections a whole bunch of stuff so that we up until about March of last year april of last year when they started releasing data we were

largely lobbying not formally lobbying but trying to convince daily administration to to release data and we were talking among ourselves we sponsor we had a few conferences that we were part of there was an informal group of people including three or four the people who founded the open government chicago group who had been working since about 2008 to try to get civic data from

the city and we finally got it well we've been asking for it for all these years and now they gave it to us we have to do something right so with some of our first activities was actually bringing guys like chicago CTO john tova and packing the people to start developing relationships with people in the city Brett goldstein who was the chief data officer so we have a friendly

working relationships they can learn from us we can learn from them and that was very successful one of the first applications that was done there a whole bunch of my one that created splash was Chicago lobbyists data right Chicago lobbyists org and we work with the city we didn't get all the data we needed we did the website at Google hackathon and then we

listed on the website what other data we needed how we needed to change within 3-4 weeks we bet with the city with Goldstein and his deaf and they actually provided the data we wanted so we we we sponsored meetings with government people with data activists after after guys and gals started creating websites we would they would come up and demo the websites are doing we we helped they've

been a couple of been hackathons that we supported there have been contest that we've supported MSIC at a contest once mCRC that's metro a Chicago Information Center they're not around anymore unfortunately but they sponsored some contests in connection with the city type of thing so we've had a wide variety of speakers we've had Code for America people have spoken a couple

times a couple of month ago we had a presentation on the new open 311 system allows you to access data from 311 and also electronically submit data so theoretically it's not quite there yet you should be able to take a picture of a pothole and make a comment and then be geocoded automatically you can submit their electronically to the to the city city then you can get a code back that

you can track the progress of that managing that hole or whatever so and and I mean so it sounds like a few it hasn't been just a passive group of learning it's mad you've been creating stuff like can I want to just go back also to that Chicago lobbyist on that was created through the google hackathon now i remember when that was launched it was a very very interesting thing you

know III know that was a very interesting useful project well it has ribbon anything that you've worked on through the through the open government group that's been like wow I never would have liked his urban any like maybe preconceptions you've had about the government data that you came in and started and then as you're working through

the group had your eyes opened yeah in terms of the nature of the data itself the lobbying data is is a good example when we started we got 14 disparate files of a couple years worth of data excited then it's just one year's worth of data and you expect that there's all these lobbyists from big companies you know it's a three three three and a half billion dollar budget they're spending

you know five million dollars or 12 million valleys to ride the horse you know yeah well when Yeshua said look of the data a lot of the quote lobbying is nonprofit groups that are delegate city agencies they run homeless shelters but they have to have a meeting with three committees and they want I really want to change a building to expand it to house more almost people that everything

there certainly are the walmarts and the big companies who hire the high-end lobbyists to influence public opinion and to get legislators to do what they want but it's much less than we expected oh really yeah that was one of the big surprises is a lot of the lobbying is for totally it's a things a lot of building permits and that type of thing that are very routine okay so if you

know I wanted to build a hospital I would hire some people to lobby for me not necessarily I'm cigarette many for tobacco man you were there there's a chair right there there there yeah okay so that isn't just a rumor there is a lot of money Swanson walmart is you know all right had this big campaign to to finally build a story in Chicago and so they hired a bunch of obviously they

convinced the city they we have this data we haven't been added to the Chicago lobbyist yet but they also gave tremendous financial support to the sympathetic all different so he can win the election in award so that they can put their walmart in that ward so when we can tell the full story of some of these things yeah religious well yeah well it's they say follow the money in

this boat let it work you did say before well how long has been open government's been giving together in meeting I know you said there were some guys out on april two thousand nine okay and we met pretty frequently once a month which every couple months and tell about really until right before the beginning of 2011 and then things kind of slowed down partly because we're

just waiting for data and right only wait for data for so long and then when we started actually getting some data did we started having monthly meetings expect we had a mere web it takes for a while we can only hows about 33 people you got so big we got up to 60 70 80 90 hundred people we had them in other venues now most of Mirth the community trusts bit weird an analyst is one of

the founders of it and it's not a technology to specific you're more about the data and how we can manipulate it you don't really care about whether using Python or not well that typically people use Python Ruby on Rails few use debt net PHP where we're generally in favor certainly of open data and using non proprietary programming tools and systems but we have the ironclad rules

and we also encourage people to post the code on github and things like that so other people can use it right okay so you mean what about once a month and it's kind of got to watch the meetup site to read it varies a little bit we were we're very consistent for quite a while we haven't been real consistent about the day in the last few months okay well thank you very much for taking

the time to speak with me okay no problem

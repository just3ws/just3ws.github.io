hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at groupon today I'm sitting with Brian great who is the longtime leader of the chippy group here in Chicago should be is Chicago Python over a decade of leading that group but he's starting a new venture or new user group called shyam well first off thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me and what is chia chia chia chia chia chia is

the Chicago applied cognitive analytics group Chicago applied cognitive analytics cognitive analytics cream okay that big name yeah so let's actually think cept i could say what is cognitive analytics well cognitive analytics is the practice of applying your brain like thinking in the computer world ok so we're machine that it is AI so it's like when machines learn from other data they

apply that and the way human brain would it's um okay you ever see no IBM Watson with one jeopardy I know I mean I haven't I didn't actually watch yeah so that's that's a good example is she learning and cognitive analytics okay and cognitive analytics is a term that's actually trademarked by Deloitte where I'm a senior manager okay so I so you can say I you have my permission okay

great I so but funny more thing about the Watson they had to take out I heard three somebody that they had to take out the dictionary the urban dictionary because it weren't how to swear well that's not somebody not thinking like humans is the best thing then okay so you're you're you're very interested in invested in this cognitive analytics group how what prompted you to create a

community around so the community is prompted from looking at the whole ecosystem of other communities and I noticed that they're very focused towards one aspect of cognitive analytics well the weather it be machine learning or big data or just the actual science that goes behind some of the architecture the differentiator here is the applied park and we're looking at

applying this to world real scientific world problems and the people that we want to come speak they are addressing they're putting cognitive analytics in a place where it's solving real problems and we're talking about the whole stack the whole application of that system in order to make it more efficient or smarter or responsive or she user-friendly

optimizing things it could be a number of solutions there's a lot of low-hanging fruit out there for enterprises to add some cognition to their systems where is it also maybe just trying to break that bubble of I'm focus focus on one vertical our community is data science and maybe we've fixated on vertica or and for mix or something like that are you trying to

say let's break that bubble and think about applying these these tools to solutions yeah so I mean an example would be natural English processing as a classic example where cognitive analytics often interacts with something so some of these written something spoken whatever it may be taking that understanding what did they mean coming back with a response you don't have that

you know that's all based off of all the architecture the big data it has to do with the understanding the language has to applying it that whole that whole system that's what we're really focused on some of that problem and there's even competitions in this area like cattle we're inviting a lot of capital user for inviting IBM Watson speakers cattle is a competition that does a lot of machine

learning analytics sense that there's no surprises for you can join idea and you can join my team with me I'm doing one and i right just clap I would be so hello if you need interviews done with your team I could do that but uh oh so on but some so you're working with a bunch of different local organizations and in regional organizations to to feed in content I mean yeah so I haven't we

haven't really figured that out yet you know we're looking at reached out to a lot of people who want to help and organize it besides myself it's a big undertaking it's a complicated topic it's not for everyone i mean a lot of people don't want to sit there and talk about cognitive let excelled my wine but certainly the university's graduate students there that are working on that

in this area are very excited about it businesses like you know the firms like deployed or invested in and heavily and even users that are hobbyists that want to patch the machine learning to you know to do tasks around their house or whatever it is and i'm trying our solve these problems and the competition it reaches beyond academia we just beyond the firm world and its really reaches on

that you know the next world that we're living in it so it's really kind of its reheat at that time there's a large interest in it and it sounds like you're part of a certain trend i'm sort of see in a lot of user groups moving away from this screwdriver is the best screwdriver and i love this creature let's talk about the screwdriver every month to i want to build a house let's let's talk

about architecture and what tools do we use what do we use concrete you know what how can we build a house um so that brings me segways means you you were running the Python curb forward decade and then that you know it's a very very fancy screwdriver but were you getting a little bit tired of talking about this creature you want to talk about what you can build the sugar I'm not tired I'm

not tired of talking about cookies alive and well and I'm still we since we spoke last which was a while ago two years two years plus we have an organization team now we have someone goes operational just Treasury and everything like that so I have some of the burden of a monthly meeting lifted off of me for that and I do focus on finding venues and finding great speakers still so i

freed up a little bit of time so I had that available to me pythons a great segue and machine learning tons of the tools are open source in that world as well I can't get through a conversation easily talking with anyone in analytics today that doesn't bring up Python right it's really everywhere so it's a good segue this group's a lot more ambitious for me so it is my team or support

either than this should be kind of you know has such a strong community such a such a long community I don't wanna say it runs itself but certainly we have a lot of depth to reach from we have a lot of relationships a lot of depth level online yeah well a decade-plus them it's a lot of wow a lot of hands that I mean in what is written well thank you very

much for taking thank you we appreciate it does cheer and it's on meetup it's on meetup com our first meeting is going it's going to be attended Lee I think will be scheduled the first wednesday of every month so july second is our first meeting that's our launch off we're still looking or she'll getting organized with that you know it's going to be our best meeting to date matter

first yes but you know reach out let people know about gia I think it's going to be really a useful user group I hope it runs longer than after ten years I retiring from chia house okay he never be the one time yeah okay what we'll see in 10 years yeah alright thanks extra user groups with gloves to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating

conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today at your casa calm you

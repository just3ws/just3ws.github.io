hi i'm mike with you tastic I'm sitting here with Corey Haines Corey does the global day of code retreats and he's also very active in just speaking and being involved in user groups and technical education so Corey can you tell us a little bit about what is global day of code retreat what's a code retreat okay so critter traits at an event it's a community-focused sort of

directed practice event that is been going on for almost four years now there's all over the world and it's a day that's focused on practice rather than learning a new technology so you just write code on honey problems so there's a set format for we work on conway's game of life okay we work in 45 minutes sessions and at the end of the 45 minutes we delete all of the code we

did swap cares start again and we do it about five or six times through the day you know and then each session we introduce different constraints different ideas around object oriented design test driven development pairing things like that and so it's a day of sort of pushing yourself past where you normally code yeah and I like to say that it's we we take normal sort of

clean code constraints and different design ideas and we crank them up to 11 yeah I've been to raw one or maybe two of your events of things like no return values or don't use conditional statements is always interested but for the audience what what languages are you this is like a ruby specific thing it's it's language agnostic cooking so as long we asked people to come with a

development environment setup what we call sort of your language of convenience okay but the community events are very much if you're interested in trying it in a different language say you've never done closure and somebody there has a cloture environment setup then they can you compare within 45 minutes to get a feel for it a little girl I have we started

off a lot of Java there's a lot of C sharp that shows up a lot of Ruby that shows up but they're intended to be language agnostic so what do people do when I can't finish the problem in the 45 minutes i like you so very few people can and in fact it's intentionally chosen so that you can't finish the poem the goal is to sort of retreat from the normal pressures of finishing yeah we

all we all know that we write our worst code when we have when we're registering under constraints and under a time pressure and the corners we cut things like that so the day is built to allow you sort of that freedom to experiment and try new things so the very first one it's frustrating for people and by the end of the day it's frustrating not finishing it but you're kind of left and

here's why jumping on it and instead sort of that pressure to finish goes away start to focus on clean code focus on investigating different design ideas rather than rushing right and they actually have you ever had anybody like just be like kind of idea more like you don't put up above and just bring it out so I'm just doing we've had like for the first session a

lot of times people will sort of hack out a solution because they're still in that mindset of wanting to get it done but you know like a lot of us say it's easy to get something working when you're right crap right and so the idea of the day is to sort of write the best code you've ever read write and see what that looks like and take what you consider great food take it to the

extreme and you know we always talked about going too far but very few people actually get close to too far so so Shapley shoot for gold plating and what happens if you actually go too far what happens if you refactor too much or you extract too many methods what does it look like and by taking yourself to that place you get a better sense for when you are actually building a production

system how far you can go yeah and I think that that exercise of like sometimes when you want to start with we factor in your you're looking and saying okay I'm going to refactor this code and then you realize you did go too far we spent half a day and now you have to back out but this whole retreat you can see like what if I did this thing I want to try to do and it doesn't matter if

you want too far has united to back the truck you just pulled away you throw it away and that gives you a good perspective so that when you are working and you're like am I going too far you'll have an experience of actually doing it so that you can be like well no if I go a little farther it's still okay and what was probably it was probably the most unique

experience you've had like do you have like a specific because we're going to get into the global action but the actual edit code retreat a solution that's a madea design we have done something like implemented it in demo script or anything like that we've had people fool around and bash scripts I think one team did triumph in script and it's always interesting every code

retreat there's always some sort of interesting approach to it so there's nothing really that stands out like that was the coolest I did see at a quarter tree in Colorado where I think I'm a final session so people ended up writing a fairly reasonable solution in about six or seven lines of rupee Wow and I was like oh well what if you need to do this I change this and they it was

actually a really nice small scripted solution we tend I tend to encourage people to over engineer so make a ton of classes keep very small methods things like that to see what it means we drop that term over all the time but few people know if you people could recognize it and understand why that's a problem now about the global now I mean I know you started

doing these these club treats as kind of a one-off thing did him in a few places but you do one spends the entire globe in one day yeah so last year in 2011 in August I put out a blog post and said wouldn't it be cool if we have 20 cities around the world all on the same day and we could skype and stuff yeah and it sort of took off and by the i think it was december fifth of 2011 we have 94

cities 14 time zones all doing it around the world on the same day and you tried to help grown so I did Sydney which was one of the first ones and then I caught a 6 p.m. flight that landed in honolulu at six-forty-five am the same day so while the Sun was going this way you were right hot there was another way I went the other way and so I'm going to try to do it again this year ok we're

aiming for 200 cities this year we are already at 60 which is about on track and so we've got two months to go and that's usually when it starts picking up and yeah it's a really great day there's a lot of it sort of brings the community the global community because coger treats justice as one off things are done all over the world pretty much every weekend now there's at least one

or two going on a wall a couple weeks ago there were six of them on a day and global day is really about ringing it's a there's two really cool parts about it one is bringing that global community together all around one event and then the other aspect is introducing and training new facilitators because during the day the facilitators role is to introduce new constraints is to answer

questions help people out ask questions and so it's we do trainings we do facilitator training young home cocktails I mean if somebody wanted to become a facilitator and it's like man this is really cool i wish i could do this in my city or in anchorage yeah there's already around you know how do how do they go on doing so all participants from mia well the it's

built the formula is very well-defined and so it's sort of built so that even if you are a horrible facilitator right if you stick to this format then it's going to be a great game so it's intentionally made for people to be able to just do it and follow a script almost and then for as you do more and more you get more understanding of sort of the subtleties of facilitation how to

introduce the exercises things like that but if people want to do it I've had lots of people email me with those exact same questions and I've never done this I don't I don't feel like I'm a great developer all about it's like the best way is just to do it yeah the this isn't a great developer exercise it is the path it's a path and you know I like to tell everyone that

every facilitator that's out there there's a handful of us who are experienced facilitators and have done a lot but all of us had our first one you know and i know very specific people who are very active in the community do a lot of these things and i remember their first footage when they emailed me i talked to it and you know how to skype call with them and walk them through

some ideas and now they're doing them all the time and I mean with it getting so big I just wonder also is against our place is it getting to become point where there's a coder tree being set up and you didn't even know about it no absolutely yeah absolutely I that's cool I'm very strict about the format and so we have it published this is the format I've been sort of iron hand holding the

or mad that if you want to do a code retreat this is the format if you call it a code you want to call it a poetry I always make sure to tell people that the it's not intended to be the only activity that anyone ever does and it's not them it doesn't cover all aspects of development it has very focused things that it works on and it's there's lots of really important practice oriented

activities people can do but coder tree is this and so I've been fairly iron handed about that and but now it's sort of as I've sort of curated it and then gone it's it's intended to be decentralized okay so people set him up and do them you know all the time very few people now like email me and go kanna right because it's not about my approval or my

influence or anything like that it's a local event to bring people together and so it's kind of finally wrong beyond your yeah that's ask me really cool feeling it's a wonderful feeling early on I knew sort of what everything was doing and you know I I pissed a couple people off because they're like oh I'm going to do this I'm like well that's not a code or treat I'd ask you to not

call it a coder tree yeah but now it's gotten it's it's sort of reached that level where it's beyond yeah it's not centered around me I'm sort of a one of my one of the guys called me up and out but Neville and dictate around I think more instigator yes and I like to cure yeah like I run the code retreat dot org site but it's not like I'm on there saying what can happen and there's

enough people now who are experienced facilitators experience hosts who just they're off doing it and there's not really experimentation around the format but there's more and more experimentation around exercises during the 45 minutes I was just going to that be relevant so when I was just thinking about is well if its object oriented functional

programming is very much becoming not popular now could somebody do a functional kochi would not still be a coder cheater absolutely absolutely the the format is the 45 minutes the throwing the code away economies game of life my i'm an 00 guy and I've been doing a lot of sort of thinking about Oh concepts over the last couple years and so the code retreats that I facilitate

and the exercises that I do focus on sort of the edges of understanding or mo design I don't have a tremendous amount of like expertise in functional paradigms I did I've done you know a fair share of other some remember like a theme that they wanted to build a code retreat around and they they can make a cohesive set of exercises to do with in a format they could absolutely so a

perfect example of that is JV reigns burger started a thing called legacy code retreat okay and it was the first sort of expanding the family of poetry and so they don't do counters game of life they have a code base that Chef Hendrickson and Patrick Welsh put together which is a horrible code base and so the takes rooms known as room or exactly well it's checked and so the

exercises are about writing tests around at refactoring and it's still it's a legacy code retreat so the classic code retreat I'm very you know here's the format there's no reason you can't come up with something like a consumed at hauser came up with a test automation voter tree okay so they we have been experimenting with doing the coder treat format but around

different techniques in test automation okay so they use a code base and work on different automation tools with how can we hit this this we are going to dealt with yeah and so what I what I'm aiming for and what I love to see is an expansion of the coder treat family looking rather than a if you go to something called poetry you don't know what you're going to get because people

are doing whatever they want but if you go to a legacy coder tree you know you know you get this if you go to a test automation code retreat Brian lyric for a little while is talking about putting together some exercises on a refactoring poder tuned and so I love this how can you meet any movies yeah and so but I tell people I give people asking like can I use a different problem all of

this and I generally say no well I always say no but what I want people to do is use you know it's been we've been building and sort of fine-tuning the format for almost four years now it's settled it's good yeah early know this will just worked we early on we did a lot of experimenting around the format and settled on something that works and so what i want what i would love people

to do is come up with a different set of exercises centered around something specific and then call that a xcover chief love to see somebody who has more experience with functional language is and knows about functional design come up with a set of exercises that are really applicable to functional program and have a sort of a functional code or treat so for example one of the

exercises that I love doing that always causes people problems is no return values my favorite and in a functional language say you're doing it in clojure well Clojure has got a lot of just data transforms right in what comes out as its transformed into some other format and so the core a lot of the core is built on data coming in data class o asking him to say no return value yeah I

don't know like I'm not a cloture guy I fooled around a little bit paired with people but I don't know if that would give them a valuable thing to practice right I know but Melissa would make them try to think of all the something like if they're always saying it goes this way it goes this way who's this right what if it goes like this what if it goes like that I know that in 00 the

exercise around no functional or no return values is fantastic and it's a really valuable design style that you can use and get better up and in certain cases it's a much it's a highly it's a much more superior form in certain cases and so one of the ideas is that we tend to have the way we code right it's sort of like our stuff the wagon train where you code this way for so long you end up

with Rupp's that your wheels go down and it's effective and you get to California and we're behind your goal but what if if that's your only tool that you could pull out then you know what if a problem what happens when the elder wagon wheel falls on yeah yeah and so on trail really yeah or what if what happens if you get dysentery right exactly what I have a problem yeah so

yeah that's really the goal of it and global day is about increasing the number of people who are comfortable facilitating expanding it after last year last year the majority of the people running them more new new facilitators new hosts and that led to an explosion this year of people who had a little bit of experience doing it so that's where we got every weekend yo to

the event you go to the cutter trade or excite so it's come that's always going to to wrap up and say for people interested in participating we're running a coder treatment you have one code retrica or is our two dar social network is built on name and there's a big banner right now you can go there's a page for global day it's a global dave aude retreat org okay but if you go to

code retreat or go to banner eos so there's an events listing okay so it has both the registered locations for global day as well as what's going on this weekend in and it could be near your town okay great well thank you very much thanks so much for talking I keep up the good work these are great interviews thanks

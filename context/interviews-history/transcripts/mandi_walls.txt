hi it's Mike again with you tastic I'm sitting down today with Mandy walls who's a technical evangelist with Opscode the chef people if you've ever done any kind of building servers or managing using the chef's utility well it's Opscode hi Mandy thanks for taking the time to sit down with me today kind of just want to ask you to straight off what exactly is a technical evangelist

in and how do you work with the technical community do you run conferences or where you work with with people at conferences do you speak or how does that how does that work what is that so originally our technical evangelist positions were folks who basically help our customers and our would-be customers I think understand uh what chef does what it is how i can help

you manage all of your systems over time and as obstacle has grown we're actually now the obstacles professional services team so technically I'm really a consultant and I get to travel to our customers as they need help we do training I go to conferences representing Opscode so sometimes like in a booth or at a table passing out literature sometimes giving talks about

our product we run our own conference um so that was the other part of your question uh we are Opscode does run a user conference okay knowledge chef cough and that's actually this year taking place in April and so we put that together as a forum for our bigger customers who um well for anybody really but as a as a place for our folks to share things they've learned about chef

and how they're running their infrastructures and and things like that is like um very interesting yeah chef is is open source correct absolutely yeah so so it's it's it's an open source platform for managing servers and people who are managing what it's linux it's all linux if i actually uh we support windows now oh so yeah you can have

windows clients for different versions of windows 2000 server 2003 and 8 and Windows 7 and we also have support for like commercial unix is as well okay so the app I just point out on the name of the conference that you mentioned a chef golf shop calm so it's chef comp is it all opscode speakers or do you bring in other okay oh no it's all its if we have an open call for papers actually so

anyone who uses chef for whatever they do they can send us a submit to the RC F P and come and talk about what their we're doing maybe tools they've developed a round chef some folks at etsy in particular right a lot of tools to do what they do so they had a talk last year about some of their tools on some of our other larger customers that are doing sort of interesting things in

spaces where open source software is not generally found so like in financial services and things like that right um those folks talk last year we a talk from fidelity um we had cycle computing they do like bioinformatics sciency sort things um so yeah everybody does anything with Chef okay so do you are you involved in organizing or doing the reviews for proposals or yeah absolutely

i'm there's a number of folks at opscode involved a lot of us do the reviews and then there's a group of us that um work on you know planning the deciding what kind of other activities to have you know are there things we want to focus on as far as you know topics that the community is interested in that maybe we don't have nobody put in the CFP for so yeah we have a small committee of folks

that that I'm on that are that do the planning and then there's everybody who is interested really can read this the the papers and review them as they get submitted so we get an idea of what everybody thinks is interesting is we all talk to different customers so um knowing what the entire community is interested in learning about is hard for one person to keep track of yeah yeah

it's hard for one person to be the gatekeeper in it absolutely a couple of weeks ago we had a kind of an interesting conversation ash Dryden has been trying to gather people together who are interested in increasing diversity in the technical community through conferences and user groups and places like that and you were one of the people that I met on that call what what

what made you interested in participating in that conversation and how does that relate to what you're the work you're doing with with chef comp um so my interest in that it goes back a number of years um for one thing I've always worked in operations and when when we think about diversity in the technical community at large some areas some niches have better diversity than

others so a couple times I've been to two conferences related to maybe database technologies or programming languages and the diversity is a lot more broad there than it is when coming from operations so um it was when I started my career it was years before I actually met another woman systems administrator so um I kind of got an interested in that from that perspective

like it there there really isn't that much diversity in operations it's still very male-dominated which is fine you know it's just how things happen but there are women out there doing it and so well yeah operations is is it it's a unique place in that it it it has it may be male-dominated but it's not necessarily even perceived as being a positive it's always got that awful

stereotype of the beard hacker and the UNIX you know the neck you know the bearded UNIX old dude who just has been doing this stuff for a million years absolutely but even then it's it's it's more diverse I look at our ops team here at Groupon and there's males females young old but it's it is tends to be to be female I'm excuse me to be male yes so yeah so I just drew a

blank here and what my point was but you're saying about the the that it doesn't not be a very diverse group in yeah anyways it in its urban anything you've done that like trying to hire in more women or reaching out to like women's groups side you know there's some of these women who code black girls code things like that but is there anything like that for operations not

really any years ago um when I was first getting started so the Linux chicks were around did I actually picked my mind moniker before I even knew they existed oh um so I go bye-bye Linux chick but they are an organization that was sort of formed to font to help women learn Linux in particular um sisters is another group that is sort of a technology agnostic and that there's

women from all different portions of the technology spectrum there including academics which is a little interesting um is that wasters as in like sys yeah ok so like system sisters okay yeah yeah and that's supported by the Anita Borg Institute and that's been a really good group as well but as far as i know i don't i haven't come across any like um sort of the the groups like that are

coming up now like the women you code and girl develop it and things like that that are focused on operations and and part of that maybe is that it's it's hard to teach operations and and we as a portion of the the industry are struggling with that right now like how do we distill the things we know in a productive way to help the next generation of operations people and

maybe when we get some of that figured out like it's it's one thing you know you've got like thirty five forty years of pedagogy for you know teaching software development and and even though the methods have slightly changed the languages are a little bit different you're still building if you have notable building blocks and how you teach software engineering on the

operations side like what do you start with like okay here's how you log into a system but then you can go an infinite number of directions yeah and we haven't really put that together yet so there's some cool stuff like ops school and some other things coming up that I'm really watching to see if there's going to be something there that we could use in a similar vein as outreach as you know

education for the next generation putting something together that's a in a comfortable environment for for girls and women who are may be intimidated by technology or don't really know enough about it to even make a decision so yeah I'm very interested in following a lot of that stuff the girls who code stuff and in all those railsbridge pi ladies all those groups are really doing some

really great things yeah so you so to wrap up you mentioned that there was two groups that aren't directly related to ops but there's the Linux chicks people can check out and the sisters as in system that's why I sisters and you said those are focused on learning linux and the fundamentals of getting involved and starting there yeah the Linux chicks definitely our Linux Pacific sisters is

just basically for as long as you stay on technology topic in some way we there's good threads about you know interviewing and work-life balance and all kinds of stuff or technologists it's really good oh cool I will thank you for taking the time to sit down with me today absolutely thanks for inviting me

hi it's Mike again here it with you tastic at SEMA I'm sitting down with Karl Erickson who is a CEO of atomic object singular not plural and he's working on a project called bit camp where he's working with middle middle school girls so we actually they can become part of the tech community can you tell me a little bit more about what is exactly the camps here we did we

first time we didn't do campus in 2006 michael and we did it because we recognize there were very few women who are studying computer science and then therefore very few women in the field and software developers we wanted to try to do something about that but as a university professor before i started at I Mike I recognized that when you start thinking about that issue in freshman of

college year that's too late yeah so we wanted to go back earlier and we wanted to start getting girls excited and showing them what's possible what a life of being a programmer is like a work life being a programmer but when they're still young enough to not sort of have made up their mind that they can't do that or they're not interested that or that's boring or unexcited yeah it's and

that seems to be middle school they seem to get turned off somewhere around middle school yeah it's a I from from females of my family that I've spoken with they think that it'sit's kind of Boreas thing that is it's just sitting down and looking at a computer all day and it's so much more no collaboration rights where I solo sport me put your little headphones in and you go into

your little cubicle may throw food over there outcomes code that yeah enter our office environment so much the antithesis of that and our projects are so team oriented but honestly collaboration and communication are at least as important those skills as software development skills so I suspect if anything women might actually have advantage in that kind of environment so

with working with the young girls at is there a difference in the approach that you have working with with young females versus young males so we've never done anything we've never done anything with middle school kids my daughter at the time was 14 and so I had no I knew about 14 year old girls but we haven't done anything formerly teaching lies and I've never talked that kids that young so

what we didn't we decided that we wanted to try to give them a little bit of an overview and you know I was a professor so I had this perspective on some hands-on exercises some simulation some some doing practical things as well as some lecture and we put put big camp together out of one a one day experience with plenty of snacks and lunch and you know some fun in between we didn't

Taylor it one way or other gender wise and we tried to appeal to lots of different ways of learning and we may darn sure that they were paired up when they were working together so it's very collaborative so like what kind of exercises where they do I mean was there something that was more why x-ray without leading into any kind of topic book what kind of exercises were you

having the children to do well so we we really wanted we were focusing on the web and we really wanted them to have a basic understanding of what the web was and how it worked and so of course we're going to do some HTML and CSS and some lightweight JavaScript a little bit of back end stuff but i also wanted him to have an appreciation when they click you know the return key to send an HTTP GET

request like what happened there how did those packets flow across the bed and where do they go and what came back so we did this little simulation on the floor with the girls and chairs as packets and we push them around through the network and showed how that work how we do so making it real making a real of response was assembled we have a little you know HTTP response chopped up into

pieces of paper and then we handed them out and we reassembled at the back end and trying to get it to be a little more physical it's an interesting thing that we're and probably the first time in human history where a machine is completely true opaque oh yeah complexity is hidden behind that simple little keystroke yeah and I wanted to give an appreciation of that and so one

of the things so because we're looking at the idea of community and females at conferences you know usually our are isolated or or well I wouldn't say at least very much the minority right now it's or been any and sometimes they're met with a little bit of hostility a little bit of misogyny when they when women make make a complaint about that or make some kind of observation that

hey you know what's going on and try to figure that out has there been any negative reaction towards what you're doing trying to work with children Sydney why you work with girls why don't you know I have not heard that okay and I think we have a lot to be embarrassed about in our industry for this for this very reason okay but in this case I haven't heard any any sort of push back

now after we ran it in 2006 we had a steady trickle of people saying any when you gonna do it again I want my child go through it and some of those were girls and some there was a voice so I have requests for everybody okay there's definitely interest there we the last time we ran it was in a few months ago in Detroit in our new office there we partnered with the Detroit Public

Schools and Oakland University local university provided students most of them were women to help mentor in teach and the students who participated a DPS you know some of them didn't have a computer at home to register way to register phone some of them took a bus to get to our office it was a it was a really much different socioeconomic demographic than

the first time we ran in two thousand six right yeah and that kind of brings up the concept the digital divide you know that the accessibility to those was technology and did you was there any difference that you saw between children who had computers at home and their ability to learn and adapt to the technology or maybe something that you maybe had that help kids that might not

have been excused it seemed like all the all the girls even the ones dependent not the computers at home were exposed to libraries or school so now we did not notice a difference okay so yeah they knew what a mouse in a computer was absolutely okay well thank you very much for the work that you're doing it's really great and thanks for sitting down with me welcome enjoyed it

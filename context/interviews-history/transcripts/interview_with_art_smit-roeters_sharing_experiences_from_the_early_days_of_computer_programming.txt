you could put beer and then I didn't realize it at that time of your child you know what was best for my mom I don't know in pain there and in those days many people had gold jewelry and we were able to sell and go too early in those days or 24 karat gold so anyhow determine he's came in and of course my pleasant period because God is like the German team in Adams so then the last

two years hate enemies on a monitor and that's another amazing story she had a summations she she is a christian but she wants the wrong one my father was she went to his people yeah the wheelie would we had multiple lines of em and she started in there nothing else at Sonoma and and said oh yeah my father's alive somewhere else and bad to worse because when she sputtering and was

environment a little sister I'm so glad that he were incapable still kept United it is unusual so then anyhow two years before the war ended including Germany staff consultation can be trusted person albury let me see 45 2013 13 14 and then wars over and then we had to bhangra fina mediums the amount of the Hamptons independence that God so my end of the world war two they picked up on a man

who could find them including me amazon 15 is also be put in jail for two years yeah and of course you know you can start but then again no that's amazing thing in this until we had diamonds and I forget at the end card you look look very very influential very very rich and we had chinese creature and then one becomes possible deal that all three first I mean you agree to became a very

powerful put it turns off of witnessing in condelor boxes well so am and I know another amazing thing happened with this is how much 15 in the young money a thousand men should be long enough you prime minister mutilation stereogram okayed and so happy that there's some good man every time you go you know we go maybe the league or so piece of me didn't slip of me green so if you feel

did it I got more than that because this year yeah that's amazing trainee how then I went to the Netherlands were pitted lap time of course I was an army over there are given happy to thanked and then I start learning for shell 1916 will be here sponsored by the Dutchman tianjin resolute Vienna and an in want to be beyond forever I mean I mean it's all honest work ever jack of all trades

and told us were you know nothing judge people on live in the end the night forever so internet was in that works with lily and it's all a prank and started just cleaning up my spook if he got me l'application Aziz you know the amazing thing is true and that was hired fastest person and I'm not as smart as written and I said I mean however when everyone to look again and business to

be exactly economy whatever it takes I'll get it on all the time non-free in those days about the power statement in East Asia to have a card to get in the ship but anyhow so then Stannis time working girl more chemicals and then and it's time to get computer right he wont to have interface their blood allows this analysis reporting parameters what a local analyst and then

he said mounting me to do the computers and so that he knows aged when you park by to compute big blue and so he asked authorities announced officially under 200 and so then answered them got the HP has cage not one megabyte and then some healing which and later on was the same wood and later on ready to pop our computers start to write in basic bitches still I think basic is still a

my part of you still very very good programming language he can have anything you wanted so to speak and then now you go report on Portland too important for daily within happen because you know I could see how powerful applause so they're encouraging us to interface it wasn't mouse machine to the computer and all last year moment you about meeting conclusion of the

coming views and it the big blue people of dialogue so similar in school and first thing I learned is how to make the telepath provider off to the computer and active morning you had to put up the system was not the count put it to sleep good up and put it in her bus through paper tape musta gave pulls and defeated go to the spark appear and then he puts on some things on we couldn't punch

brothers not forget the code in and all that I mean was just very very crude and then add computer go swimming but now we had a computer to the teletype machine which was slow but in our we had to make a caliber machine talk back and forth to the computer and so so I wanted to prevent how to the engine and chip protocol but what builder called an obsession of it you just didn't and so

you know and in those days there was no quality control indeed he just did it but anyhow then now he could talk to the computer and computer that finally he could give commands and then what good is running out of time ok and then so then we made it if you talk to to cart brunch because yeah cartoon and so and then Holliday hit the command of the conference that supported victor because

thousands of miles across per day 14 / you know people whereas out and start sticking in his special tool to cook after old car and enter keeping his chickens because what we had to do the culture seekins and out of sequence of us probably was gone so we put it in boxes and then the box is percent too big blue people and then they actually sent by mail or courier occurred mom it

also we had 40 and the prof dr today and they all had stay in sequence OMG and someone had to carry them downtown so I'm dried up again nan and Ethel to put in in that port Wow yeah and so in order to get a date on the cars part of a girl should we have data and we had through own affairs it was punished but not later we went to two and the running fill in spaces sure

that matter what i did and i made tempest through that the lab technicians shove the guardian and is he located is it Lucas County and I am and ghosts and if you people could read the mornings he started to poke one and then of course in those days ago and then Danny started more power and more power and as finally was time to get to get online and so we got the big HP system still many

computers they still despised by the big global peace yeah and so then yeah I remember him he had this glass each other wish hi have you have your white skirt and you had the dispatch 6660 platters perfect and you were happy because not under 50 megabyte wow we are in business you know but the thing is in those days computing both much simple but I like those days most especially in

assemble that given complete control there are no subroutines you wrote your own are you copied from somebody yeah that's fine could we learn so you copy that and then maybe they need anyone that space avail he put something else something else in there and I later on we got basic because we had more space available and I'm an asylum oh my god that's page

because I also concerned about faith and in that later on who means business lab growing computer business and let me like i said it its own for me that's the Danny I got into for time and worked and for and that that was okay the business of getting data online are better getting adamant about now supporting people who have study stations of our programs with statisticians and they

gave me the algorithms and then they used that and the usual which is amazing there now he's low meaning computer people is trending of respect because we did some difficult analysis and ass not my work I mean it's the statisticians and one of my friends was that we had a very difficult relation- each of la moglie and again in those days he start using subroutines brick it all aside i

still have parted I think I'm or on Raw and Mark and a hint Ali Meredith aura because you had to use an orphan a very good at thinking time so anyhow what happened was then follow just one of the turning of the powerful footage and stations and for me but no and is big but they want to do and evil enemy worker SAS SAS institute assess institute adopted the room that the poem

I had written you know Assassin's introduces simply Christmas but then Dennis terrible documenting it proved by piling on what this line not point by point for 915 on I mean I was a big deal and of it really was and so they took a program and children that I off both a planet and then I started getting important data which I did not relational didn't watch many you know

you put strip data and what is it called for hugs the famous guys I really hate to break up the party but we need to get going okay what are you doing we're recording oh okay so yeah I'm so active talking Notre this is perfect building at anyhow and I said to get involved in big databases and getting data from a lap into the databases and then then documentation start to get series

marriage agency is because we apart of the FDA to approve final velocity is planning on business and then we also heard get some Japanese civilians they were even more steak is really wanted to know you know you could make changes but it has to be documented documented in documented and that finally we are able to put programs together if it became sent sunday anatomically downtown

passport I still think and also need but the data demo said that he made a PDF format because nobody could change it I think nowadays I think you can I don't know because he PDF because went to the FDA in Washington DC is tell us now for one sturdy we had to send the whole box documentation size room for the FDA to check it out so they spend alone electronically and he had to

convince and not benefit you get it improved bomb proof of the speak so and so that's basically it a so called love and like I said I'm I didn't I don't have a car CB but i really put it in time and I really wanted to know I really has a lot of questions so I commit a lot of play game isn't she doesn't this another thing memory him so I got a lot of friends and so our kid

and you can help can help it is competent so none of you can I realize that networking is so important in the good sense not not burning plain network if somebody needed to help the situation however what a foolish not a miniature cooking for this as we had grass along test and so we had to get or exponential curve norm of hurt whatever but sometimes I'll hard lies in that which

way up and if you pounded into the curb but school occurred in a bad way so what we had to do is continue to curve and at one point upon to one pointed to the peak it shows an indication that there was an iron marriages could explain later so do I got a lot involved in traffic lately getting the day before and i added a happy you enjoyed it yeah I skate oh cool well

thank you very much I hope I think it will be okay I think

hi I'm Michael I'm sitting here with a gin lender in Milan Dorota and they're working with the tribune company in Chicago and they're doing a little like a usergroup support network called tribune tech and you you're hosting some groups you tell you said you you've hosted j/s hack nights and you have a something planned for Chicago Ruby testing yep should I go testing group

scuze me so can you tell a little bit about what you guys are doing and what you're looking to do with the community into the microphone sure so tribute technology wants to get engaged in the community wants to help as much as possible so we know there's a lot of great ideas out there and a lot of people a lot of you know really cool user groups so if you're looking for

hosting or if we can help in any other way make sure you let us let us know Tribune tech that's our twitter username and we're also facebook and i think it's a facebook com / tribute technology yeah and yeah it's like we're really trying to help help the community and they'll pass because you know when people come to us we get engaged we we find get new ideas new technologies and that's and

that's good for a company good for community good for everybody yeah so I the the groups that you've hosted so far how did you you know come to you are you guys using a lot of JavaScript in Reubens generally so you want to figure out a way to like give back to the community by posting and bringing people in or yes it was a the Tribune itself was basically saying no to itself like

nobody really knows that we do technology yet they don't know how much we actually use and we they have open source some gems this year there there's a lot like under Ruby and some interesting JavaScript to and so they asked for volunteers to basically be like an interface to the community in general to basically help you know support whatever knowledge sharing and a

better development culture within technology and to sort of let everybody know what we're actually doing to support the things that are good so that's how we met and we all started this like volunteer thing and we knew various user groups and so we started reaching out to people that we knew in the committee saying like we'd really like to host we

would like to you know do other things we you know come along and that's how this ball got rolling okay and sorry I mean have you guys been the key metric is are you guys having fun and enjoying it as if this is something this isn't something coming from corbett this is something that you guys helped to create or I mean how did is its unique that a company would be saying hey how can we

figure out how to become more engage with the community especially when it's not yet no yes yes so I think that's a that's a that was a great idea because they basically came up to us they said okay we need volunteers that are going on you know you're gonna get certain number of hours that you can work on improving our culture you know connecting to the community and you know

just conference they didn't tell us what to do they just told us what we could do and are we didn't have any limits yeah so that's really cool like because everybody's a volunteer and we're so passionate about it so we were brainstorming a lot we came up with all these ideas we came with some eternal tribute internal ideas the developer hack night shirts and yes so as far as

the saris are external you know engagement with the community goes yeah so far we're doing hack nights so just like you said earlier we did couple of JavaScript pack night's meteor jjs and Jasper events yeah and we will we are currently talking to Chicago will be testing group organizer that's a new group so okay we hope to post post it okay well thank you very much for taking

the time to talk with me and make Phylly be able to send some people your way thanks thanks

hi it's mike with you testing up here go to top 2014 sending your Emily who's with thought works and she helps with some of their interactions with local technical community here in Chicago thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me so I mean what what is it how do you work with the user groups and what are some of the technical communities if you work with your in

chicago so i hope to organize the chicago gravina um that's a great great i'm sorry that's posted in the Chicago office code covers office ray does most of the work but I think it's great to host it at dollars every every month um and I help encourage that workers to attend that present okay and she's like my proxy for through into dollars so that way helps promote the community

install works as well as giving a place for thought I'm for the beatings to happen yeah yeah i think i was just looking down a large space in the young center and it's a great way to give back to the tech community to be able to host events like that and give people a platform to talk about what they're doing there's a lot of cool stuff going on the show that rug was pretty active

and it's wrong working the other groups that you work with so I've been pretty actively involved with a lingotek night in student in 1871 for the last year on the pelvis occasionally sponsors that is awkward so I've been helping and evangelize with your inside flowers I get people done more to attend and get involved in different products right and that's the open government with paul

baker and yeah yeah yeah all the movers and shakers here in Chicago sont texecom community solar when you're working with these people you know how does how does that work you the stuff works approach these are groups that it sees as being really active and special in the community or do you is your way to like apply like I ever use group how can I look this offer it's I think it depends

on the user group how we got into them they arranged my we're in in most cases dollars has been approached any great been hosting Chicago Ruby for four years so yeah I think originally maybe I don't even know the full story off that's right so we do so without loss to the industry but I think it's my satellite consistency of having it be in one location and then

for open go pack tonight some of us we got enough involved pretty early on and they were looking for some sponsors so that people don't have to be for their own pizza every Tom so I just happened to work out for us that time you know there are those are two very different styles of groups deserve and obviously one is on site once off site is desert is that change how you you interact

those communities order I do think we sponsor it easier to sponsor things inside the office um and it's we have this great space neon center that's something that we can contribute if people wanna host events we were able to post a really cool about leading up to python this year our people need practice talks and it's just if it's not a least not yet it's not a reoccurring

event um but um it was really cool and it was they need in a space and they wanted like a lot of people and we were able to provide that and help with the organizational details so I think that's a way we can help out with people that want to get people together in the tech industry to talk about something for sure what they're doing um I yeah I think that's easier in some ways right

right so when your route like if I'm a user group well I would love to be able to be associated with do they are specific place we should go to uni chart beach okay should I give me your email question it's usually just approached on one from that works till they really matter who there's not a big needle could we get an insider can meet usually talk to someone see if see if the days

that you're looking at is available and see if it's something about is aligned with what works is trying to do I think definitely we want to be actively engage with the Chicago Technic community there's a logical stuff going on l vs romantical stuff internally going to make sure we as much as we can between us to started in Atlanta yah if I meant usually border

hazard so you can even working with these communities for a while and I you know I remain on somebody's looking to start a user with what are some of the activities that you do that that are maybe so we might not realize that when I have to do wonder whether a user of like when you to talk about the logistics of included in things like that what are some tricks that you maybe

have learned about how them to manage those kinds of little details it's just blinking at how each event go the make sure you use the use what went well and what did it go well defeat in for the next one well that's really the best advice I can go I think we notice it to have a routine pretty recently that there was some time before the top two good start where people work Billy

interacting and all we were getting a lot of cool people together come but then they didn't know each other and they didn't know what to do so I talked with some the organizers and we actually decided to hey what if we like rearrange the chairs read them all in like to print clumps so that when people are sitting there when they arrive they sit with a group of people and they're not

just like sitting auditorium style of waiting for presentation let's see how it goes so we tried it and it actually worked for you all the other people what they pod we did find that people are interacting more plenty looking at each group is different so they're not like some rules but ignored for everyone it's going to really depend on your ear group size and what type of community or

attracting ah but I think just looking at what's working for you so just pay attention to what is and don't be afraid to experiment yeah well thank her have to take the past week we shake user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today

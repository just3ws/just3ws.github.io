hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here going to go to County 14 and I'm standing here with Neely who is one of the lead organizers here in Chicago there's your second year here in Chicago but go to confidence a it's a bigger organization than just Chicago well first I want to just say thank you very much for dinner I'm the speaking and how did you get involved with go to come was

that before chicago or it was before chicago i live in san francisco and i got involved through try for which is now the company that I worked for and I worked with them for qcom San Francisco okay and after that a gita told me that they had the plan to bring go to to the US because it's actually global this is a global conference so it happens all over Europe and we decided to bring to

the United States solutions we have an Amsterdam we are in Copenhagen and we just started Copenhagen this year okay we're in Denmark and Berlin step one here is well control over Europe yes you know not and then in the US are thrown together no this is it this is Chicago for now we have plans to grow but not really sure where to go but we decided to bring you know something nice to the

Midwest all right yeah so we're really happy I'll just show you vid was just a little underserved and that's what we heard and it's so nice because there's so many nice companies here that end developers that are very thankful that we're here yeah yeah and it's been a great conference and a great show out I mean we've had Tim Bray talking about privacy in the future of the browser and

then now Martin or dare ski is it's talking about Scala it's it's a very good conference to be yet but to just go back into your story okay about where you know you got involved with q con for you already organizing conferences is there something you were doing well organizing conferences just came naturally to me okay I am a graphic designer I come from Brazil so when I

moved to the u.s. to stay I wanted to have a career and it's kind of different when you're here and you kind of want to find Mitch so as a graphic designer I loved Britain too graphic design I love designing but it wasn't it's not really like my biggest passion so I start working with events so start managing marketing campaigns and from there I

wanted to be behind the scenes so I start going to conferences even as it turns later because I speak Portuguese and I understand spanish and i also speak english so a lot of conference managers would hire me to help them out so i wanted to do what they were doing surgery have you worked with conferences from coming from South America as well I worked in a couple conferences there but

he grew after I moved to the US and I think mostly because of Portuguese okay so that was a something different that I could offer so I start posting conferences and doing a lot of events and I really liked it here's why start living yeah exactly so I start leaving the design on the side to work as a conference manager so I manage like I said a few marketing campaigns and then

I wanted to work with conferences and met try for that came with the soft software side so and and that's how everything started ok and so you join them and then you want a coupon so that was that where the conference's you are working with before technical conferences not really ok so now so cute how much your first technical conference that pretty much ok so what did you see

the differences between working on and a non-technical and Ubisoft tech our conference coming over to a technical audience those are difference in how you approach check every conference you go you see a different crowd and it's funny to see how people react to different things yeah it was different and I and I really like the group that comes to our confidences so it makes just everyone is

very nice everyone is normally very polite and very appreciative of what we offer you're so I always feel very thankful after I work I don't get tired you know I get tired after I go better on Royal I am always like so excited that it you know it gives me so much good energy just see that people were actually be even if I don't understand everything

that's being said I try my best yeah you surprised how many people in the audience are understanding that there and I'm one of them yeah I don't always understand what I'm hearing either but it's sometimes it's just funny or anything yeah people talking about oh no I love learning I mean I mean I mean we learn every day so to me it's everything is new everything sounds new and I try

to understand a little bit I know of what are they talking about or the language is out there and what people want to learn do I can talk to the developers but yeah I mean I really like it then has it changed your perception of technology working with technology conferences did you see the technology community as is it I just you know computers or maybe less scary or when

you're listening to the news about Snowden or something you're like oh I here are some things I maybe understand a little bit better now definitely and it's out actually funny because i live in silicon valley so the tech world is we're surrounded by their technology so it's funny when I have to talk to a family member or friends that you know they they're not around like the tech

world all day every day like we are and I do understand and I kind of want to have conversations or talk about them you know something new that came out or you know a language that people are talking about or even an app that came out and people are like what what are you talking about so you're the one that's in the nose yeah for your family it's awesome right night and i love it

and i always liked technology said so I look back and I understand why I'm here so you know I always wanted to learn computers I was the first one in my group of friends that had an email you know so because I was always traveling and I was wanted to communicate I'm the one who told you know family about like applications that we can talk to each other so I'm always like aware and

always liked it to be aware so I think it everything just came together and I always like to ask about lessons that people have learned or how they've changed when they're doing conferences but I want to actually point out one you talked about a little bit before is that science or is non technical ways to ma up you has changed what dr that the normally kind of just

useless little lanyards are ya what is it that you didn't how did you come to do that so it was a group decision only one hand so i could only show it a little bit yeah so we so i can show you guys so this is a new badge concept that we came across so we do come to other conferences just to learn and what other people are doing so other than the lanyard and the badge with your name we

decided to play a little bit with the badge this year so we came with the idea to put all the information in your badge and we were just talking out a little bit ago so we put the schedule we do have a short explanation about the keynote speakers so you can have a better understanding of what's going to happen and it's in its with you all they threw through the conference you can

take the pages out if you don't want it too heavy i don't want to carry this but the positive thing is you have your schedule with you through the day and we're as like a manager in a conference that we're not getting too many questions so i will not be so it works so that freed you up from a lot of and also people just take anything losing the guy i'm notorious for those my own

yeah schedules but with this I've been able to just flip it and about talking to somebody by well yes and that well for me in particular when I'm talking with somebody said well let's schedule an interview and we're trying to figure out what session they want to be in I'm not you know futzing around trying to find the schedule or it's a teen thing I left it in the room yeah I forgot about

your yeah yeah or in this way is also good because we can save like printing material where's a week we you know because normally we print so many you know badges or things like that and then you have to print the agenda and there's more so we just did it at once and I'm really sure we're gonna keep doing this so I'm happy that DITA and I and our designer Molina decided to do this and I

think it's gonna be I think it's we're gonna try to apply to all of our conferences so if you're organizing a conference rethink the bad yes we also added the Seekers this year so we created like fun stickers where you can identify you know your ear yourself like oh I am a staff or I am a team team builder and it's an easy way to start a conversation with your you

know with someone close to you sirs oh and Ivan utilize this occurs you have to do it i'll have to do it before we yeah so and then it's almost like a keyboard doesn't know sometimes how to network in a conference or how do i start a conversation and as soon as you look to someone else's badge it's like oh hey i also work you know with web or whatever you do in your projects i'll just say i

don't really have that problem okay but we hear there are a lot of people yeah we try something on i I'm sorry but yeah I definitely magento yeah I'm not a joking a little bit but now i'm mostly the one chasing after people saying i cried come on let's go talk yeah but no that's great it's thinking of different ways to take this otherwise use the space it was just a name and a company

yeah Turnitin subject that's actually you know is feel useful and instead of being a poor yeah it's just another way to think about innovation yeah okay well thank you very much funding that baby so much I'm straight user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of

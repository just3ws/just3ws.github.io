user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with deep desk so here what visions chicago 2013 at the gene siskel film center absently donald ross hunger and she how with the chicago camps

chicago camps gorg cocaine plural and in with that refresh chicago which is a user community or design community here in chicago up thank you for taking the time to sit down with me on ross and trade so chicago camps that work what is that uh we do this year we're doing for single day events and we kind of modeled that off of camps camps have been kind of unstructured and free people come in

put their name on a board and they get to speak for a time slot and we structured them more than that so i think we kind of lie a little bit and we say camps the really single day events right but this year they've been fifty dollars we've had great speakers people like Samantha stormer jared school Fred Beecher x aqui warfel Jason cranford Teague christian coalition we've had

people coming from all over the country some remote sometimes in person to come in and give keynotes to two people who come in we do them at the harrington college of design this year and we cap that about a hundred over hundreds or so people to come and attend and they get a day full of really smart presentations yes year we had mobile camp speaker camp smokerise idea protec camp and sketch

camp is on november second so this is kind of like a framework for running events of different types that you're trying to build out I don't know that was the goal we have on now I think we spent this year we so Shay and I last year did prototype camp at Harrington and I was at a party of my wife and I sent Shay a text since I've got this idea we should try this so we did it and

it was fun people kept bugging us up mountain and bugging us is the wrong way they kind of really kept egging us on what are you gonna do next and so we brought in our friend Brad Simpson who does all the visual design and we came up with this brand that we want to start building we said let's learn how to work with each other this year and if it doesn't suck let's keep doing

it and I think we've had fun we've got to work with each other we've built a lot of relationships I think people are slowly but surely start and figure out that the event exists with a pretty much all sell out and people get mad that they didn't hear about them earlier right so what's a good bad problem it allows us to focus on the next event yeah which is great I think one of our

advisors gave us really good advice about that don't worry getting bigger space worry about your next event yep yeah and it sounds like that a similar pattern I've heard from like I interviewed Brad Smith and other event organizers that they have an event and then the next one just bigger it's it seemed like that seems to be if it's successful it's the next one I there's

not going to exist or it's gotta be making it doesn't need to be though yeah I don't I think we purposely have kept these small like I said we keep it around 100 people we've learned tons from that first one a year ago and before that I've worked on something called sketch camp Chicago which is the first version of what we're going to do and some larger conferences in the UX

community I think that we don't want to get the bigger this year so you want to say you want to have a formula so this is Chicago camps effect absolutely and we you know we have a formulas and we right now we've got space that we can do some things like have workshops where we're certainly investigating other spaces as we go when we partner with to do other types of events if you know

shade pulls together new workshop material and what's the point of the event how can we do that and make it reasonable for people but also make it you know valuable for everybody else anybody wants to attend we try to do that I think the biggest challenge is learning what people want and and in Chicago I think you have a lot of meetup groups you have refresh which certainly

has I think a standard of quality based upon Cheney and John Buddha who do that but i think the meetups tend to be a little more sporadic and we're not digging on those we love those we certainly go to those and participating those but we wanted to put on something that started to build a level of quality and expectation i think the fun thing we did this year is we got a craft brew

to blame you in a couple of every every event has a couple of different beers over um sometimes we get lucky and get a sponsor who will bring us cupcakes interesting food we had root beer floats their knowledge floats at prototype camp and we try to who can we get a sponsor will feed people so that again you're getting your I think our goal this year is if you spend two hundred dollars and

attend all of our events this year you'll get over a thousand dollars in value I think we've already nailed that that comes in books and software licenses you know you're not just talk about the content better no I mean this is this like new writers has continually been a sponsor rosenfeld media felt in their user interface engineering Duryodhan's company has given us

webinars which had value of anywhere from 100 to 150 dollars yeah books like you said we love field notes as a sponsor giving us a sketch pad we get pens and notepads from the nerdery and I mean move gives people free business cards if they sign up and so we really do try to add as much values again we got it Subaru this year the little prototyping bunnies and I'm really and

so so it sits by coming to these events you're going to get some learning but also this is an M&A for sharing when a sponsor comes in they go the expectations they don't simply just throw some money at you in it anymore are they ever get much do something cool yeah we could use more money oh there's more money we love more money as a food for you to give to us what we've learned

this year too is that our core audience we certainly have people who are in that really junior but our core audience is probably between five and 15 years of experience that's about fifty percent of our audience and then about twenty-five percent on either side so to us one of these days we'd love to see a recruiter come in and save what we'd love to feed that those people yeah you know so I'm

sure somebody's willing to give up a business card for a sum I think even last year would we have we had group of the back book at a pep oh yeah that mind that was by a fight like amazing that people were bragging for the whole list like I don't know is really fat ass yeah so so we try to bring that value to the event in terms of again all the things that you get

sponsors sponsors don't really give us that much money our sponsorships or low price because I really just want to make it a great experience for people I think we've gotten better at that we've taken we've taken some lumps on things we could do better we've changed our formats that we have longer presentations now I think our first one I in mobile camp we tried to do 20

minutes and that was a lot of speakers and it was just rushed and so we learned and that's kind of the goal is scheduling an event is tough so we are getting better at it so so it looks like Chicago camps at org is a is a professional organization for doing events is that is I dripping focus with that so no yeah for now I defined it I mean we're just we're at the point very

very honestly where we have to have a 2014 planning meeting and we have to figure out what we're going to do next year we have some things in mind there have been rumors floating around around bigger event they're not really and it's rumors that there may be a bigger event that happens a different location but you know like i said i think we wanted to before we even try spreading rumors

that there might be a bigger event learn how to work together kind of build a brand and feel like we're not just rushing into something lined you know we wanted to kind of learn a lot yeah a lot and and then I think put ourselves in a position where we're not taking on a lot of risk right and so it's kind of interesting that seeing each in Russia moving from having a user group

community and it builds up some experience running vans and being involved in other events that more necessarily like building infrastructure now you're certain it takes of those experiences and turn them into something that's actually going to help fund your life's as well I definitely hasn't hit that point yeah so it's a lot of it is we're still buying our own iPad yeah we

don't think we've taken anybody home this year no no i mean so it all goes back into the company of what we're doing so these events will fund the next event so that we can bring out speakers and things like that so it's so when something call me surfing there it's really critical then that when i when they pay the money just isn't buying your next report this is well it's a

fifty-dollar event with i mean when you look at a fifty-dollar event and um and a hundred people you know look the maximum on that is five thousand dollars or any look at things like space and food and other things that come into play with this in we try to do speaker gifts we don't I mean look we've been lucky this year that our rolodex of great people have worked for great

companies that have sent them on their dime so we haven't any pay for that we try to buy them a nice meal and kind of hang out but we don't I mean we really we don't have a big budget to do anything like that so we're we're essentially um this year we incorporated became real legit business yeah haha IRS um okay oh that's awful but we did that so I said on it yeah edit edit this huh

um we did that so we could become a business and be you know legitimate about it and makes it easier to take money from the people inside and ask about is when you're dealing with the money and you're just individuals it's very hard yeah and there's I mean believe it or not there's businesses that still only take a check so we have to we have a checkbook and a bank

account that's Chicago camps and that allows us to like I said try something so i think you know we've tried to save a little bit money money there's deposits you have to pay for things there's all kinds of stuff i think we're kind of working around that and making sure that we do as much as we can smartly with them yeah my ability all those kind of things that are costs

money there are all kinds of things like you have that often it and and you know we really want to make sure that people i mean like i said it's a fifty dollar bet I don't even know what the cost of flat efficient is but it's a few hundred dollars and exist yeah and we're we're trying to give similar quality to to our folks in Chicago and at the same time we take submissions from people in Chicago

so you know somebody wants to give it get a sketch Campo November second and Hareton college of design to a very blessed man sir um but you're assuming this is going to be published before they I am feeling this is some connections when I can publish but if somebody wants to do that they can submit through the website and one of the things we do is we love first time

speakers or people who are trying to get on stage that's why we have multiple tracks and we try to bring them and help them you know if they're struggling will help them write their proposal and I've a whole book about first time speakers coming out in November but that's that's something that we try to do as well I mean we love Chicago we're doing the dependent hopefully to some degree being

a rising tide lifts all ships if that doesn't come across as as arrogant no no that's that's actually one of the goals of one of the things that we do desk I'd like to promote the the local community and I'm also in the video and I enjoy being part of it so you know everybody wins and it sounds like you have that kind of outlook with our own campuses you're doing something that you're

passionate about and that's building the community and having these events and being a part of them and also supporting local community and helping people that maybe even fledgling speakers absolutely yeah and I mean like a chain Brad both putting like I said we kind of joked that in a branch of designer but he's so much more than that he's brought so much to the table Shay with all of his

experience with refresh and and all of those things myself with previous events I think we all kind of do a good job of we keep each other to counterbalance it's really really honest yeah yeah we're also not afraid to throw the elbow when it needs to be done like just slow down factor so it's kind of nice so in how much has for you ashay having run refreshed Chicago for a while and built

up pretty large community how useful is that by coming into chicago camps and being able to come and run these more structured events and how much of the lessons are you bringing not a whole lot yeah completely honest no it's it because it's a completely different ballpark it really is um refresh we can sit I want to say it's not difficult plan but really minutes we have groupons

been ongoing sponsor for years so as far as what my budget is or our budget is for those events and what we can do with it like kind of know what that is already we generally have two to three meeting places we can go to that we've build relationships with and then really outside that it's finding a speaker right and we sit down usually the beginning a year and say we'd love for

these people to speak we've sent out invitations and we can usually booked up refresh you know ten months ahead of time and then it's not quite autopilot right but there's just a few touching base here and there becomes fairly so just keep on yeah and these events are quite the opposite and since um lots of basecamp action yeah lots of mailing list action committees because it's

you're dealing with more speakers at a given time yeah you're collecting BIOS and headshots websites and abstracts and then building a schedule for that stuff you're doing all you know and communicating with all the people write the speaker there's more sponsors attendees as I said so some gift um it a lot hasn't really getting over as much as you would hope everything he lies a

lot of his connections and experience have really made us getting up to speed in Chicago a lot easier I mean that's just the truth she's shea is is kind of the connected man around town he might not be cranes tech 50 yet but uh each other so it should be vocal Shay no I don't think you can vote on those they said you can vote no okay yeah okay well thank you 40 times to tell thanks

revolution thank you thanks see you November second user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today at Utah State calm you

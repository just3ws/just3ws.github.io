hi it's mike with you task i'm here again it go to kop 2014 and well I'm this is the interview is a little different than most of them where I've talked with people that maybe are in the community that I don't necessarily know but Brian Gary here is a friend of mine who's been we've co-organized user groups together we've known each other we've done to each other's houses and

you know our kids have played together but we met at a conference much like much like Gocha comp you're at SCA 2009 our software craftsmanship North America I can remember it you were sitting at the table and I walked up to me like hi I'm Mike where you from yeah because I just wanted to engage or somebody and turned out we live in the same neck of the woods yeah which is fairly uncommon

yeah usually I different mangu either lives in like city which is far from us or they live in another state so what you live like 15 minutes from my house so but it's just that chance you know that when you open yourself off at a conference and that's kind of what I'm getting at is when you open yourself up to these opportunities you never know what's going to come out of them but one

moment we didn't know each other and then now we're you know here years later having run a user group together and in you know been friends for a while uh so I would normally say thank you for taking the time to speak with me but I I don't have to thank you but but no thank you for taking the time to be on the camera though ah so ryan right now you're the one that's leading up scmc

seoc is a is a group we started together it's soft craftsmanship McHenry County oh but for the last some like your plus you've been kind of letting it solo how is it how's it going I have been good good i'm not completely running it solo so Michael Rozelle is helping me as well I'll she yeah yeah I need to bring in more people so user groups are great it's been going well what I find

is that I will have a backlog of like three topics lined up and then we'll get to that backlog I don't know how the month or it's like oh wow yeah so yeah like I need to pull something out and just make something up which has worked before yeah you can have really good discussions we have one of those abeka member and it went really well but it's kind of like booster

famine and you have to constantly be keeping that backlog go so is how having having a bigger leadership team helps with that problem because you can set the net below the yeah exactly yeah that's one of the things is that the scmc is a far suburban group it is yeah yeah so we live in the Chicago metropolitan Nick Collison area and there's a ton of user groups in downtown

Chicago there are some usergroups spreader on the suburbs but Mike and I live pretty far northwest of the city and 50 60 miles audacity yeah and there were no technical user Goethe there but there are a decent amount of developers out there because people move there because it's for housing whatever reason you know the whole point for me of the group was really to foster that local

development because I think it so easily gets overshadowed with what's happening in downtown Chicago and it's really about you know establishing those relationships between the people in that area yeah yeah there was I mean there's follett the dissolve obviously a very large library service library services company in education and education and then before those tickets now which is

now been consumed by ticketmaster moved away but there's still a lot of developers that live on that way then that are they commute in or they work and then you know there's no real community around the ethical yeah so originally Mike and I started the group Mike did the most of the initial setup and it was originally the topic was cloud development yeah computing and

yeah we do that for what about a year and a half yeah and then just we ran out of topics they're like yeah let's do something different and so we kind of have that and I was like 2009 yeah yeah yeahs 2010 is when we first had our first scmc meeting and then yeah we're at gym in from from a bloody gym choo choo neo from the night and that was the first time we actually had like a

corporate sponsor so that's when follett sponsored our location and then help yeah and they don't follow what else the sponsor food it responsive food your groupon of the time famous mother be so having like that that corporate support was really it really need help the other thing that really increased our attendance at meetings as when we switch to meetup com oh yeah which was

surprising because you know we wouldn't expect that that would have that dramatic impact it really did I want to say like a fifty percent increase well discoverability yeah yeah yeah and they do some help with if you're already a member for one group they send you a little suggestive for four areas something might be near your and your interest meetup com auto next people to

come to user group when it gets closer to the date so that's helpful too yeah so yeah so and that actually uh even though we didn't have a corporate sponsor for the cloud developers group we met at a panera we might hit a hello are even for the for a while first was a life already but uh you know and but that was okay yeah that was that was we had a power through them we did wasn't

always easy and sometimes quite painful but you know it goes into something that I've been talking about about building humidity in 24 months in one little thing this is it doesn't really matter where you me because when you're trying to build a community it's not necessarily that you're at follett or at a group on reddit Heath I do is that you're just somewhere or people get

together and talk shop talk about whatever don't but whatever is on their mind with with the community and can speak a similar language and feel some empathy towards each other as if we share common interests in industry but now you're you're kind of expanding and you're doing another new informal meet up so you're you've got the bug out for organizing what is this a little you've

been doing a coffee yes what I got the shot for tin coffee can in yeah so I let me tell you history that so I started working from home three years ago a full time and I was working with people also liked in our area and we would just get together to work at coffee shops and since then like that group that I was working with this spread apart and you know working for

different companies but it's still really nice to get to that group together still to this day and like hand a coffee shop see how we're doing you know even even like will collaborate on on technology things so so yeah I've become the social director of the hormone McHenry County beat up at a coffee shop group a great acronym so just much longer just don't it I

probably should formalize it and even even put it on be calm but that's kind of one point I've done so far it goes to show like how you can do community in in a variety of ways yeah yeah and and even it can just foster those relationships that we haven't worked yeah definitely I really and I think a lot of motivation for me behind the coffee shop stuff has actually heard on a podcast like five

years ago that there was this small city like 100 miles outside of Paris and a lot of people work from home and work from whatever their company was in a major European city but they had this co-working space where they would get together for half the day just so they had that camaraderie so that's they know living in mchenry county you either have an extreme commute or you work locally

or you work from home so like having that that attachment to the communities is really helpful right so i will write i'll see you in a few minutes voila thanks for taking time to check my camera it's been too long yeah thanks thank you right by user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community

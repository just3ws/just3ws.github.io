user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at SEMA 2013 and right now I'm sitting down with Steven Anderson who his up to recently ran the mat railers group up in

Madison Wisconsin thank you for taking the time to sit down with me I you know I understand that you were running this group for for a long time but some life events have come up and you've had to identify how to transition the group over so that way it could still exist well how did you go back to that how did you identify okay the plan well the the group was passed to me in 2007 my friend

who started the group kind of asked me if I would take it over because he was moving on to make some other things happen on his teaching front he started and just like he had started a rails class in 2006 he started an iOS development class in the tech college in 2007 very cutting edge and he was just clearing his plate to make something new happen so I was running mad railers for

years but along the way even though I was the kind of the figurehead and the person whose picture was on the the users group there were many other people who were putting in as much effort as I was I was just the the point person who who kind of chose who to delegate to on a frequent basis and part of the time the dynamic was kind of a core group of us making things happen and part of the

time it was me or someone else in the court who just delegating and making sure that an interesting event happened every month right there was a point years ago when i started not maybe about years ago at least between two and one year ago i'd already started talking about maybe it's time to pass the torch find somebody else to run it who will bring more

energy than myself at this point in time my interests of like to do for many of us you know you know what you're passionate about goes through phases and different steps and I've become really interested in the dynamics running building growing our business which is a different set of skills that I'm really intriguing and pulled towards and I waited to pass the torch until it was

pretty clear this year it was very clear because Zach step forward with a vision for conduct refreshing the content making it more attractive to the most experienced ray rails developers we had made a very successful effort to make the group attractive for new rails programmers and now so Zach pointed out that that was kind of causing us to be dissin gay causing our most experienced

rails community members to be disengaged from the groom so let's swing the pendulum back right and he's been doing that and in recognition of the fact that he was doing more for the group than I was I asked him if he'd take it over so so it was a it was a happy transition it sounds like he was already somebody that you had been fostering in a community and then having more and more of the

other responsibilities over is that um I wouldn't put it that way zach is I mean he he didn't need any Foster ah no he's somebody who makes things happen yeah and my business partner brad is working with him to run the users group it's the two of them currently and I'm sure there will continue to be a larger extended core of people running it I wanted to step back for a couple of reasons one is

to let the group refresh with more energy more enthusiasm than I was bringing to the table and also to clear my plate I'm trying to get things to fall and play it into place so that I can teach a night class at uw-madison in the spring web development with open source tools so often us professional programmers we like to complain about the gap between what we do and what is

taught in computer science curriculum you're looking down find it I'm dying the world to close that gap yes and that's exciting to me and it's going to be challenging i taught five classes of rails at the tech college and that was a great fantastic experience I think it is going to be I'm going to take us a bit of a different approach with the University and I'm looking forward to it

i hope everything falls into place do you think you won't one was that it's kind of funny that the last person that handed off the group went to teach and now you're going off to teach so eventually zach is going to be a teacher so Zach now knows that is his future holds a teaching course in one of the medicine university oh he would be killer yeah he would do a really great

job all in a few years I'll be interviewing him and talking to him go handing off from a trailers to the next generation and it's a it's a it's a very interesting thing to see this community that was started and fostering grown and maintained and nurtured and then it continues on and I've talked with a few people about that today is that we can build things in a way that's much like

our software we can build it so that way it can be owned by something else in the litterhouse be honest we can take that attitude towards our communities and try to build that in a way that when we step away when we go away for whatever reason it keeps going it doesn't just poop all of the there's some interesting details as part of that conversation so for example my company Brad and I started

the company bendy works but it was an offshoot from users group from mad railers we've been very closely aligned with Matt railers over the years and we have run the events in our offices and bought you know bought the food and the drink and kind of bend the de facto sponsor a lot of the time and we've had many conversations about is this a good thing

is you know what are the pros and cons the pros are you know we make it happen it's consistent people know where to go every month right I think the possible comms are we don't want either in reality or people's perception we don't want people to feel like the users group is about our company because that's not the point the user groups should be its own thing and perhaps it's damaging if

it's a little bit too closely aligned in people's perception with it with a commercial company if it becomes the bendy works man railers yeah it can also be damaging for other consulting firms in the area that have developers and would love to go to the user group but it's a competition and they might be afraid that you're going to poach them or yeah well I never heard those

specific concerns but I'm hearing from the people who go to the user if I'm not hearing for the people who don't go right right exactly well your consider me there are advocates then one thing that was really cool that happened this year is our public library did a huge remodel and they're reinventing themselves as kind of a collection of makerspaces really they've got some

gorgeous tech meeting spaces that are larger and better equipped than then rooms that we specifically remodeled space and bendy works to allow the library is a step above that so we've moved the users group to the public library so that that helps as well that's very interesting that the local community would be recognizing that need or desire I do you have me

inside how that came to be I talked to the gentleman who is kind of the impetus at the library and he tells me this is a national movement that libraries are struggling to reinvent themselves and one of the things they're turning towards is providing a public space and venue for for teaching people how to make things and and to share skills that's interesting well good luck in

your new venture and i hope the class turns out really good and thanks for all those years of putting in the effort on man railers well thank you my user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm you

hi said this is my call saying that was Sergio Pereira he runs the Chicago all type net user group and I'm just going to ask him a few questions about his groove we'll start off with that well what is Chicago all done so it's very hard to define what autonet is I'm not gonna dare try to define it something that you wanted to find defining when you're starting out dot net but I can

give a few trades that could more or less describe the group so i think we are mostly developers that are going after the continuous improvement and improvement of self or processes or in also the quality of the software that you're right we like to think we are not necessarily dotnet developers but we are developers that happen to use dotnet a lot probably like that net a lot and i

think we we try to also give a little bit of a voice to things that are good practices good components good methodologies that may or may not come from microsoft it may or may not even need that map necessarily so we try to give space for those things to be talked about so they so it isn't just about technologies that are related to microsoft not but things like testing

and ya hala things like that okay so um you know that was that was also net but do how do how do people find out about jail site yeah so well we do have we do have our side we have Chicago Walt done that yeah moving today we have an account on Twitter hello mailing list reality this site and all the communications are mostly about our events and meetings there's no

propaganda of any type of thing there it really just about the group events but you can find out by subscribing several ways i mean i think the site has everything you need to know to get info about the group well so you know we can contact you via the site or be the Twitter you said that there's a mailing list I'm sure all that swing through it's all I site it's a calendar is

everything okay and I'm so what is your kind of your meeting schedule you hold regular meetings it's a monthly I weekly how to do it yeah we have a monthly meeting we almost always meet on the second Wednesday of the month we meet sears tower's we list hours at redpoint technologies it's usually why got we start 630 coconut on those days and it's once a month why do you want to go with

6 30 y 6 30 like 65 clock I think they're you know I don't really know why it just has always been 6 30 i guess it is not too bad for people that work in the city and it's viable for people they're catching the train okay in the suburbs in a so I feel like how many people typically do you see it a meeting what is Jennifer I mean you've been doing this a while about over the last

couple years how many people have you typically see do you see a few people or is it I think so I think in that an average mini-moon hell at 25 people yeah we we have capacity about of 50 and we hit that several times but normally it's really around a 25 so it's a pretty good size I think group for anyone that even has not necessarily given talks to other user group

go I think I encourage our members to give talks they'd probably give talks to their you know development he PR and it's just a little bit of a next step to bring their tops to our user group okay so I mean you try that not just bring in external speaker if you're trying to cultivate speakers oh for sure for sure I think so especially dotnet that net so funny dotnet developers of funny type of

developers I mean they have grown up being told what tools to use house we do things mostly by Microsoft there's not a you know it's kind of comes with the territory when you work that Nets a bottle of platforming businesses and enterprise and it kind of comes with the kind of developers that even up have any dotnet and so there are not a lot of dotnet speakers that are into

non-microsoft minutes some are but they don't talk about there's no venues for them to talk about so one way to change that with the latest one of the charters of our group is to create more speakers within the community and so we really try to get our members to be encouraged to present on topics and how often you're going to find a dot net user group that that we invite you to talk

about in hibernate a goal sharp yeah or ayran ayran Ruby my butt well I have to say that the first user group I ever once you wash eyeballs on that and the first user group I ever spoke it was scrabble than that so ago that's why I wanted to help you first off it's uh yeah sure all tonight as always even though i'm not in the dot that kind of me anymore it's always going to all the

special place my heart so ultimately it really come and comes down to you for you been doing this for years now why do you do why do you why do you continue to properly maintain it yeah so we started this group in late two thousand seven we had a few form of me help myself Derrek Lee to her igen yeah then we had a lotta no get together with more people think you might have a pen

and some of those and I think for me is the opportunity to or I participate in the process of changing the dot net developer type of definition or stereotype you know I think there's a lot of room for improvement in your average net developer don't like the terminology but in reality that's what it is and I think that over the last four years not because of my group of

course not but I've seen so many changes in net I mean he's your pseudonym shaped with jquery right really that's that's huge if you look back four years so there are many things changing their Microsoft is an abusive last bunch of those things change over the last four years because of feedback and pressure from people some of those where associated without dotnet back then and

I think that makes the dot net developer better developer having access to things that are just normal not a platform so you to enjoy being able to give developers might not otherwise have an opportunity to voice their thoughts and ideas and what they're passionate platform to come and warn about all the people smashing them to also share them what I want to give let me and regular

dot that developer chance see better ways of doing things that he might not have a chance to see different it's different i believe it's better although i cannot be running down so i do believe it's better but to my opinions right and come because they hope it's better they don't know for sure but they hope it is and i do want them to have a chance if I could I would

have I would like to bring every single dot and above that worked with me through the handles these because I think it could be changing for them to see you know see how that's driven development is done how he gave your dream and development works so many people don't build up those things we serve is just not part of the dust and culture it's very spy organization of

course there's always a good places that we could wipe out but it's not the room and I think that by having those people come and see ideas from other other platform to other groups or developers brought to that net leaving dotnet technologies are just not mainstream they don't have a voice you don't have a magazine that shows them all the time it's the place it'll come see those

things and judge for themselves a way if it's going to work for them or not and there and there are people speaking and showing those things they have facts and numbers and examples of other languages and even from dotnet that they believe it works they want to show you that were true I think that small as small I said truck like being part of that helping people a lot and I think if any little

bit all thing that I could do to help not that developer becomes become better right I think I I want to try it exactly it's really great and you're just a few more specifics about the meetings themselves you said typically see in a range of 20 25 GC people coming like repeat you sort their regulars or you continually see new people to see is is so huge so we do have regulars of

course we have for group of people that be there no matter what every month if it even if it's something that I have already learned just lightning out so we have people that are there every month we have depending on the topic we have lots of flying that are not done and development just because we're not necessarily talking about that net topics every time we r dot that

developers but we're to help we mingle with all the other person all plant or leave the last museum or the community is sound Kanban it was it was specially yes so okay a nap not everybody was about no developer day well then just I think it's awesome that that's that's that's the thing I all my participation in community events I make sure it's not above God Nessa bounce off to develop

for cheap in Chicago campus on the same thing we try to not make it about nothing even if it's heavy on Gardner but it's not exclusively done in a you know and again just so much questions about the meetings themselves did you prepare food oh yeah I don't worry about that a guaranteed karakia food everything our sponsors main sponsor is red white which give us the space and

dinner so it's every month never don't think we ever had a month that we could have gotten so thanks for pretending like this yeah Victor sell it to it is nice and in the typical format is it you usually hear people or give or do hands-on exercises it's more of the presentation style people talk that's where the there's a clash of culture and not now or I we tried

several times to have more hands-on events and more participative type of meetings yeah and they just didn't go as well as we thought they should have gone I think people fortunately unfortunately that's just a my day a weapon that they is expected to attend those user group meetings and sit down and watch your presentation and the end ask questions and well eventually participate during

the presentation asking questions but that's the extent that they expect to see in a.net musical minute we had other occasions that we tried muscling all this open open projector night or anybody could come with any 10-minute presentation are very similar to like tops yeah and just keep their tops and each barely work it's kind of missions yeah it barely works so most of the

people that came with the people that want to talk nobody came to see them talk so I just realized it's not a lot of interest we used to have a beginning to medium divided into sections a shorter presentation and then more of a debate or Koosh ball any still first few work then people start leaving after the presentation to desk I Steve what they're there for is the presentation so

we kind of got one problem and also questions after you try to start food early so people can mingle and network and poor thing and just have presentation at the end I think that's what most people are are interested in seeing every kind of there it's funny because they are interesting to see that in danger whatever reason they like someone to be

there to select topics right the purchase a little charade yes you know it's not it's not the dot that meetings are very different from Chicago ruby movies I mean it's not like people to all in the Middle East and they offer togs and and they volunteer to do dogs or more discussion with next topic would be for whatever reason that I don't know that just doesn't really work well maybe

they bitches we didn't figure out how to make it work yet so I'm in that role of me and Eduardo trying to find the speakers and the topics that could be in line with the group's interest it has been working with me doing this for almost four years now good great well again this is sergio Ferrara with Chicago all die happy thank you very much for replying my first interview

amount of take care

hi I'm Mike I'm here it should have a web conf again and now I actually have the shirts i can represent i'm sitting here with jonathan bolts jonathan runs the force calm and the Heroku user groups here in Chicago in that's kind of an interesting combination of groups force Salesforce and Heroku one's very lean and a mite and the other one is a little bit more enterprise-e and this is

what what why the two groups well I started organizing the first comm developer user group in chicago in a round i believe it was April or May of 2010 and over the time I you know it became one of them the largest start the most in the most impactful user groups in the nation and in i believe it was the middle of 2011 salesforce actually purchased Heroku um and I was actually

asked to start one of the first hiroko user groups here in Chicago because Salesforce knows the how big the community Technical technology community is in Chicago and they wanted to start building up a community and community users around America and they wanted us to be different on the first okay Anna so when you see the most impactful like what is what is what do you do that for

second meeting it's like like with the enterprise your groups I'm not too familiar with those do you present on on product or how to use the product or well yes I guess I might have used the word in Pecola involved I guess it's okay by involved meaning we're continuously having meetings every month um and I you know we continuously post things and Twitter and the internet

sometimes a lot of the a lot of veal there are a lot of user group sales force use groups around but there weren't that made developer user groups who go in depth into the platta the force.com platform rather than the administrators and how to use it so now to admitting just do the administration's stuff so and we also have a lot of developer

evangelist come talk or do it Google Hangouts with us so it's a continuously involved in and buy in volume and then so through the involvement we sort of make an impact and people like look at us as a pattern okay and so like other user groups and other cities are looking what you're doing yet say no how can we we can replicate some of what they're doing on Congo that's really interesting

position to be in the the the two different perps I have to imagine you get a different audience between Heroku and in Salesforce yes do you get the same people and both or is it totally different well sometimes you can you get a few people who do go to both both of meetings and these are the people who you know it's forced comments is Heroku which is a polyglot platform meaning you

can use money like different languages on it um and they're not interested in sort of you know only learning what they want to learn they won't learn everything they want to learn technology they won't learn how you know maybe the way that certain people use use something of java on Heroku maybe that can you know I can use that idea that concept in my for second development and

so so those are the people who go to both but you know between the two of them it with the force com user group you find of some administrators who want to learn more about development to hardcore invested other statesmen if you may Salesforce developers who you know want to either present or hear other people present on the platform where it's Heroku you get a wide variety it

supports Python Java Ruby node Scala then that's just the official build pack yes exactly and so you get a wide variety of people who just you know depending on the topic that's going to be presented they will either come or not come okay and with the so would you say that the force comm group is a little bit more pragmatic what can I do to make my life

a little bit better whereas maybe the Heroku group seems to be a little bit more it's just neat yeah yes yes one hundred percent okay and uh you know I have said I've had to touch some sales force and I didn't have nice things to say about it it was and that's not an indictment of this and you get people coming to the group and some of that is probably just not knowing the platform

well enough but did you get some people that come to the meeting and have of maybe a chip on their shoulder about sales force is it does I sometimes I have mixed feelings about enterprise software they they're trying to do something good trying to create something but sometimes people get frustrated we might take our frustrations out on a corporate vendor a

little bit harsher than we would an open-source vendor so they get a little bit more of a venom yeah do you get ever get saw sometimes I mean you don't get that many I mean a lot of times people don't go to the user group if they don't want to know about the topic it's a lot of the people that do come are using it or are interested in using it on or have like you mentioned have used it and but

want to know more about it those people that do have the venue that that venomous feeling they just need to I mean a lot of times that when that happens it's someone will talk to them and then show them the right way to do it or suggest that you go to the user or the discussion boards a developer force calm and ask questions about it because there's a wide variety I'm a discussion

board or Y divided a variety a variety of people on the discussion boards who are willing to help everyone and that that will actually quite give them the answer and then you know the whole idea is like don't get frustrated just ask someone yeah and then you you know you might it might make it better right in and also I mean along lines of receiving the venom the sympathy for the

developers I I I know some sales force developers in this this poor parcels with with because they have to take on all the responsibility because a lot of other people are aren't as either as well either lack of interest more or just just don't know it as well tend to try to push as much responsibility on them as possible is there is there some sense

of relief may be coming into a four second group is like our the Blood Brothers we've we've done battle together is this is there may be a little bit more identification with with a forced Commodores there is in I mean there is somewhat but it that's not what we're looking for I mean it's not really a close-knit group of like okay now yawn i'm like i don't know i don't know but

soldiers or policemen or firemen are people who have you been it you've been in things together you like your this camaraderie this is you know sympathy or empathy it's actually just like i won't learn more or less feel things about you know what's the positive yeah and then you mentioned that regarding you know that people would push tests or issues on to the sales force developers and the

reason is because not many people do have this knowledge and and that's really part of the reason that i took over the user i started the user group in chicago and my main focuses is like this platform is completely wide-open if you want to learn it you don't have to pay a cent right at all you get a free developer environment all the documentation is free and if you have

questions come to a user will help you yeah we'll provide you know the information or help or direction and it's hard to get that message out and it's hard to find people who are interested or one no more most of the people are recruiters who just want to hire someone and it's like you need to grow people before you actually put them out towards the world okay it is certain

plans for a force oriented conference or anything in Chicago um upcoming a right now the plan is in the works for a a sort of a developer a small developer you know evening conference and the 24th of October okay the location is set yet but it's coming up one of my main ideas and then for 2013 is to either have a force calm cloud your web camp day like like this conference here today or say

cloud computing web conference where you bring in a jury bring an AWS to bring in force calm ya beaucoup and developers that work on that platform together for a day just talk and compare notes and compare platforms and and get that together and sort of build up the the user group in the community with in Chicago okay and you know I full wrap up here you're going to be doing a

lightning talk and user community yet so yeah get some thoughts about that what was what was the topic of the lightning talk it's it's called community not dictatorship okay it's community not dictator yeah okay so what does that mean um a lot of people who go to user groups a lot of people enjoy going to bridges groups and they look at the people who host them or organize them or

set the meetings up on either eventbrite or meet up and they look at them for okay tell me where to go tell me what to do Who am I going to see and it's like the their organizers they're not leaders right it's a community the organizers they're too organized into say hey group this is where we're going I talked to this person I've gotten this location right

on today we're gonna go there it's not saying hey I did I found this place I found this speaker it's gonna be on this day you know they're not dictators you know if you want to hear topic yeah if you have a good idea of a speaker that you want I want to hear if you have a place that's a host let us know what the organized yeah it's it's not it's a very subtle difference stream I got less

meeting place on this day versus we're going to be meeting at that place on this yes correct there's there's a set up a big difference it's that I wanted the effort to get this you know I hope it's not about me yeah boy yeah vs if you don't like it just you know you don't yeah and another thing is that like if you are interested in that sounds like a great meeting to you put

it on Twitter put on your blog put on your website because as a right now I mean we you know the way that meetup works you can only email members of the group and if people don't know about the group or not signed up they're not going to know about the meetings and it's that networking is that marketing that message to be sent out that it you know in order for these user groups to be to

thrive in a grow and to build we need that work do we need that you know extra step for each from each member to push the message out and every link back helps yes correct you know and it's not just twitter if you can blog about it and you can even put on the facebook groups or even set up a facebook fan page for wow ok what is this facebook you have no yourself the fan page

because every place you can help disseminate information correct yeah ok well thank you very much making your time thank you Oh

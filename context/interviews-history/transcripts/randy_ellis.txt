user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today at Utah State com hi it's Mike again with you tastic today I'm sitting down with Randy Ellis brandy is the lead ambassador for the apster damn Chicago absurd am NOT Amsterdam

Amsterdam Chicago user community hi Randy thanks for taking the time to sit down with me it might nice to meet you again we saw each other go to conference here in Chicago the first one here actually in chicago and it was a great time meeting you and to learn more about you tastic thanks thanks yeah and it was great to learn about Amsterdam interviewed Mike Lee while i was there

and i kind of got a good idea of just how much how big this movie was i had never heard of before but can you tell me a little bit about how you got into apster damn and what is absurd am and what is it doing here in Chicago I just like the first comment on your interview with Mike Lee that was a great interview that you have with them and Mike's just a great guy I got to meet him later on

in the process and we'll definitely go into that later on the interview but a great guy and then go into your other questions about how I became interested in actually I'm yeah the funny that how the journey started is initially I was going to create my own organization I came from a business internship back in 2011 and I felt once i commenced out of that program i felt that we needed a

more community based in regards to people learning different technologies different platforms and different experiences when it came to technology so i started doing my research and started saying hey you know maybe i can start this on my own within course that became a very heavy lifting project within itself very cumbersome you know how it is as far as you know when you're

starting your own business you know so I had other projects other interests that was also in parallel with that so then I started digging a little deeper as far as what currently exists here in Chicago or just in the country for that matter and you know other other organizations that i came across and i looked at their criteria i looked at their requirements and you know some of them

even you know they had like membership fees and I didn't feel like that was you know necessary when it came to a person wanting to learn I wanted to make sure that everything was free of access knowledge is free at the end of the day we have the internet now it's not like we have to go to the library 15 some odd years ago and and learn about a specific topic of interest now at a push of a

button we have instant gratification as far as how much information that you want to learn of course doing your property diligence because you know you know you can be a bit overwhelmed exactly was focus exactly you know so after you know I did my property diligence after dam was a clear choice I said hey um you know I want to learn more about this company and they

recently finished doing it was one particular you're gonna want to say WWDC not this year but the year prior so I started looking at their press in regards to and I said hey you know do they have a organization or do they have a community here in Chicago and of course didn't see it so I was like hey this is a no-brainer up you know you know this is you know Chicago is a

budding technology ecosystem with a lot of people a lot of talent a lot of creativity so it was just me going in contacting after damn so I took the shot I corresponding with him sent an email out so I'm saying hey you know my name is grant yellow yadda yadda yadda and I would like to bring a embassy here to Chicago so after that honestly I didn't expect to hear anything back you know so

maybe I think maybe a couple of weeks went by and then I got a response from a lean and the lame is the embassy coordinator and he came over and he didn't come over but he responded back to me and said hey we think that's an awesome idea let's talk over skype I haven't talked with a lame as well as Paul Darcy was the CEO of a bastard am and we just took it and ran from there I

started getting the embassy kid information and here we are today so it sounds like it's a lot more than just oh I'm going to slap a logo on my user group and call an absurd am there's I mean you describe the concept of embassy ambassadors CEO so that sounds like it's a lot more organized than a typical organization user your organization so is is the wait what when you say that

you're an ambassador here and there's embassy here in Chicago what what does that mean well typically what that means is we are we call ourselves a meta organization that's you know part of our mission and what that means for those that don't know is a metal organization is part is of an umbrella and then you have little embassies with under that umbrella sort of like subsidiaries and

in that entity kind of runs itself it governs itself within its own world we still follow the same mission we still follow the same goals we still have the same advocacy that we would if we were the headquarters in the Netherlands but we apply our own culture you know you look if you closely look at all of our embassies are overseas in different countries and as well as different

cities if you look at our logos our logos incorporate our culture so if you look at the Chicago after them you'll notice the water tower logo with the Chicago stars if you look at after damn you will see different icons of their culture so we kind of morph we embrace our culture because we don't want to bring a culture that is not of our sales from where we're from because that so

you have there's the there's the style the themed encompass same organization but each individual region has its own identity that still retains it belongs to it's part of this greater whole but while still me it's unique flavor exactly so you know with that embracing our own culture we're able to engage people a little bit more we're not coming in as aliens or

outside people trying to occupy something that we don't know about I'm Chicago born and raised so I know all the great spots as far as where to get a great beer I look great you know bars where we can do meet upset so what we do is that we want to indoctrinate the culture as much as hot as much as possible when it comes to abster damn and those embassies within those

particular cities or countries so do you meet monthly or is it how do the meetups working and where do you where do you meet it that's a great question uh when it comes to absa damn Chicago in particular we do monthly and what we want to do is start increasing the frequency of those meetups I just wanted to test our market to see if there was interest we launched back in March at

the creative Chicago Expo at the cultural center and we had some great response from that we had about 60 people sign up to be advocates and support after them and then we started our meetup group which is after damn meetup.com I hope I got that right I'm a little adjusting that in the in the show notes great and and then we have right now we currently have about forty seven

people in the meetup right now so roughly we have over a hundred advocates right now for supporting after damn Chicago and and it's a mission cool now one of the things we talked about earlier was that there's a project that's coming out of abstraction hago the local UX and I thought it was kind of interesting how you would be having a an actual physical product coming out of

the community how does that work and what what what exactly is that product as Braden and just the BACtrack real briefly uh you know pretty much what after damn what we what we do is that not only are we an organization of people that develop things or in our spare time or whenever we have a moment within our regular nine-to-five but we want to

against encourage people to constantly develop and create great things regardless of what their time is so for an example best example before i go into local lux is my clean you know he created lumens chemistry if you're familiar with that ipad game and that was something of that was created externally up after damn but it was powered by the ingenuity and the

creativity inside of the the apps Adama ecosystem so it's kind of like we represent our our companies through after them if you go to local Lux app com which is the company if you scroll down to the bottom you'll see a URL this is powered by abster damn and that's the thing that I want to continue to push through out any projects that I get behind because not only am I

representing myself but I'm also representing after day on their regards to work release now just to get into local lux well that particular project is something that's been in the making since late last year is a hyper local marketplace for independent makers so if you for instance love to make handbags I don't know why but this for an example but y'all carry stuff yeah that's only

gonna do so much right where book bags are laptop bags and and your independent manufacturer and you just are you want to cast a wider net you want to be able to get your product out there yes we have things that that currently exist in the marketplace we have etsy we have other independent markets we have another one on square market just released about a month and a half ago

but it's not really a hyperlocal experience and that's where I feel that there's an absence because from a local perspective I feel we have a social obligation to not only the global community but also your own backyard you want to make sure that money is flowing throughout your local economy and propping it up because once you spend on dollar at walmart you don't really know

where that money is actually going at the end of the day and you know facts are there is that every dollar is spent at a big box corporation 45 45 cents of that goes to you know corporate jets or you know they're all kinds of stuff exactly it's not going to the manufacturer the Creator the maker exactly but if you look at the numbers you will actually be able to see if you

support your local economy through buying a local produce from farmers markets and you see that that money actually that dollar is extended out able to have better communities you ever have you could have better schools better policing better environments for children and overall have a better family environment so that's my advocacy with local looks and you know we're

accepting people to come on out and be alpha testers we have about 100 people right now and it's just a great experience we're just one more thing we are in the middle of crowdfunding contest and we have about 17 days left and we're actually in first place you have while you're about 30 about thirty percent funded right now and we're just smoking the competition right now so you

know if anybody would you know love to assist you can definitely go to our website local luxe app calm and follow the prompts as far as being able to pledge I can't promise that this is going to be deployed before then but I deployed that's i'm a developer hahaha but publish this is but but i'll try and get a link out but the young the thing that interested me about that is when i

talked to mike lee that it was focused on that app stirred am was a business that was aware of the community that it was in and and there was the study that was done by the University of Amsterdam where Helsinki sorry for whoever is goes to those I apologize to any alumni of either one of those institutions if I got it wrong but that uh that there were studies about how these technical can

these can support and prop up their local community their local businesses is that kind of where the idea for local luxe came from is saying okay we'll focus on our own regional community and that was kind of the instigator and and how how does it work with apps Travis is this a product that is developed underneath the app stirred am brand or how does that work I do many questions

there's yeah is the first question uh essentially the what we want to do with after dam is we want to say weary I would stay in charge but we have a responsibility to support uh you know our own local we can only reach out so far uh when it comes to your own backyard you are the severe you are to protect their you are the advocate for where you live so before that report

actually even came out uh you know I was already on that advocacy coming from my business program because we're very strong supporters of being community leaders are the business program that I was a part of we actually make it a creed that we want to have a thousand community leaders five 2017 and with that I kind of put myself in a position to say hey not only do I you know wants

to become a a an aspiring serial entrepreneur also of a great successful business but I also want to support my community at the same time so during my my research you know I wanted to be able to say hey this is a great company now you know that is you know capitalistic you know your business you have to breathe money but you know where that money is going is going to the advocacy

of supporting our own City supporting our own state and supporting the underdogs because we don't get much notoriety or press when it comes to people that we represent us in the basements of their homes are doing one to handmade items or you know that person that's really you know just can only do it in their spare time we want to be able to give them a voice and give

them a platform to actually say hey here's a smartphone app that people can embrace and see what you're offering and pay for it and and and get that experience of the second question is well that can be but yeah it was that you're launching this product and it's in it's powered by abstinent elite the the trademark of apps turn em or do you work with other F stammers to develop

the product how how did that work a great question how this pretty much works is that since I'm a part of action since I'm the Ambassador o / member i would like to call myself a member and you know no type of hierarchy exists as far as I'm concerned but what I do is that we incorporate members to help out with the project for instance if I had a challenge ahead of me that required some

type of net or some type of all objective-c things of that nature I would put a beacon out to our after damn community and have someone chime in and help me with that challenge and move it on from there it just creates a holistic point of view we want to be able to if I'm happy if I have a marketing question or if I have a technological question or if I just have a SEO question we have a

thriving community of these experts that's able to chime in and we can talk via Skype or email whatever the case so when I say it's powered by accident thats exactly what it is so it's like it in that respect it's acting kind of like a um a trusted network almost like I want to say like I like a trade group where everybody is in the same industry and they can help each other and quite

can things like that exactly exactly my point yep well thank you very much for taking the time to saddam fear i really appreciate it thank you and I appreciate it i'm looking forward to you tastic the interview everything else that you guys going out and we'll be in touch soon about the upcoming events that we got going on great great I'll try to get

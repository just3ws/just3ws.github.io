hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here with ash Dryden who is been involved in the past with Drupal conf but now she's involved with several other conferences in the PHP and Ruby world hi ash thanks for taking the time to sit down yeah so so you were involved with the Drupal conf in the past and other conferences in the PHP in Ruby world and also you've had some interesting thoughts on Twitter

about diversity and how we can have a more diverse attendance and participation in our conferences but let's start with the with the the conferences how did you get involved with triple conf in that back in the day um well I've been pretty involved with in the Drupal world for probably the past five six seven years and I started out organizing more local camp style

oven so I did your camp Wisconsin and I got to know a lot of the people that are on the drupal association and were the people that put on the drupal cons and they did one in Chicago and I'm local ish out in Madison Wisconsin um so it seemed like a really good fit I've been organizing conferences for a long time I work a lot in the community so I was really happy to be a part of that I

organized the day stage for Triple Crown Chicago cool and but you said you've been involved with some other conferences recently yep I did this past year I did quite a few actually the two bigger ones were I helped out with Madison Ruby which is a ruby conference it's more regional it's a really great conference if you ever get a chance and also the Midwest developer summit which

brought together a bunch of people from all over the world to one place to kind of work on all of the initiatives in the drill community so what what kind of got you into you wanted to be involved with the conference's did you just like to be in conferences or did you did you have the organizational bug before that's yeah um well i started out organizing bar camps and he i started out

organizing bar camps in milwaukee okay what's a bar camp a bar camp okay are you familiar with the idea of foo camps boot camps um well it's not so much me it'sit's yeah it is or so okay so boot camps are kind of O'Reilly's invite-only unconference style event where they bring people from the top levels of everywhere in the industry together to kind of physically camp what also talked

about things are passionate about and what they're doing to further or whatever their goals are and barcamp is kind of the community level version of that so it's the idea that you have a wealth of information in your community so instead of paying a bunch money to go to a conference to basically sit in a room and listen to somebody speak who claims to be an expert you can go to a

conference and talk about what you're really passionate about and meet other people that are like you that are passionate about kind of things that you like so that would be kind of comparable to Ted and TEDx kinda um it's been going out a little bit longer than that I think it's similar ish blood lectures yeah yeah but it's much more like community driven like the the schedule

isn't set until you get there everybody and brights on a post it note and puts up on the board what they're going to talk about and then you just go to whatever you're interested in one of the driving factors of barcamp is a sink called the law of two feet which is the idea that if you're not getting or giving value where you are then get up and move in to somewhere that you can so

that's kind of where that idea was pioneered yeah the unconference rule yes mmm okay um so uh uh on Twitter you'd been talking about about trying to talk to other people who run conferences about how they can reach out to two other more diverse groups I mean there's been complaints that's most conferences and it's a pretty simple observation is that most conferences are male youngish

white but you were looking at how you can reach out to women other minorities so what was the conic actually thinking about that and what what is uh what is the advice ensure you're looking at sharing sure so I'm a woman and technology com and i've been in technology in one form or another for the past 12 or 13 years and I've run into a lot of obstacles just

specifically because my gender and that was really frustrating to me and over the past few years I've learned a lot more about this idea of social justice which is that society isn't equal for all people there are certain people who because of the because of the person they were born as whether they are white or straight or able that's big one or if they are born into an english-speaking

country that's a big one in tech that they have extra opportunities that other people don't have so social justice kind of gives us the tools to be able to start writing that imbalance so that's something that I'm really passionate about and I saw that there is a big disconnect between the way that the tech world operates and the way that it should actually operate so I wanted to

start applying the ideas of social justice to the tech community because we're overwhelmingly white male straight I wanted to kind of change that so I'm talking to conference organizers and people who attend conferences or who organized groups that are trying to help people get into technology to incentivize or give them given the tools and education to be able to make the

right decisions about how they can make it more accessible to all people yes sir do you have any examples of good conferences that that you've seen that seem to be doing a good job of reaching out you to non-traditional Sarah booth I've gotcha i'm drawn of like of the word but but but reaching out you more in broader groups of people is there been any conferences that kind of stand

out for you um there are quite a lot I think that farmhouse comp is probably one of the bigger examples it's a conference that's Ron in hollywood california and it's not specifically tech but the vast majority of people who attend are in tech and it's got a 50-50 % breakdown men and women so that's a big deal that almost never happens and so rare to see

more than one woman on a speaker list yeah and I thought it was kind of interesting that you even pointed out that it's it's cultural things like even just different languages mm-hmm that could be for bidding for somebody from speaking at a conference it might not feel I'm just trying to say that even participating in the conference might be I've had good friends who were great

developers but they would shy away from probably well they would shy away from any time I I know there's there's some that I've known in the past you've tried away from any time they've it had to present or do anything where they'd stand up not just because of shyness or anything but because they were afraid of getting up and forgetting words we're not being able to say the thing in there

in English and yeah that there could be I don't know how you would even try to approach that's making people more comfortable in that for that kind of fear well it's interesting one of the the major things that I've noticed and develops majority of the tech world is very very english-centric and for the most part extremely American centric so a lot of the bigger conferences happen

in the United States which makes it a problem for people in the rest of the world to get in especially considering the way that our immigration and TSA and all that kind of work I've heard people getting stuck in you know in Canada trying to get in you know they paid all this money to fly from like Australia and have to go back so that right there is a problem but also I mean we have

conferences that are in use fear Eastern Europe in countries that English is not the dominant language but the conference is specifically in English because the vast majority of high-level programmers and most people know do speak English so it works out in their favor that's great but for a lot of the people who don't speak english as a first language it's extremely intimidating it's hard a lot

of people assume that you're not intelligent or you're not listening to if you can't get your ideas across well enough in English and I mean this isn't just in person it's also i mean if you look at on github if somebody wants to do a pull request for whatever your project is and they can't adequate adequately explained in English what they're trying to do there's a huge

barrier there people are less likely to you know take that pull request or to spend time on working with the person if they can't communicate with them effectively right yeah it's unfortunates it's the tower of Babylon problem really the the other thing is it's about working with like I interviewed James Gray the third James Gray James Gray with three eyes okay nobody was

interesting that he was a wheelchair-bound hmm and he talked about how there has been improvement in conferences in most larger conferences if they're that they usually know who they're inviting and they knew who they're bringing in and they're usually at larger venues that can support people who are wheelchair bound or have special needs but it's it's a smaller

conferences it's the it's the user groups that have a little bit more trouble I mean is it just about being aware and just kind of paying attention and trying to look and because how how could somebody who who's running a smaller conference know that there's a like I've been involved with a small regional conference and I wouldn't even know to how to know here that there are

people out there in my area that could benefit from letting them know that we're I guess it's just generally letting people know the wheelchair accessible because i was sure what the question i was trying to get it was how can i know that there's people that I'm letting letting out or letting down in my community and being able to ensure that I've taken steps to try to address

share those sure so the best way to go about it is to always assume that there are people out there that you need to basically give extra help to attend so always is that you're going to have somebody who you know has a physical disability that it makes it difficult for them to get upstairs or to push buttons to open elevator it's those kinds of things um I

wouldn't wait until somebody who has this physical disability attends our tries to come to your group group or your conference go out of your way ahead of time to make sure that the venue that you're selecting does make it easy for people who have physical disabilities but it's it's other kinds of disabilities as well I mean like I'm hard of hearing there are a lot of

conferences that I I have a hard time hearing what the speaker is saying because it's either way too loud or the person is speaking way to quietly there are a lot of people who need to have somebody who signs come with them or people who are sight impaired who need to have another person come with them to basically help them get around then it's plan larger venues where you're talking

about people having book bags and Isles and I mean all of these kinds of things kind of create issues so it's educating yourself as to the kinds of things that people have to deal with basically to have basically to attend your event so and that applies to every single group that's out there you don't want to see anybody getting harassed or anybody having a hard time physically getting

around or finding the venue those kinds of things so just the tape sake take some time get to know the different groups and try and figure out what you can do to make it easier for them basically and you know about the harassment there's there's been talk about adding like statements of codes of conduct and things like that have those helped are they more just being aware

and making people think about in making a conscious statement so codes of conduct and anti-harassment policies are a big thing that we can do to not necessarily stop the harassment from going on but it gives its give it gives us a tool to be able to act when something when something like that happens so it's kind of twofold one it tells people who have been

rest in the past or a worried about being harassed or worse that the conference organizers take it seriously that they have an action plan that they know what to do and also when somebody does violate the policy it basically gives you a written document to say look when you signed up for the conference you have you had to read this to buy your ticket these are the things that

you did that we're not allowed and it's not okay and for this reason we're kicking you out of the conference or you're not want to come back depending on how bad the offense was so kind of gives you protection against them saying why didn't know that I couldn't do that or you know you know a lot of the excuses that people give a really bad so it kind of gives you a tool to handle

the situation appropriately yeah and it it's kind of makes me think about you know we have laws and they're they're not necessarily going to stop people from doing the bad things but what they do do the bad things it's pretty clear what they are and we have you know we can then take further action so it kind of makes sense to me to have the code of conduct is there anything else that you

maybe think that there might be something because it is you may have noticed I am also a while I'm a straight white you wouldn't have noticed that but I'm a straight white male uh is there anything else said when I'm approaching my community from somebody that that I should that I should think about something that's maybe a way i can I can maybe empathize better or or be able to

approach different groups that that well I might not otherwise understand their your experiences sure um my my biggest recommendation is to talk to your friends I mean a really good way to find out that the issues that people face trying to attend events or the things that they worry about when they go to attend events is to talk to people that you know you know is these are things

that do happen to people and it's unfortunate and how do we stop it and talking to people in your community is a great way to kind of figure out and get input from them about what would make them feel safe will make them feel welcome and accepted that's a really big thing if you I mean and the community has changed a lot over the past 10 years so

it used to be very common that as a woman going to a conference that was the only woman in the room so that makes you feel uncomfortable because you are the one of a group and it's it's it's just very intimidating and now it's changed a lot where they're a lot more or less and that's really awesome and I love seeing that but the problems have kind of amplified and I don't know if that's

because we hear about it more because people are talking about it more which is awesome or if because it's happening more frequently it's hard to tell so talking to people that faces kinds of issues reaching out to people that you don't know or people that you know have stopped attending certain conferences and finding out why is a really great reason there's tons of resources online

the geek feminism wiki is a big one there are quite a few tumblrs that basically list events that happened and what happened and why that shouldn't have happened and there are quite a lot of us that are open and willing to talk to people about the ways that they can change the way their conference phrases things or the way that they deal with certain situations to make it more open

and welcome and inviting for everybody so more talk is it's getting to communicate you know I I see talked because it's it's a nice short word but it's about communicating and getting to the more you learn the more you know you know GI Joe is good for one thing about talking to people that you know about these issues it's a lot easier to empathize i think a lot of people have a

hard time empathizing with somebody that they don't know very well so if you have you know a friend who's a person of color or woman or somebody with physical or mental disabilities and you ask them about these issues you kind of care more right away because it's somebody that you care about you don't want to see treated that way yeah so the empathy thing is a big deal i I had a friend who

I was helping get into a position who was he was gay and he was concerned about you know he's like can you tell me about this company are they going to be you know it's and I I reassured them they were an excellent company and the people there were good people not not going to give him a bit a hard time for his life or judging um yeah it's it's and that caught me kind of off

guard I didn't even think about that being yeah you know so yeah it's it's when you get to go out and talk to people and see from other people's positions what what they what they're experiencing and what they're afraid of mm-hmm and that's how you learn to empathize with those things yeah and I mean a big thing too is when you see something happening that's not okay say

something like I can't tell you how many times I've been cornered by people who say horrible things to me and people just stand by and watch in horror like stand up and say something if somebody is getting you know beaten on the street are you gonna stand there and watch it's basically the same thing and that scares a lot of people out of our industry I mean we have the statistic on women

leave in the industry within ten years sixty percent that leave careers in tech because of the harassment because of the way that they're treated specifically because of their gender and that's a really hard thing to deal with and I don't think that people necessarily appreciate how hard it is to be a marginalized group in a community that's overwhelmingly one demographic so

definitely learnt empathize a little bit better stand up for people when you see something's going down that's wrong and educate yourself alright well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me that's some good advice thanks thank you

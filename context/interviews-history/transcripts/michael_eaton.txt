hi it's mike with you tastic again I'm sitting down with Michael Keaton and we're going to be talking about Kalamazoo X the conference that he's been running for the we've been co organizing it's very least for the last five years hi Michael can you uh thanks for taking the time to sit down can you tell me a little bit about what is Kalamazoo X and and how it got started

yeah thanks for having me Kalamazoo x is a it's we've started billing it as the non technology technology conference really what it boils that onto is it's all about soft skills a few years ago the user group i'm part of in kalamazoo michigan was kicking around putting on a conference but we didn't want to have just another day at net or co camp we wanted to do something different and a

good friend of mine josh holmes I'm suggested that we you know think about something like soft skills or you know a pitch like two or three things and soft skills really kind of jumped out we all noticed a distinct lack of soft skills talks and conferences and and but it's important that people have the specially developers who are typically bad at the soft skills portion of things so what I

have a conference like that what what is soft skills in in this context so soft skills we do everything from a ma so the i guess the original vision was things like design architecture you know user experience but it's turned its kind of turned over the last couple years into more of you know a lot of interpersonal communications a lot of things like that you know how to be a better person

that's what a lot of it comes down to you know someone described the conference this year as a profane set of ted talks so we you know we try to get these these we limit it's a single track it's 30 minutes per talk and i did that for a couple reasons the first year we had a plan we were going to do a normal multitrack conference you know five tracks you know however many talks that

is right and a few weeks out we just didn't have a lot of attendees and I panicked I totally freaked out in fact I reached out to really good friends of mine one of them big jim holmes who helps run code mash and i always establish one of the speakers for the first year and I was panicked I'm like I don't know what to do and it was literally a last minute

decision to make it a single track conference probably two weeks out I emailed the speaker saying okay instead of an hour you guys yeah 30 minutes well in fact the first year it was 20 minute talks and the speakers every all but one one of them just couldn't justify you know a long drive to do a 20-minute talk but but all the other speakers i think we had 14 or 15 talks the first year

they'll jumped at the chance because 20 minutes means you have to be on and they all worried it was it was amazing but you know that first year we did have some some work tech you know some technical centric talks not that super hardcore no one we've had two people show code and was only snippets of code otherwise it is very it's very touchy feely topics you know we the freedom

toxin leadership and the types of things and that's what I look for in fact we don't actually do an open call for speakers i hand-picked the speakers i personally invite every one of them and what i look for our keynote quality talk someone that can get up on stage for 4 30 minutes and nail it right and you know there are a lot of great speakers out there but there are even fewer they

can do that and that's what I look for and we've had some amazing talks and it's there have been some what I've even called some of the talks life-changing I mean have been just you know kind of like wow what was that because some of the speakers in fact anymore there are some speakers i will just approach and I will just say I I don't care what you talk about just fit fit within the

overall framework of the of the conference yeah which is you're such a soft skills he had 20 minutes here's your theme go yep yep and you know we have been at 30 minutes for the last couple years and it's been been just amazing because most of them will just get up there and just nail we've have had some people you know because you're not on all the

time and we have had some talks you know not go as well as they could have but you know for the most part you get someone like Ali on bear Singh I've never seen him not beyond yeah and his talks are the ones that to me they always seem to Lee as a way of talking to me during his talks and some of them have to spend like wow I needed that talk at that moment yeah he presented at

SCA and that was the overall just the vibe of his put on Twitter his post talk just people being utterly floored by by the emotional and I think that's something that's one of these conferences I just wonder you know your record you mentioned earlier that you recording some of them but i think the in-person experience is very different from the recorded is this something that

you've maybe felt as well that's you know hearing these people speak live it's a much more personal venue they can kind of address you directly in an impact you and you get a more of an emotional absolutely the i actually when i introduced because I I kind of MC the day and I up and I'll introduce each of the speakers and I always say it's a very selfish event for me because these

are people i want to see is these are and most of them are really good friend you know Leon and Joe O'Brien and Jim homes and and you know just I can't name them all but there have been some amazing speakers and it's just such a joy to sit there and just let them do their thing right it's amazing and I did you know we have had people say well just release all the videos this was the

first year we actually were able to record them all we had logistical issues in the previous years that just didn't work out recording a conference even if a single track is still hard and this year we we we came close and there were still some issues but you know part of my thing is I want people to show up because it is such a different experience you know the audience is so

much more in tune with what's going on and it's you know you have to you have to be there I mean yeah we have released some videos they're out on vimeo which can be reached through our website kalamazoo xorg and we're going to release more but in the end you know I'm doing this to help drive people to come next year because I you know next year is going to be year 5 and you know this

year was as perfect as it could have been and next year we're going to try to top it and we've got some got a couple speakers lined up in fact I've been soliciting some input from some past attendees just to ask them you know what have we done wrong what have we done right what do you want to see and it's been it's been just a blast it's like it's a great conference the people that

have been they've come to the conference get it and and they're you know people have said it's it's one of their favorite conferences to come to its relatively small and it is in Kalamazoo Michigan which is kind of out of the way but you know what we've had people come from Chicago we've had people come from as far away as louisville and you know we've flown speakers in from Colorado we

had at we flew a speaker from Colorado but we have had people drive we had people fly in from different places to come to the conference and now it seems to me like I'm starting to see kind of a little bit of a theme with community conferences it's starting to evolve with more of this on it like you said soft content but kind of contrasting that too hard tech conference some people say oh

I go to a conference I want to hear about the latest and greatest frameworks and techniques and all that stuff but some going to a conference like like what you described in Kalamazoo X and then the certain talks that happen even at Windy City rails with Steve collab Nick talking about philosophy for software development and then Leon at SC na talking about that his um keeping the

software weird and then what you're talking about it it Kalamazoo it almost feels like there's starting to be a little bit of a trend that people are you know we get enough tuck at work and we get enough tech through normal means but getting that human interaction getting motivated in a positive way not just hey rah rah rah but like trying to reach to an emotional

core for why we do what we do and why we're passionate about it seemed I mean is that have you even ever anybody complained about hey why is it a more like latest greatest hacker from Microsoft or yeah our after event survey we get that a lot and I stress about it I I really do I stress about that in fact this the email I sent out to a couple people today saying you know

should we you know what should we change the focus so let me just take a quick step back so the name Kalamazoo X conference was originally our code name we honestly couldn't think of a good name you know calling it the Kalamazoo soft skills conference yes didn't work and so we kept calling it in our emails to Kalamazoo X conference and so the first year we decided you know what

let's go with it and we could be we could be geeks and say you know your x equals soft skills and maybe next to your X will equal whatever but the soft skills thing just kind of stuck and I do get that from people that you know hey why don't you bring in some tech talks and the funny thing is the years that I've tried to bring in some tech talks they have been the lower rated talks of

the day people have preferred the the full on soft skill stocks versus you know things a designer should know or things a developer should though even though that the talks were great they just didn't represent eight with the audience like the soft skills once lit that's the thing with it with the soft skills is it doesn't matter whether your microsoft developer re or a web

developer or a mobile developer at all or developer at all yeah exactly you can just be a person and we actually had we actually had people this this year say the next year they're going to bring their spouses we're not that we're not adept and we Kalamazoo's a college town so we do try to bring get in some students to and you know my wife every year my kids have been there I

mean you know it's one of those things where it's what and that's where we're trying to struggle a little bit with you know calling it the no technology technology conference because anybody can come and that's kind of the angle we're going to start shooting for is you know what doesn't matter what field you're in you can learn from this I mean seriously you listen to a leon talk as

you talk or is going gonzo talk or any of them even if there's a little bit of tech in it you're going to get something out of it you know Joe Brian's people patterns everybody could get something out of that I don't care what field you're in you know Tim Wingfield at a talk this year on your career as yours you know we had Elizabeth narramore do one on dealing with difficult people

these are not these are not just uh for developers at all yeah it's so it's like kind of a developer maybe bend or theme for the day but any any any person could come to this conference and and still get some value out of it right and i think you know we try to think of it that way because we are debs right the first year of marketing the first couple years of our qatan was word of mouth

through twitter and that was who were we marketing to our friends on twitter who were almost all devs you know this year were you know I'm trying to make a little little more of it on on facebook and try to use people pulled in that way to see what it's about we've got the videos that have been released trying to think we've you know we've got Elizabeth's out there Leon's Tim's none

of them are like hard core tech so you know I would certainly recommend anybody watch those even Jamie Justin Searles talks about the mythical teen month which is a little geeky a little more more technical but the still i mean it's it's all good soft skills people related communication type stuff that everyone can use okay all right well um thank you very much for taking the time to sit

down and talk about kalamazoo x sounds like it's really exciting conference and I will have it i'll be sure to post this before before the the conference okay thank you very much

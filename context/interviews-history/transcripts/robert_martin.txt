hi i'm mike with you tastic i'm here again at SEMA I'm sitting down with the inimitable Uncle Bob Martin it should might know that he's reading these books were created the solid principles and written the clink odor which was a very well received book on understanding how to write and design software well and now you're doing a series of videos called the clean coder link odors clean

coders excuse me and I need any of your bracelet you reach out to and try to teach in a variety which you speak you right you you blog yes and I even tweet once or twice but so you're trying to teach in these concepts in a broad spectrum and and I know you've gone and spoken in user groups as well so you you you had a lot of me try to cover yeah yeah so what does that like him what is

drawing me to create the clean coders Oh what is it why it keeps me busy I fly all over the bag on place give talks and yell at people and encourage them to be professional and talk about solid principles and techniques and so on I love to be creative it's something that thrills me when I can make something from nothing and so I make articles and books make software and I make videos

now um I got into the videos because there was obviously this new way to communicate right I had the web it gives us this way of doing doing videos and the tools for creating videos have gotten so incredibly powerful then I thought one day you know I should just make a different kind of video not not the typical kind of screencast but instead a scripted produced edited video

and I taught myself all the tools and I got bought some cameras and I actually put first two I did it threw away and then finally got into the zone and produced a video that I thought was really good encouraged my son to work with me to put together a website clean coders calm and we put the videos up on that website and we've been selling like hotcakes Frank like yeah they're they're

doing very well it's just another creative outlet just another way for me to spread my message around the world so so it's not just about worried that it's not just a message only a lot of it is creative that you can kind of fun with it you can do because she died campus don't you do a little campy things so but it but it's it's one of the things though that I think is interesting about

it and it's what kind of job me to create this you tastic as well is that it takes what a lot of people only deliver through Twitter or a written word which me try and it really depends on the interpretation video of the reader whereas when you do a video and that's one of the drivers for this whole series is be able to see and hear and watch the bodies laying bodies

motion-based links out of the boys yet and they're talking it's a very wide bandwidth communications medium that you there's a whole bunch of different ways to communicate ideas and the more different ways you use to communicate ideas more the ideas get across yeah alright so screencast is fairly one-dimensional a blog is pretty one-dimensional but video has just got

millions of different ways that you can present cool ideas yeah so you can but you also get a better idea of that of that person right well there's definitely personality involve course that's been my intent all along is to Bruce these videos that are dripping with personality yeah well and that you are well known for your speaking being very robust and

animated or something animated hi i have pity da camera operator then had to try to attract you on stage as i tries to take pictures of you nice folks yes to drive them completely insane haha i have a series of pictures that were just blurs that's that's all they were um but you know another goal of this video series is to help people that are learning how to speak as well so we

talked about that we're focused on user group speakers so people I've had people like Corey means I interviewed him and he said that he actually and I got to say this during the pre-interview but it just occurred to me is that he said that he studied the way you present in the way you engage in audience is that something that is always been in your personality or is that something that

over now I was born with that and I'm not exactly sure why but from you know age 5 I've never been afraid of audiences I like to engage them I do better with audiences that i can use individuals right probably one of my pathologies but yeah it's just something that I have this innate love of getting on stage and entertaining a big lot of people yeah yeah and that's when you say

entertaining about when i enter v4 unless he was talking about when you get up you only have a certain amount of time yep and you have to figure out a way to get a message through to the people in the audience who might have been there for several hours and they're tired and kind of checking out a little bit but get waking them up get them and maybe you get one or two points across

that leads them to go off and more research is that been kind of similar to what your method is you want to introduce a few concepts there's there's a few major points that you want to make and you want to make it in a way that that keeps everybody engaged and everyone watching and interested in absorb there's a song I can't remember the artist right now but the one of the

words in the song is out there up there on the stage every ounce of energy you try to give away is that that is that Abba song I think it's not oh no no no no it's I know well I'll do that now you know it's all fine that hits a Seger song and and and there's a lot of accuracy on stage it's all about energy and try to put as much energy out as you can to engage the audience and deliver

the message that you're trying to get in you alluded to you about it's sometimes easier to talk to an audience and this sometimes to talk to an individual I'll admit and one of the things that also don't need to do this is that I in trouble engaging people directly but my creating a format of it was easier for me to approach something yes these are the things I want to talk about it and

learn more about but by not just doing it for myself I'm able to show a lot of people it comes that's a greedy that's uh but it was actually you're not the first person to describe that putting on a persona for an audience sometimes as suffered of authors where we attended more turn to the inside of our head and then we come to these conferences and speaker and share and we have to kind of

put on a mask so to speak yeah I suppose so a mask or something there it's a safe format I can get up on stage and I know exactly what to do I know I can engage the crowd and there's they're all there to listen to me it's a safe form and it's a lot like a number yeah bartenders very safe relationship to have with something because they're going to love

you yes especially if you feel their bill beer up lovely or any hot just make sure that beers with enough handed their game 11 yeah same same thing with being on stages make sure you fill it all that nestled up well thank you very much for taking the time you're welcome you should

hi I'm here with a very high tower from Chicago Ruby also the lead organizer for windy city rails conference but we're going to be talking about it's a lot Chicago Ruby right now I ray can you tell us a little bit about saw Chicago Ruby and what kind of meetings you have well sure Oh about Chicago will be well Chicago Ruby is a user group our motto is when smart people challenge each

other to grow great things happen so we get together and we share ideas we have three events every month three meetings each month one downtown that got word sponsors every month I second one a hat night downtown that is typically sponsored by enova financial and in the western suburbs and the Elmer's the forest group gives us a space there when we meet on the third saturday of every

movie so you have three meetings every month what kind of what kind of a number she usually what kind of audience you should be like how many up to bring designers developers more people with rails for people yeah we we've done surveys to determine who comes out to our meetings we've got really four groups developers designers entrepreneurs and investors roughly

ninety percent self-select its developers forty percent designers you see there's some overlap you draw a Venn diagram yeah and then soldiers yeah Deb's and designers and then entrepreneurs and investors together make up about five percent of the people who identify in one of those four groups now that's that's really interesting that you have people coming out that

identify themselves as entrepreneurs investors me know you mean like actual people that aren't doing Ruby dad that are coming out to meet Ruby done yeah there are a handful of people you know at every meeting we get a few people who come out and say hey I'm looking for deaths or designers I've got this idea and I want to build a team to do this so we get a few people coming out who want

to meet some people to do that but mostly because of the content of our meetings the lion's share of the people that are meetings are developers or designers right because that that's who we we want to please you know when we say what's much your audience that's our Islands that's a primary audience yeah and so the other people are there

because they're attracted by the primary audience yes in ticket that's a interesting enough dynamic um now a typical meeting is it usually a presentation format or do you do hands-on labs or it depends it depends on the downtown meetings are always there's a presentation followed by QA followed by a visit to navarre sorry engage in adult beverages in France

storm so that's what we do downtown that's on the first Tuesday of every month we max out at 100 on the RSVPs there also we typically get about 50 sometimes we'll get 70 80 and there depending on the time have you ever had a meeting where if you're max honored whenever she did that yeah yeah Oh what we find is we've gone beyond the 100 in RSVPs but if it's a really nice day

outside yeah you might get a 120 RSVPs but a bunch of people go to the beach because yea the a on building which isn't too far from the lake yeah some people on the way to meeting I imagine some people just hop on the bikes and go boom yeah like you never know yeah yeah yeah but you know with its it's cool you know if we have to live balance lives and all that stuff so it's it's it's

funny but you know we find that when we get 100 RSVPs typically we'll have about 70 or 80 at the meeting right but our average at the downtown meetings is probably about 50 our hat nights just recently we had a hat night last week that have 50 plus I don't know what the exact number was there but I know was 150 now out in these suburbs will get anywhere from five to twenty somewhere

in there because that's a saturday morning right yeah that's what I'm gonna ask you about is yeah is your schedule because you have a unique dynamic you're not just doing one group it's like a like a chain of yes the system of groups that you have the heck nights yes you have the downtown meetings yes also have no personal right well you coordinate goes and do you have

a team of people that you oh yes we absolutely have a team if you go to our github repo and get em done / Chicago bleep in here you'll see a repo when they're not rape or directory within our repo how chicago Ruby words oh and then there's the organization of having building all right I'm not definitely linked to that yeah yes so I would take a look at that and that that evolved

over time we actually started off in aylmer we started off a franklin park we were five guys meeting in the library and franklin park that became the organizing and when i became organized as i'm not going to do about myself and what other people worked with me one of the other guys in that realm is meant to lead oh all right now yessum as became an organizer then Victor hung will Chung

there's a pie if you go to Chicago to New York we maintain a list of organizer alums p been part of the organizer team over time oh wow and so the way we manage to three groups is well the hanford site Jenny Hendry cannot to get me at one meeting said hey great we should do a class and I said yeah Jenny you should organize so that's how Jenni became an organized right you know sasha

is something people came to work with you you came down like some support and help too oh yeah yeah all the support of the world and we yeah because they great ideas geometric I don't hack nights debut take a kiss one day except a mission coating don't say okay day living running day jutsu was an organizer Chicago Ruby for a couple of years and he brought a lot of good ideas

to us into Windy City rails as you want yeah so you know having your kind of a veteran in the fuel our users well if somebody is looking to start off a user group now he's running kind of sage wisdom you might your neck sage Wiz yeah how about some just random stuff on the top of my head doesn't matter you know what is worked well for us one of the first things that we did when when I

first became a ganar was the first thing I want to do is make sure we have consistent side because we want people to know that they can put on the calendar is your power will be moving in here in advance they won't necessarily know the topic we won't know the time but we'll know the date the time in the place so with that consistency everybody can plan around it

and then once you have that then you you want to get good speakers and the speakers really draw people in you want a location that's accessible one of the problems we had when I first became hardwired pay five dollars of these are meeting to pay for the library room oh yes yeah your mind all that work yeah for this library in the western suburbs we were fortunate that lead affairs and

owns a million elmhurst had a place for us to meet these Lee said to us hey you can meet in the basement of my building it's a great spot it's like a clubhouse like them remember the our gang comedies like it yeah it's like ah ha ha and you know least set aside but no other girl sir oh yeah we haven't yet we are very friendly to women and you know black people yes very friendly across and you

know just the Ruby community in general is very open to people I thought you know I was no no immediately accepted when I didn't know anybody you know that you know that for me yeah your expenditure groups and yes not knowing anybody yeah but initially most groups are pretty welcoming is if people are willing to get together to spend their time to talk about it's always one more

person to talk to yes yes okay yes ah thank you very much right thank you from Chicago Ruby thank you very much for talking thank you much thank you for having

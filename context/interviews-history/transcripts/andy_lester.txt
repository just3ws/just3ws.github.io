hi I'm Mike I'm with you tastic here at Chicago web com I'm sitting down with Amy luster yeah you might have used some of his tools on dub dub dub mechanize or ack he's also formerly ran the chicago perl mongers out of the suburbs he's written quite a bit about job hunting and how to be a good citizen inside of a the open source community thank you for sitting down with me Andy I can you tell

me a little bit about what your experience has been working with a canned mechanized and all the other tools that you've created and kind of put out there sure my most of what I do is like most a lot of open source projects is scratching an itch something like ACK scratch the itch of me needing to search through a code base that was both with multiple different languages

together and I needed an easy way to filter out certain languages i scratch that itch and it grew from there something like DUP DUP DUP mechanized the perl module started from we needed a way to do automated testing of web pages make sure that logins worked and didn't work in the proper way found an existing module fork that off and brew that but what's great about that about that model

is once you start the original edge and once you talk about it and once you start talking about hey here's something that I've done and a lot of people I don't then talk about their projects enough when other people start to use it it the role of me is a maintainer has will in most of my projects has gone from the original perator to shepherd of the ongoing maintenance so something

like ack people add features or mechanize i probably written maybe a third of mechanized and the other two-thirds are all things that have come from the community so it's more of the vision you've got more of like a product manager at a certain point at some point yet I do and part of that also comes to where you need to hand them off to other

people so for instance mechanized I've handed off because I've not been able to do the maintenance on it that I need to do right at the time into it and there are other people who have those have the skill have the time and so now that's going to be part of the Corporal lwp core modules so she's actually going to be part of pearl itself out of well but not of pearl but of the lwp which is

pretty common okay I'm most efficacious Jen doesn't live yeah yeah it's one of his front of the standard libraries and so that kind of ongoing maintenance you can pass off I said hey you know what I'm not able to put all the time into it it also there were issues that I was not qualified to deal with I I'm horrible internationalization I don't understand the issues that that go into dealing

with all the different kinds of characters that's until when I handed that off to Jesse Vincent who does a lot of work across multiple characters as I mean he does a lot of stuff with Asian languages i know i said okay he's he's going to know how to deal with this i handed it off to him so it is product like project management or product management and it's and I try not to be

you know too in some extent I have to be the benevolent dictator but I also have to bring people in I have to encourage other people to contribute so it's not just not just about product it's about encouraging fostering a sense of you that you're bringing something to the table even if it's I know you were trying to get somebody to generate an ascii art form for the kathy for the act

right I guess in America the the character arc a thesis ack she wants chocolate right yeah it's just a silly thing yeah it's just a silly thing but there are so many ways that we can contribute one of the things that I try to try try to talk about whenever I can is that there are so many ways we contribute to open source or an article called 14 ways to contribute to open

source of that being a rock star if you go google it you'll find it and the point is that now you don't have to be one of these huge brains you don't have to be a dhh or a Larry wall or one of these guys who just has fantastic vision and coding chops because I'm not that guy right I just but I try to contribute where I can and everybody has a way that they can to contribute whether that

whether that's fixing a bug whether that's just verifying a bug in the code in the bug tracker or saying well you know what this happens on my machine and it's different on this other machine just little things like that can make a world of difference when it comes to development and so one of the things I try to talk about is how you don't have to be this a rock star everybody can

contribute in some way you don't have to devote hours and hours and hours every week but just every little bit that you can do helps and and I try to think I talked about how open source is kind of a quilt and some people and big squares to the quilt and some people add little squares to the quote but everything is just little stitches and every little stitch that you can add helps the entire

community the entire project helps the understanding of open source and why open source is so important to what we do in computer yeah and and it doesn't also goes beyond just code contributions you know you do the Bobby tables in the pearl but right Bobby tables comms a great example because i read stack overflow over all the time stackoverflow com it's a question and answer question

and so many questions so many questions or people coming in saying well how do I get around sequel injection and and of course Bobby tables is a reference to an XKCD cartoon about sequel injection and people understood that and but they didn't really have a lot of these newbies were coming in and didn't understand all the issues and I found myself getting so tired of saying

the same thing over and over again that I just set up a website and what I did though is I just scraped all the answers from on everyone on stack overflow and I said it just took the best answers of everything and just put it on a website so then I can just make it super simple to make the barriers to helping somebody solo just say go to Bobby tables calm and there's the answer for you yeah and

I think the important differentiation of what you did and some of the other scrapers is they're mostly trying to do click throughs you're just trying to catalogue and make these common answers yet more accessible at and is this something that like somebody can just go and contribute directly an answer to well and that's the other beautiful thing is that the source code for Bobby

tables is on github okay so anybody can go and fork the code on github make a patch and send me a request and send me a pull request the beautiful thing about that is that now there's a German translation of Bobby table Stefan our internationalization more in a bright which I have no idea i don't i don't know gentlemen but there's now a german translation there's a russian

translation and it's all hosted on Bobby tables so the guy who came along and said I'd like to do the German translation set up the code for me and did a lot of the translation but now I have this framework right so when the guy came along to one to do the Russian translation just add it'll add your language to it and now he's able to contribute that's why the beautiful

things that is done is that they made the barrier so low it's so easy to fork things to to make to make comments on issues in the issues database where the it's so simple to do contributions yeah and that's the that's the converse to what some lettuce was saying about his frustrations with Lennox's they are very high like in order to contribute jellineck's it's an

extremely high thresher to be able to contribute to the core but for most projects you would just need you need help read eat something that I'll just need a little bit of stuff yeah right and just and that applies everywhere that applies whether it's running a user group meeting you know you come in and you make coffee right and anybody can do that and it's simple or you clean up

afterwards so that you know your sponsors don't find a mess that right it sounds so it sounds so small right but it's not it because every one of those is a little stitch in the quilt yeah I can I cannot say how much I appreciated it scmc software craftsmanship McHenry County I don't often plumbing kegger McHenry County represented yeah yeah the MC but I turning around and seeing that

the people who became hit already cleaned up all their own perceptions sure I don't have to run a while I'm chasing it so I can talk to people and make new bees to the group feel more comfortable it's it's and it's so it's all part of an ecosystem yeah you know that when you pick up your own plates I can talk to somebody who's there for the first time it make them feel more

comfortable so that way though Tom and then we get bigger and bigger and it has to be it has to be undone because so much of what we do is you know we think of Lee sit here and learn of these great technical brains that do am a things and yet there's so much other things that need to get done and they're not any worse it's not like they you know they might not have the glamour but

there's still just its importance on the parent project for instance param is the virtual machine that is underpinning rokudo pearl which is the main implementation of pearl six so there's an entire virtual machine that there are some incredible brain power going into creating a virtual machine and that's way beyond my pay grade I don't know I that's way beyond me i don't understand

you know sitting here comparing garbage collection algorithms that's not that's not that's not some i think about right but i can do but what we do have is what's called the parrot cage cleaners and the parrot cage planners so that are the guys who go and they might look at a test part of the test so we can go oh this is this is redundant to this other test here we'll go and remove it or

we'll find a some code that for some reason is intended incorrectly or a comment that's out of date or we'll go look in the book in the ticket queue and go clean stuff up Jim Keenan at New York is amazing that the number some days they'll just be a dozen closed tickets where jim has gone through and said oh this is fakes this is fixed this is just six months ago and help clean those up

yeah all that kind of scut work is absolutely crucial and that helps have successful project people who are building the core not have to have a mess not have to so that way they can produce the thing which feeds back rent to the people who are using it right so you're using it you pay for it by helping do some the scuttle work and then it feeds back and comes a cycle

absolutely absolutely everything that we do anything that you do that an open source project is is valuable even just talking about it you sit here any read a blog post about hey look I found this project you know I found you know this food project that I that saved me an hour on something that is doing save spend 10-15 minutes writing that in your blog and or tweeting about it or

posting it to Facebook or whatever it may be and tell people about it because otherwise people don't know about it right and you know one of the things that it's funny because I have people come up to me a conference at some time and they kind of go a you know I'll say well tell me about what you do and I go well you know i'm not i'm not as famous as you and I say the only reason I'm

famous is cuz i have a big mouth right and I talk about these things I'm not any smarter than you are i'm not any better or programmer than you are i just talked about yeah and and hate here we are now yeah so that can't we one of the things that that geeks tend to not do is they don't like to talk about themselves they don't love to brag if they don't like to and that's not just a key thing

people in general don't like to and that's one of the problems of course that that they have when it comes to job interviews because they don't like to talk about what they've done they don't like to brag but part of this is we need to right now that we're bragging about how cool we are that we did this but that this is useful so something like ack i talked about act not because I

want people to somehow you know adulate me but that I want people to use it because I think it's helpful I want people to find useful things so and now so ack ack has a website called that the Act website is called better than grep calm because I wanted people to have other things that are better than grep for searching source code and there's actually a page on there or

talk about other constituents at are there yeah and now so now somebody has come along with a website called better than a comm building on top of that yeah and I couldn't be more delighted I love that we build off of each other that and you know it's not competition it's not it's not like you know your point my earnings right knee ticking so that's the only insurance paid software's is

you know the collaboration isn't it is desired with a competitor because they're going to be taken away your profit right whereas when is open sources hey just made some better way now I can use it now my life is better it's the difference between the scarcity mentality and an abundance mentality scarcity mentality thinks that everything is a zero-sum game whether

it's a jewel a shin or love or time or everything is just zero sum and an abundance mentality says that the more people that come in the more we have the more we have to give and so that's why I want to bring in as many people as I can to work on open source tell you so even if you just use it that's great because that helps all of us so that that's that's my philosophy behind it okay and

just that it kind of brings us to an end with you with your talks and you're writing about its own finding jobs do you mention it all or do you have any experience on using user groups and conferences to help find jobs why actually it's funny because I also wrote an adjust for another article on leveraging I believe it's called leveraging your open source experience

in the job hunt where I talk about or you really didn't notice in this yeah no no no that one I say okay well you a great softball hey because I talk about how these are all contacts okay but let me know day to day that we know our colleagues in open source help us when we're trying to find other jobs they help that we can use our open source experience on

our resumes because it is working experience it worked experience on your resume doesn't have to be paid right and so just as if you organized you know say you organized your kids baseball league that's worthwhile to put on your resume because and you tie it into a business need absolutely the things you do an open source should go on your resume should and you can talk about that and

say hey look you know what these are the things that I've done on this project so for instance on my resume talk about the parent project and about how I've gone through and done these sorts of cleanup things but I instrument the code for doing static analysis and I treat it as if it's a project that I got paid for I didn't but in the eyes of the reader that's still valuable work experience

and it's it's different collateral it's yes in a way the way you do get paid I but it's not through money right it's it's through recognition through use through recognition your attitude tributing back right recognition and gratitude are the art of the currency of what we do and so the other thing i like to say is that we need to thank each other more we need to recognize each

other more we need to you know if not only should if you get something if you find this tool that saves you a couple of hours of work not only should you write a blog post about it but you should send mail to somebody and say hey you know what I just use this at save me an hour and I want to thank you for it in that one minute I can't even tell you how much that means the reversal is

isolation yelling out into the dark Lloyd Wright that people are actually using this and appreciated that is absolute gold you want to sit there and encourage open source you want to encourage people to write these tools encourage them directly by letting them know and then just you know the last thing is that I what you're saying is I've a friend I who year old boy who I

will interview who does several Java projects every time he would get something I work with him it on every time we would get an email or some kind of context in somebody used my project and they have 20 million records in the database nor using it is that it's no problem the sense of the good feeling you could just see coming from India was he done this thing to scratch

his own image but somebody else got use from it he didn't he's not thinking about how I should have charged for that he's thinking that's really great and funny it's a very different mindset it is and it's funny because our day jobs don't pay us then that you it's not often you know sometimes at the end of a big project upper management say hey Loker bedroom then bring in a couple

dozen pizzas and everybody has pizzas and mushroom and thanks for God you know job well done and that's kind of gratitude yeah not the same as an email from somebody who goes I just discovered your website and it saved me X amount of time and and it made my life so much easier to thank you for doing that and so we all we all owe it to the other authors to open source to help encourage

that and that's that just comes back that's just paying it forward because it's going to come back for everything that we've done well thank you very much for taking the time strike me thanks I appreciate it

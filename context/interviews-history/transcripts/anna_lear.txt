user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations passera of information find out for yourself today yet you cast accom hi it's Mike again with you tastic today I'm sitting down with Anna Lehrer who is a community manager with stack exchange second change is a pretty large site and

if you're a developer you've probably have spent a good deal of time either asking questions or getting answers from the site thanks thanks a lot for sitting down with me Anna I really appreciate it it's good to be here I can you tell me a little bit about what is sex change overall and what is a community manager and how did you get involved in that sure well stack exchange is by now a

network of a hundred question-and-answer websites we started out with stack overflow which is aside for programmers of all kinds and pretty much a new language and our basic goal is to provide a place over several places where people can come with their questions and they can get expert answers on whatever topic that they happen to be interested in so as a

community manager I'm part of a team there's about six of us what we do is we try to work with different sites and different communities and try to teach them about what makes a good Q&A website what kind of things make up sites that are truly helpful so what we usually do is we spend a lot of time well okay let me back up for a second each each site including Stack Overflow has a

corresponding meta site that allows its community to kind of gather and talk amongst themselves and determine how the site is going to run and handle different issues that come up so as community managers we spend a lot of time monitoring those meta sites and jumping in to help out with answers and kind of sharing our expertise and lessons learned over the past several

years there's some of these mother sites were like what is the matter site it is literally pretty much exactly the same as any main site so let's say Stack Overflow on the main site on Stack Overflow you will have questions about programming you know she sharp jab or whatever on the meta site the only thing that's on topic is stack overflow the site so

people would come in with questions about why why a certain question was closed for example or what kind of things are on-topic they might want a clarification or they might want to say well we have a couple different tags that need to be merged can somebody help us out and that happens basically with every community we provide a way for the community to self-govern like that so

it's a it's way to say oh you posted this WordPress configuration Stack Overflow isn't the right place to do that check out WordPress Todd is it wordpress that stack exchange yeah so I mean basically you help redirect people to the right place potentially yeah if somebody came to stack overflow and they posted a wordpress configuration question and it got while now it's put

on hold we recently rolled out some changes to make closing a little nicer but they might come to matter and they can they can ask why that happened and somebody would say hey we have this other site you know your question would be more welcome there okay so you're you're dealing with a lot of developers who are maybe dealing with an issue and they're trying to get information do you

ever have to defuse any kind of situations or anybody get really angry over question being closed it certainly happens for sure our site moderators actually take care of a lot of those disputes that's what moderators are therefore is to kind of keep things running smoothly they're all volunteers and they're doing a fantastic job once in a while we as community managers also

step in I don't know that that happens a lot but there's definitely situations when somebody gets really upset and we have to be very careful about explaining to them how the site works without invalidating what they're feeling and invalidating with their experiences in so you you work with a team of six people in you mostly interact through meta or do you work with the moderators

um yes to both so we make heavy use of chat rooms so stack overflow in Stack Exchange has chat system as well so we have internal chat rooms that we use within the team and across the teams at stack exchange and we also have moderator only chat rooms where we talk to moderators and kind of provide more real-time interaction so in as far as is the kind of information you're probably

seeing I'm just curious is there ever been as you're going into moderating things I mean I'm sure there are some of the questions where you're like why are people asking this they read the FAQ but have you ever read anything but like wow that's really there any like questions that stick out in your mind that you might have seen or moderated or help move into the right location and I cual

that I never thought about that before that was actually really interesting um that's a good question I mean there's a ton of interesting questions that come through pro much every day I don't know that anything really sticks out right off the top of my head oh no that was 10 um yeah this is not gonna be helpful something on Stack Overflow that ended up talking about railroads oh really I

think so yeah well now yeah now watch somebody try and find it and it's gonna be something completely different but ya know nothing that's off the top of my head that I can duck point2 right now just maybe is there so much information that you have to troll through 22 to manage that it's not much that you actually read pretty much yeah I mean I don't spend a lot of my time anymore

unfortunately look like actually browsing stack overflow and reading questions for kind of personal enjoyment most of the things I end up seeing right now are actually problematic in some way somebody emailed us to get support or I'm responding to a flag for moderator attention or something like that so I end up seeing a lot of kind of average type stuff once

in a while though I mean I still I still watch like hacker news and all that kind of stuff so great questions still happen and they get promoted in those ways and as far as dealing with people that are looking at trying to get there you know again with the questions trying to be answered are there any myths that you've run into where people make assumptions like I know on reddit people often get

angry the mods and there's occasionally moderator revolts where they try to take a moderator who people disagree with how their other how a moderator decided a certain set of questions should our post should be handled or changed rules I is there any it's been anything like that with stack exchange we've you've had people directly coming conflict with a moderator or question oh definitely

definitely there's many many examples on meta stack overflow of that one that kind of sticks in mind is not the last moderator election but the one before it i think we elected for moderators and one of them i think at the time he was 19 and somebody and i think he closed a question i don't exactly remember the specifics anymore but somebody came to meta and basically wrote this giant rant

about how teenage moderators are ruining stack overflow and it is the worst thing that has ever happened so it was basically like he picked specifically on that moderator and things just went downhill from there it was interesting imagine that moderator moderator elections how does that work so about once a year give or take we run tomorrow writer elections so what happens is all

of our moderators are volunteers and won the site on a site is still in public beta I should probably explain that too when somebody before creating your site in the network we work from a list of sight proposals that are brought to us by anybody on the Internet we have a special site for that area 51 and once a proposal gathers a certain number of followers and people who kind of commit

to making that site reality that side goes into a private beta for about a week to kind of hash out the immediate issues and whatnot and then it goes into a public beta and during that time it's open to anybody anybody can participate and for that period we appoint moderators based on a few criteria people who were active early in the side who kind of showed aptitude for

community moderation but once the site graduates from public beta we hold moderator elections so this gives the opportunity for any community members who are interested to nominate themselves and kind of you know basically they they come back it come forth with their platform and kind of explain how they want to make the site better what you know what attracts them

to being a moderator what they like about the side and then people vote for them and you know so we have an entire system built for that it's basically open STD so it's oh man the way it works is somewhat complicated and I can never quite remember that there's a meta post on how exactly the votes are counted but it's basically people pick the top three picks and then the first there's a crowd

of like first votes that a person gets and then once they hit a threshold they were elected and then like other votes that cast for them trickle down to other people and yeah possibly not too familiar with that it's it's it's I'm not going to be able to explain a while but it's basically sounds like you have three candidates and then you vote there's a way to hash

out which one actually got the most votes of the three candidates I'll link to in the show notes cuz i'm not from australia I just saw that it's been explained to me by an Australian that's how it worked ok so you know just uh just be personally about you how did you get involved with stack exchange so I mean he talked about how moderators kiddo but how did the community manager

position evolved and how did you end up becoming one well how it evolved is slightly before my time from what i know a robert karti no he's our director of community development he was the first community manager that stack exchange ever had and all I know about that is that at some point she was approached by Jeff Atwood and they work something out which is basically how pretty much

everything I believe got done in those days but eventually you know the team grew by the time I got to it I'm a software developer by trade so I joined Stack Overflow didn't really spend a lot of time on it but when programmers stack exchange launched I kind of really got into that and it was it was it was somewhat controversial at the time it it was proposed as a place where everything

that's off topic on Stack Overflow can live and that really didn't work it just really created a terrible sight and eventually it evolved you know and that would became kind of you know the the wide board side of stack overflow where you can kind of hash out you know software practices and design all the kind of stuff but anyway I was elected a moderator on programmers so I nominated

in first election and ran and from there I just discovered kind of the rest of the network and I spent more and more time on Medes and I eventually went back to stack overflow and became a moderator on stack overflow and from there I got the job the community manager team coming through a similar path ah not necessarily uh unfortunately she's no

longer with us where we had a community manager aarthi who did not have a developer background she got on the team through an internal arrangement I think right now everybody on the team has some sort of development past okay so everybody has a little bit of loss skin in the game so to speak of yeah what what is being talked about and a concept of what is what is the spirit of the of

the conversation on Stack Exchange since people are marketing experts and people who are developers who are passionate about these topics and are good at walking with a lot of people well on Stack Overflow for sure I mean we have we have a lot of sites on topics that aren't really developer oriented we have a site about cooking photography video games you know what kind of stuff

there's differently sites where none of us have any experience with whatsoever but a lot but most of the lessons that we've learned from stack overflow and from other sides they really just translate across the board so okay thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with their really appreciate it thank you you

talking today alex is background filming and film what designers can learn from filmmaking thank you for taking the time to sit down with me yeah thank you for having me so so what is your talk about what what what is it that that designers can learn from protect people can learn from filmmaker it turns out that there are a lot of parallels between filmmaking and digital design and design

for digital products apps websites and and they range they range from procedural aspects of the process of creating something to to individual design patterns that I think are an opportunity for for web designers and digital designers to explore maybe apply some of the things for creating online so things like the storyboarding aspects of yeah there's everything from like the

tools that we use to even just the techniques for displaying something on a screen there's a wide range there and I think as designers talk more and more about storytelling and how important storytelling is to digital design we can look at different different ways of telling stories and other disciplines and pull those into what we do on them so so what what where did this come from

where did this come from uh so all through high school I was an art student illustration soon and huge interest in film and animation and that's actually what I started going to college for I dropped out about about two years in due to some changes in my life eventually wound up graduating with a computer science degree in finding my way into a design career but I've always wanted to

go back to film and animation I've always loved visual storytelling and over the course of my career I've just found you know I've noticed little things that seem to line up really well and I've looked for patterns that I can and things that I learned as a film student that I can pull it to my work as a as a designer so the cross professional yes yes skill I think

one of the greatest things that any designer can do is pay attention to other disciplines look at what they're doing why they're doing it and and abstract and learn from that so so what what is the example of something that there was a concrete day image alignment and film studies that has been able to been useful for you one of the one of the tools that I learned about as a film

student is called a beach sheet and it's primarily a script writing tool and it's basically an outline of your film with that just focuses on the major plot points and and their impact on the audience so whether they're scary or funny or whatever and and that's I've actually been able to use that at a few instances in digital design where I'm trying to communicate with an entire

team about the emotional aspects that we want to have exist in a flow and you know we use storyboards and we use comics and things like that but we've had longevity issues with those where they're great initially way but like the developers never looking at those things right but this beach he would we ended up doing is we took a task flow which is something everybody was already looking

at developers everybody's already looking at we just annotated what the emotional state of the user was going in and what we wanted the system to do to with that emotion do we want to leverage it to want to counteract it if they're scared we want to calm them down most Americans email exactly so so you're getting kind of the functional flow initially but then below we're

describing okay so even at this point maybe they're entering their email but we want to ask them through their email in such and such a way you know a calming consoling way you know so it's a way of keeping emotion in in perspective when you're you're designing I think that's one of the greatest things about film or any good filmmaker is that they can they can essentially like just put

their hands in an audience's brain and eat them through this experience make them feel things make them think things and I think we have the power to do that with with design as well it's just a matter of making sure that you don't focus too much on the utilitarian aspects of what you're doing you're thinking about emotions and things like that as well so when you're when you're

looking at when you were studying in your studies for film you're working with a certain type wattage certain type of not audience at the yet certain type of people who are interested in studying they had a certain way of thinking and then you come over to tech and those people seem to have a different way is it drastically different boys you're just a common thread that this maybe is

missing a few um in in tech specifically if I if I try to if I focusing more on like to say the development side yeah i think if you come out of that area it's it's very utilitarian like there's brilliant ideas of ways to do things better differently using new technology but it's very task-oriented it's very much these are the things you can do these are all the features and things

like that we're digital yes and then and then there's then there's the marketing side of things which you know is very much you know pushing things on people and just trying to get them to buy things regardless of whether actually actually need it um what I find you know the work i do i'm an experience designer the way we approach things is to define what we want people to feel and think

first and then create a product or service that can evoke that experience and and there's lots of people here at the conference that follow that same that same practice so in that kind of pocket I found so many parallels to what filmmakers are doing this filmmakers they have this story whether they came up with it or whether someone else you know wrote it they have this story and

they get this vision of what someone is going to see but also what they're gonna feel like they're gonna be scared at this point at this point I want them to jump out of their seats right here you know so it in and then how do i construct seen or a visual sequence that will evoke that response in the audience and that's that's what I love about

experience design is I see that basically is a very concrete parallel okay well thank you for very much for taking the time stuff thank you for having me Thanks user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today at Utah State com

you it's mike with you test them your rails cop 2014 them sending here woohoo two cats and Tom Dale were all the leaders of the all the creators of the Ambo project and also contributor to our rails and they give you gave a keynote yesterday morning and wants me to talk about how to swap profiler also thank you very much for taking the time to you

off to speak with me appreciate it would I know it's yet the end of the day in memory of these of the key no talking deviously and what the topic was sure so I be sort of talked about to two areas on the first area was just sort of talking about the idea of cognitive or ego depletion which is this idea that we have a limited sort of cognitive capacity it's like you have a battery at

the end of the day of Alicante 8 something today yeah and it's not and so a lot of people think of your chakra capacity is something that you drains uniformly through the day or it drains when you work at heart problems but actually turns out that a lot of the things that drain your chakra capacity really mundane things like making making choices or getting into a little bit an

argument can be like really defeating you can spend like five minutes getting a good argument you probably felt this after five minutes maybe you like drain feel it's like when you go to the grocery store like there's if you think we're there for like an hour your constant big incisions you get to the checkout line and there's a candy bars there's a reason there's a candy bar

there because making even like what brand of getty sauce should i buy Wow cause your willpower completely yeah so just a willpower all these things are sort of the same thing and the idea was just showing a convention over configuration idea that rails I think I've spent a lot of time energy advocating for species part of the same thing by reducing choices and getting

everyone on the same page about the false because defaults are really defaults are really a psychological hack that we can use to allow us to go when we're in a really good mood allow us to do more before we deplete you use up too much our capacity but also keep us on the straight and narrow we're in a bad so you may think we are being a programmer what do i need this

controller that you think that has zero cost but in fact it's actually staffing your the power to your ability to actually think through the more important problems yeah I know I've said the projects often but like how do you even get started cuz I'm thinking about what do I want to do Rose rose or my secret right like odd and really silly position like that like by the time

you've made a few of them and I think the important part is not to say we're going to take away your system right because people don't like buzzing economy for very good reasons what you're saying is we're going to give you some same default defaults are the that you use for than yourself they finally completed so you have the energy to work on the real problem at her parents and

even think about defaults you ever see the movie up Moscow on the Hudson Robin Williams first to see those are wonderful she nods from the 80s but whatever i think my cognitive overload I think about that scene where he goes and what's used bike and he's a from the Soviet unique what's my coffee and he looks at the conferences jerseys destroyed and then finally he's looking

that far he's running back before these like people people like people like choices a lot more than they like having to choose yeah yeah so that was sort of the first half of it the second half was talking about all the excuses that people give themselves to justify not building up these attractions so I think one of the most common ones is like oh I am so special I've always special needs

special requirements and if I don't you know if you make me use a tool that's for everybody how am I gonna get my job done with all the genes so special and then people when he when people get past their they said you know I am doing really the same thing as everyone else they use this excuse of the law of leaky abstractions like all these abstractions distractions are are always leaks so

there's no point even bothering with them and you ironically you see people making this off these arguments about leaky abstractions sitting on the top of the most epic abstractions attack right so yeah you have no people who are really allergic to abstractions but they're sitting on top of not just you know not just a hardware abstraction but see unix

POSIX live UV you know one of the most amazing dynamic language it's that ever been created and then on the top of that they smell promises that's such a heavy abstraction I can offer see with that well it's really fine too because they think about like it wasn't that long ago that people were as literally like if you want like short where was this like every new ship was completely custom and

at some point officers CPUs like general processors got sufficiently good as the traction that I was like you know what it's silly for me to be playing on a play on chips let's just use this off the shelf little chips that right you never think about no one ever is thinking okay I'm when I want to any new computer should I get x86 or on it's like okay I'm just gonna use x86 or are

those little to think that everyone's agreed upon nobody thinks about that so it's a little bit arrogant I think I put this happens every every layer of a fresh stack everyone always thinks like well IRA Lionel eyes distractions but i'm at the people at the thing that i am doing is so unique like really there's no shared salute your shared of dark could possibly encapsulate the problem

that I'm having I until you get to it I am going to cut this piece of wood I need to go and craft something which I can separate these pieces right yeah yeah no you just go get the saw exactly is fine i think the reason is that people go in when you're kind of it as you it says it's like layer of experimentation of the top so there's the extraction stack and then at the top

there's always a layer of experimentation and especially like a younger developer is less experienced developers they come in and they say well i try the extraction it was park again italy it wasn't perfect and so the reaction is not well I should wait for this mature their reaction is of course this abstraction as a bad news I don't laugh

i'm in the next time they see an abstraction they basically just ate they hate all abstractions and yeah and i think what's kind of cool is that when you get past this when you say no that's 86 is a thing unix is the thing see is the thing you can actually start building much much higher than you thought you could build before you actually start being able to you get

into a place where you have shared understanding of what it is that you're building and you can add steve job set and the quote i did in my top you can start them a 20th floor it's I'm sorry for the first floor and there's way too many people that are always thinking oh I'll just you know I'll start from the first floor of a time it's a lot simpler all right but really you want to be

building things having that shared understanding allows that or what the kind of like solve the problem once and start building on top a lot of times as you said the presentation that means having shared implementation like rails and vertigo sheraton facials that everyone can build on top of but even if you don't share the position you can just sharing common vocabulary having a

common interface so a good example that you going to used was the idea process everyone is having to deal with a sequence of aliens everyone was having to those implementing promises as a way of selling that but everyone's in play just a little bit different but you really couldn't build you could use these pieces together you have to build up a distraction so Dominic Nicola

really was 12 drove okay well hey look I'll dig some more things I'm going to write a test let's go test suite and if you write a promise information and we will just conform to this and I think had really unexpected properties or the verge of properties we're ok now i plus the sky now Tom Dobbs back now it's the WC specs and now actually support for is being built

into the language and that had to happen in a l'air de garça it gets me something almost like a diff see it's yeah it's a construct that you're going to be able to take credit but you're gonna be able to go from one you're already in this language you'll be like if there's no infant everyone rotate it function using completes you well you could imagine that someone says I don't really think

control fall really belongs in the fund its it is the thing people say about bras I don't understand why control falls in the language it's like hey guys guess what control posed in the language of a statement okay yeah i think we compact think you can add another a sea cruise control for proven to the language and i don't think anything is going to explode yeah yeah and as far as

a working these abstractions can be complicated and adversely the product could you guys are launching and as I said interview Malaya that's i'm not i'm not being sponsored by this but you guys are doing great long history just bring some community so i wanted to promote your companies can you tell us a little bit about an apology to reassert its also topping i think it's actually

related to so good sort as well because the last thing that we all worked out together so founders meet you who i am carl feel were hit by NBC back company before and experience is great it was very emphasize open source at the end of the day yeah that money was message saying if you didn't achieve liftoff right away Tracy like the team got scattered to the

winds and so we started told them we really wanted to do something strapped to undo people who scrap the road let's turns out it's hard to think about the proud if you're bootstrapping bankrupt yeah so we needed some way to make money and the obvious way to do that is to come mpreg right there's like on the VPN for there's meteor ink and there's p.m. I think there's like a long someone

history of deceive a company's doing open source where that's like a company breath and let's go to the console model but for us we feel like the best innovation happens when you have pens coalition updates all working together and there's a one in four companies will be like Pinterest we like rails where it was a 14 in there are numbers for many different result work and I go steward

it they do a lot of work on it anyone have three skin census and actually you can't fully ideas and you have to argue for your ideas on the strength of your merits and i think is very important so so what do we do now well we wanted to go to the Google we have no claim we believe in fact with our problems and we also believe like your strengths so we spent a long time thinking about cable

for hours so one I think we know how to build developer typically for a long time carlsbad asset building systems yes and I think we have a brand we know the real stuff and we know that is that obviously we know the real estat strict it up at some point yeah so so so we both Scott and the reason we thought skylight was lacking all the way that cleanup time arctic like five years ago

DJ for the blog post called the problem of averages he said if you're thinking about the porns of your web app seeing in terms of averages the words he used were useless and plum there he said we really need is a histogram you need to see the distribution because if your statistician can you use you use averages and big problems normal bell curve but that's not what I'm sorry

water so he said this in 2009 it's 2014 crews can there still have not been any tool on the market that was spent I'll just stay off the shelf and get that right here if you're a google or your Facebook or Twitter you have teams building is for you but it's not you know Joe or small shop so so that's what skeletons skylight basically gives you the tools that the police have to think

about web performance and way the supersensible super fat and perhaps like me really fast really responsive pretty easy these is it possible without Scott to be able to see able to look at that the metrics and be able to try to figure out what kind of characteristics like it's a bit of a user i canna admin log me in and do Reggie that's what the histograms line basically if you have

average you're taking cash hits cache misses RSS feeds xhr as admin users that causes three more down pastries that happen they're taking all of that you're compressing it into a single lump so what having an Instagram there we keep the little script so we can show you the histogram for any time slice up to 30 days for any end point yet so you can see like oh it looks like there's a

cluster you can zoom in even say off looks like it's taken seven hundred milliseconds instead of 200 it's because I'm doing all these extra queries for myself so one day that you want to meet you left that is that it's not just the histogram once you decided what part of the distribution you want to look at you actually get a really high fidelity trace which tells you you know first you

had this rap thing then you want to just controller let you make these three database queries then you start rendering a template you make these three database queries and we just announced that where else got that we're adding cebu profile very very low in fact maybe like 10 microseconds per request to do siebie profiling and then that

means we'll be able to say here are the actual Ruby it is the Ruby code that actually spent actually spending so we can basically not just show you your the distribution of your request we can show you exactly what is happening in type of request and not just what's happening inside you know the average request but what's happening in small requests or fast professor is there you know maybe a

faster dresses fastest you're not running all this work and then a little look at that maybe sounds like they come from but actually completely completely changes the way that you diagnose because the way that you do today counts highlights is you say oh it looks like there was my production our response that's not really bad and you know their bed the averages pads really bad so

you're like okay let's go I close this way you view you check out the app on your local machine you run it you maybe put some seed data you try to life its load on it plugged it extra database can't reproduce well I guess we'll just praise just have to get we use a skylight is have a graph resume backs on your smikers where the 90's of how expected selected in the chart now you

have a cool to delegate stack trace exactly what was happening your app in production on your production boxes it doesn't matter you have to think about ahead of time you can go back 30 games and I mean can I even find out like DVF another processors impacting what I'm doing like I'm learning something also I'm looking my app in its I got these really slow replies at a certain time in

the day I can't see anything weird in my effort is it does that cpu for me like see that all there was a we don't do anything like that right now see you can definitely imagine us doing our goal in general so I went to find the kinds of problems that are hitting that people are kidding and we're very small team only six people gives us a lot of numbers 10 so that means is that we have

me look what we saying there what kind of monster it's a really kind of one that we notice is ample time for your table ready to take forever also we spent the time to actually you have to tell them everything exactly show you our beautiful Peter Khoury in Singapore question see how we added CP profiles not is it once great man i have a team big area of this Ruby because I've no

idea what it is and we get more so if we notice that it's not a problem is like you know there's a matter of Java this fake my Russell is really common I think we'll probably start yet we have a lot of terrors and things like the tribute racing we want to get into it really what we had up working on is based on what's the next next thing that we can do that will help another group of

people we diagnose what's going on until you're kind of a little bit of yeah I mean we run skylight on our own a bar I'm happy to rip big choppers or else a from these guy that's a weird-looking it's valid everyday this wait to see what thank you very much for the good times we brought me and thanks for all your aircraft having a number and rails and

almost great thank you very much i really appreciate ya user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yeah cute a sitcom you

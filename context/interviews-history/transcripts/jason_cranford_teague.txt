and sevens division says yeah uh but we're sitting down in and juiciness is written suboxone by simple I mean over 18 books on technology CSS and web technologies first of all say thank you for sitting down with me forgotten and then I want to ask 18 books it's had ever taken a long time when did you get started in how yeah the one easy it's it's it's something I remember though I

met my wife in 1994 ah right as the web was starting I moved up to upstate New York commenced Larry polytechnic go to masters science school their technical communication and I remember one of the first things i told my wife was that one of my dreams was to one day walk into a bookstore and see my name on a boring you know I said that they've been a dream of mine for a long time and so I

got into the web around 94 mm-hmm and started doing stuff and I actually was fortunate enough to go to school with guy who wrote the first book on the web called the World Wide Web unleashed oh yeah John December and that was the very first book on the web and he you know he it kind of inspired me to want to do that even more um and so after I graduated I was working on web design

early on and I was one of the early adaptors of frames yeah I know a lot of people friends I actually loved frames frames solve so many design problems for me ah and so I did this really great site for a journal called pires and did it all in frames and I had a acquisitions editor from coupling contact me and say you know we saw this side we did and we're looking for

somebody to write a book about frames and I have any wonder they caught it how to program HTML friends and i pointed out to them you know you don't really program frames right not like that but I you know I was yawning I was like I want to write a book I don't carry my college you know she caught the Satanic Verses I could generate it I don't let you know if I know and so I read the bug went is

the greatest book in the world but I learned a lot and and I got it up the door and so and it sold okay um and so what year was this in 1996 I got in fact I've just gotten married when I started writing a book about my wife is often touch reminds me that she spent several months after we got married I do a book very to a book so um and said well then we actually we moved to London for a

while and so I kind of riding project to help kind of pay the bills while I was over there and that became it was a book for peach pit press ok part of the visual quickstart series which always already popular at the time came even more popular and I wrote a book called d HTML for the World Wide Web ok and dynamic HTML yeah and I probably owned your book except you well mine have it

it was very popular and um I knew that I wanted to talk more about CSS in it so i let them I got them to let me have two sections and one on CSS one on d HTML and eventually the book evolved the next edition was d HTML and CSS for the world wide web and then it became CSSD HTML and Ajax for the world wide web and then the couple of missions ago I was like I I'm not as good a JavaScript programmer

as I used to be so we just dropped in and became css3 for the world wide web and that's the one that I primarily work on now um but over the years I wrote on video editing a good final cut pro my brother is actually a pretty decent filmmaker he's a documentary filmmaker won an Academy Award so he knows what he that's that's and he and I worked on a book on Final Cut Pro together and I've

done a few others but mostly my interest has been teaching designers opposite cascading style shoes so I I just curious that I mean looking at starting a 96 for example that's going into lifting is kind of the heyday of tech publishing just couldn't bring your clothes and then coming into a modern times later 2000 attends publishing is starting a

little bless ya that I remember a few years ago y x noble at borders you were in rid of getting smaller and smaller ensnare like techno second lower smaller eyes yeah it's funny I mean I'm old enough to remember where there one there was not a computer book second right there was time to settle into it and they started adding and you know we're not 80s they started adding computer

buster it became he warned more computer books and the section got wider and wider larger larger and then in the 90s when the web came along suddenly exploded and web took over and became internet section or the computer science tech was still at I middle section of the computer section we came you know first it was a shelf and I became the whole thing and then it became an entire

row and then it became 36 of types of three grades and larger boobs years and you just build with all this video yearbook and over the last several years I've medicine shrinking shrinking and shrinking and most bookstores I go it now I don't need to see my head books anybody very few points yeah then examine regression almost nothing it's only when techwin I think they're

cheating supply one is in a most information that i write is available online so if you want to book it's for having the book as a reference because you want it because it's faster for you or you like having it all in one place where you want to have it so that you can actually sit down and read it so weapons books are becoming less user um the other is that you know amazon i

think that's probably most tech people are going to get their books from amazon not from your local parts in that so how does that affected your trans for you continue to bright like our books Michael and on a high this for the last minute or two I have been really great many books per se the six edition of visual quickstart guide CSS visual quickstart good the last thing I

body of work I was very interested with that and seeing a lot of what they wrote about played out and seeing how it's happening today very interesting so what did happen what but then it didn't happen like that a lot no one really foresaw the ubiquity of cell phones which is interesting because when you think about it it almost seems like a no-brainer now that eventually everybody

would be although you could say star trek down because don't wreck had the communicator right yeah what did what does a communicator but a cell phone yes pika I fancy cell phone yeah so I've been doing a lot of stomach like that because my career has been very diverse I was feeling creative director for AOL red which was farewells team channel so I did a lot of investigation into tunes

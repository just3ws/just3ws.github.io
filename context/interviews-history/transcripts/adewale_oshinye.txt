hi i'm mike with you tastic here again at SCA I'm sitting down with Eddie ah ah Shanaya and we're it's a little late at night so I apologize for the for the dark light word we don't have the best lady but we wanted to move forward with the interview because I think what that a has to say is interesting enough to to want two warrants I'll good listen yeah now you call through the apprenticeship

patterns book with a Dave Hoover and it's been a very well-received book in the software craftsmanship it's been a very useful tool that people who want to become software developers can look it but I'm curious as to how you see apprenticeships and the console of the user community is there some kind of way that people are interested in partnerships can use the user community

to learn more or is there value for user communities to reach out and talk two apprentices okay so when we try to define what apprenticeship meant we were trying to get at this idea that you can't just learn on your own so one of the examples that was really instrumental get to meet understand this was that I spent a year trying to learn to juggle oh and I'm bumped to somebody

for 20 minutes in Belgium and I mean more progress in their 20 minutes with that person who had an entire year title in for a book and that made me realize that it's so much user learn from other people and it's better if it's not just one person which is the traditional model of an apprenticeship it's better there's a community of people because they can teach you different things you

still want the one-to-one relationship with a mentor but you still benefit from a community in fact one of the patterns in the book is called kindred spirits okay and it came out these experiences with a lot of user groups where he was learning new skills and so for us it was there as an apprentice you needed a meeting you ideally need to be a member of multiple communities so you can pick

up a variety of different skills but also the community apprentice is people with that kind of mindset can bring energy to your community where they can bring new ideas especially if they're members of jersey else exactly but also they have you get somebody comes in and who wants to learn if you want to do everything you consider boring everything you've considered oh

yes everybody knows about that right having somebody new in your community means that somebody wants to come in and if your community is bore the TV then somebody who finds it new and interesting and they wanted to know the details and they will come in with a different perspective and they may end up reinventing it from underneath you and this is one of the most powerful

ideas that you can bring me below to 3t teaching the things the committee does does well and then listen to their ideas so that when they revolutionize or you can just improve your community you can actually incorporate that right and that's kind of interesting I mean I think of a person interviewed earlier Colin Colin Jones he was in a practice of 8th light and he just embraced or the

closure community he embraced enclosure community and in turn embraced him back and now he's contributing very much to other people's learning so he went from being an apprentice seems something cool going to their community saying I'm willing to learn let me help and let me learn and they said okay sure here you go and then next you know he's he's pretty much an expert or closure and

people would far senior in the industry are coming to him for help that's I think it's very interesting I think it's very even Apple idea one of the things that some of the patents we talk about the book is this notion all share what you learn it actually came out of an initial happen call recorder if you learn which is a figure that you shouldn't just go for a loan should

write down things you've learned why you learn them because in the future you'll look back on this and you'll get new insights and then one of the things we realized was that actually just because it with me now in this experience the things you've learned doesn't mean you all you want to publish it right but as a very narrow set of things of circumstances where you

want to share this with a wider community because you believe that for me to a benefit but you do that after you've got so stage of comfort one of the things of community can provide you with it's a place you can go to try stuff out to say I have this idea i show it to people and they may explain to you why it's broken but because it's your community or the community that welcomes

you they can guide you with your errors so it's all a lot of a safe place to share that's one of the great things about having a community especially outside work you can say I took this thing we're building then I rewrote it in I oh I okie yo yeah jail on lambda and arias and it's a huge giant mess I learned a lot of things from making this huge giant mess right and that's okay

because if the community that cares about learning yeah but if you do that your job you know we're probably nothing worse because there's a potential for financial loss there have been to finish stanislaus but it's also the sense that you are taking risks with the data your company is giving you to get risk with the trust other members of your team placed in you but knowing that you have

this safe place and go to to try stuff out is actually really valuable about one of the Packers in the book is called breakable toys it's based on a quote from the dastan balls David's from graver yes and the beauty that is decided I often do things and it's okay to not work right because the goal is to learn not to build something that works so what am I is a very very slow or

just to write a parser for a language for a magazine that is the protagonist haha the magazine when possible it launched the first edition no they shut down and there was a contest they ran to build a positive so people could write articles for magazine but the magazine gone the test cases for the positive still there and I mean using now the break little toy so I Brighton in Java

and how to write in the parser and the lexer everything but I rightly in Java I'm not using any of the Java tools so we're trying to go them all from relatively speaking standard word up most of that i'm not using any ide and using it just text me that's my text editor no friends extensions i'm not using any Betsy build tools i'm not even using Java doc I'm using Java p I would

have read the method to purchase of things Wow is insanely difficult yes but it's forcing me to actually think about what I actually really know about Java and what I just sort of offloaded to the tools and they can be aware of the distinction between I know how that works and i'll just read that a java and that distinction is quite powerful the other thing it does is that it forces

you to really think about how you design a puzzle but when the oldest has first right which makes it even harder right I have to stay in to where the pausing books are saying at this point you switch to Adeline and I'm continuing on and it's something that pretty much believe you were calling airports as well yeah because I'm something I do completely offline so it's a very slow

project but it's very inefficient so the ideas is not and this is kind of a sounds like a coder to exercise rip very large where it's you're like I'm gonna do this my hardest way possible hahaha yeah but you know the goal there's no deliverable there's just the exercise it's like tending their garden it sounds like it's like well maybe not well my bonsai I know for certain nobody's going

to use this then I know I'm going to use this I don't even like syntax of the language of that much but i find the exercises challenging because this is somebody who designed the grammar of the language for set of problems which are very large there are no compromises to make it easier it's just this is what we'd like the language to do and there is a community of people

who built working versions of these or they sponsor in a variety of languages so I know it's possible i can see ahead of me on the road all the people who built work in implementation of the sensible way it took them a few days and i've been working on it for about a year now off the hardest way possible you can sit on gethub I I don't make much progress because maybe six months ago by

and I'll actually look at it and i'll get one test of us right i'll write down what i learned and it's up there publicly if anybody wants to look at it i'm not sure how much value bill get from it i get a lot of value just forcing myself to very explicit paint deliberate very careful and building something that's very true they like i was saying i think that's almost like

trimming the mad scientist in me has just wanna it's there's there's no there's just the Zen of working on this thing but there's no deliverable there's no end to it there's just the journey and so that's very interesting well thank you very much for taking the time to second

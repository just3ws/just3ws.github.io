hi i'm mike with ub tastic I'm sitting down here at SCA with Brian Merrick a bright Merrick is spoken you speak a lot to non-technical audiences during agile training you've even done exercises where you simulated what a program does and how a computer works for for a business audience and then you also come to how the technical conferences like a cna and talk about how to write suffer

better ending really deep into concepts behind why we write software the way we do I'm just wondering about going between these two worlds and talking to these two very different ways of thinking audiences how do you how do you handle approaching those two different types of talks or audiences so I think that the way to think about it is the two kinds of talks that I do r 1 is an

explanation of something so for example I just did an explanation of logic programming and test data generation here and the other is more a way to I guess stick memes in people's heads so the goal of a the how to do something talk which is most technical talks is to tell people something with the expectation that at the end they'll be able to repeat a good amount of it back

to me so I'm trying to give them an explanation of something that makes logical sense to them so it sticks in their mind as a as a sequential set of explanations and usually the way you that works with that is to cast it as a story of some sort so we are beings we live in time so when we think about explanations we tend to think of what we should think of them as

logical consequences of one fact and another but what we actually do is we think of we tend to think of the Morris things moving through time so you tell a story where the things happen and then another thing happens in another thing happens and you lay that over the logical argument that you're making and so since we're so built to listen to stories and tell stories that helps

people tell us are back to so that's my goal in a right I'm never kind of yes in a technical kind of talk now the other kinds of talks are more sort of mean implantation talks so for example I've done a series of talks where I keep hammering away at the question of what are the values that didn't get written down in the agile manifesto so there are some the latest version has something

like seven of them and so the purpose of that talk is to get words really stuck in the heads of the listeners so one of the words is ease for example an argument of mine that I that I make is that when I look at agile groups people are very focused on making their work not easy but with ease so for example my wife is a surgeon or has been a surgeon and she describes the process of surgery

when you got a really good surgical team working with you is you're sort of talking through what you're doing and you reach out your hand and the right instrument magically appears and you just move it so there's that sense of ease and the idea of giving examples of ease and using that is that when people run into problems I want things like ease to pop in their mind

so we know when we're solving this problem we should think about ease or we should think about being reactive rather than proactive which is another characteristic banjul projects so that's the goal of the kind of non technical talk it's to to make things stick in people's heads and I also do keynotes a keynote has the same sort of property of making things stick in people's heads

but the real goal of a keynote is to force speakers who come after you to refer back to the keynote so the theme yes well the thing with the setting those we thought it did mean is I just wonder is it because these ideas are often hard and esoteric but having one thing you can kind of hold on to gives you an anchor and then you can work back from that or use that as a point of

reference is that well the main thing is is I think just getting people to think of it you're in a situation there's an idea that would be useful how you get have you like program people such that when they're in a situation where that idea is useful they actually think of that idea right so that you to do that you have to have you have to have the craft I guess of telling stories visual

representations stick in people's minds so if you're presenting an idea but visually and auditory it sticks better than if you're only doing one of them jokes were lots of different methods to get that word or that simple concept into their head and then such that it will pop out when they need it and when they need it then they can go and figure out what that really means in their

situation yeah I was just thinking about earlier today I saw tweeted that's some study discovered that by introducing humor into education test scores that's a net experiment went off because I for whatever is a hybrid read the article yet but for some reason humor helped with the lasa you can have people remembered it better and were able to synthesize whatever information so at

least that way they could return it regurgitate it or whatever on a test they were immature retainer but also when you talked about the symbols humans tend to think in a symbolic that's why with Sarah's talk when she was showing how change new symbols and visual metaphors into the teaching that she's doing or the mentoring that it seemed like people were better able to wrap

their heads around these topics and understand them but as far as speaking to an agile community I you've gone you've spoken at user groups other other like agile user groups so they're like things that were people who are occurred during these agile planning agile coaching do they get together and have they certainly have I've drifted away from agile per se being an agile coach

of the past I guess now three years so I'm not sure of the current state of things but at the agile Alliance web page there used to be a whole page full of user group of contact information I assume at least some of those user groups are still existing and so running what were they basically this I've not been to those cheese also can focus on non technical user

group but I'm having gone back and forth between those over the years and seeing how they handle their teaching and learning together as a community or or even at the conferences um not so much because I live in the middle of nowhere so it's not like I live in Chicago where I can go to users groups my going to a user group pretty much has to overlap the time I'm on a trip and being in the

user group so I don't have a lot of useful things to say about you sir but I think at the conference's though an agile or conference versus a technical conference is there a difference in the way the communities interact with each other or how did how do they is there been any market difference aside from the general topics of the conversations between the two different groups the two

communities I don't think so in the particular case of the agile groups the agile groups were especially in the beginning pretty heavily programmer dominated peed mcbreen said way back in the beginning of agile the buzzword that the agile methodologies or methodologies treated by people who like to program so it was dominantly programmer ish it back then and I think to whatever extent

there is a unique program or culture the agile culture tended to pick up that so there is a certain playfulness for example that appears in both groups I don't get invited to speak it like sales conferences are things like that so i don't i'm not sure that the two communities are really that far parking and just one thing about the way you you craft your presentations how

what is what is your process for for creating a presentation for keynotes um it's somewhat random in in the sort of the same way I mean one of the reasons why I became sort of an early advocate of agile is that that matches my style and like I said one of the values of agile is you react to information rather than proactively do you think that is you you do little experiments you try

things you see what happens you get good visibility into what's happening and you react to that so a lot of my talks start out with a basic idea I don't write outlines I haven't written an outline for anything for since other than my high school and my talks are very very low on word count very high on pictures but not just the random picture but a picture that's actually used in the

explanation and I got to admit that the the way my talks happen is i'll be this is I'm what I'm going to talk about here's my theme I go to youtube or Flickr looking for a creative commons picture along those lines I get a picture I fit it in there and the content of the picture since I've talking about abstractions in some way the content of the picture

will change my talk so it's almost in some ways this is for the less technical talks in some ways it's almost kind of picture driven development whichever picture I find and then then it's a matter of practicing it and becoming fairly sensitive to the to the rougher spots and it can be hard to notice those but if you talk about it you talk about it you talk about it you keep talking

you keep practicing it and you see the rough spots and I go through lots of revisions of moving things around and throwing things out and so on and so forth so for example a talk I just gave is on its ninth revision 12 or 14 revisions of a talk is not unusual okay well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me

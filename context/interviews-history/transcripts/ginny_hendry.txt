hi i'm mike i'm here with Jimmy Henry at Windy City rails and we're going to talk a little bit about how Jimmy is involved with the the rails bridge wounds outreach our workshops and also the chicago ruby in chicago javascript groups so Jenny Keene you tell me a little bit let's start with the rails bridge women's all reaches those were very interesting yeah railsbridge

started in san francisco by it was started by the to sarah's sarah mae and sarah allen went to the san francisco Ruby users group meeting and looked around and said why are we the only two women in his room and they decided that they would do something about it so they started rails bridge which is training for for women in basic rails to get women started so there's a lot of them

and running in San Francisco they run quite frequently but there were also starting to run them in other places so year and a half ago we had the first one in Chicago desi macadam started that she had done them before and in fact the railsbridge anybody who's done at once as as a student can easily run as a student or a teacher can easily run another one because it's a it's simple

up to do what you've done at once so we had the first one here desi ran it and then we've had two more since that up that I have grown and they are two parts the night before you have install fest so that everyone can be ready in the morning when the class starts to do programming we're gonna get everything installed some people they installed on their own machine so some people takes a

while yeah depending on the condition of their machine and what's compatible all that stuff but that we get that out of the way the night before and then we have a whole day of program and it is introductory everyone is invited sometimes we get people who don't know what the command line is for instance and sometimes we get people who are experienced programmers

other languages and we take them all and train them give them a full day of training and what we find is that some people they love it and they keep coming back and you see them again and they get jobs in the field and all that and some people find that they don't like it but that is a valuable thing there yeah you're wishing and hoping they know yeah they getting over that hump and saying

oh I really wish I was a program and then do you for a day or so me like no yeah yeah some people are cut out for it and some people live but it gives you a good amount of time to try it out and see and they're well scripted to you so that it supports just pretty much anybody any any level you just sup sup sup sup step you go through it it's that's one of the best things about it

is that the curriculum is already set and it is open source so it's out on github so if anybody wants to run their own training program using that the curriculum you can and the install fests curriculum is also up on github so that makes it really easy to run one of those because the hard part is making a sensible curriculum of the appropriate length in the appropriate level well

that's done we just have to get the people together to execute yeah and you know it's just something that our people have learned about I mean obviously or shouldn't I obviously but the way I think is that people who would learn about the rails or have it i should say how do you how do you find people that might not otherwise have been exposed to ruby or else how do they find out about

dwells tutorials I don't know ah there is a Chicago women's developers group here but that came about after the first railsbridge and then I don't know how the first one was publicized yeah because does he get it but but it got a pretty good crowd and right and now we you know we have a regular mailing list and we can send announcements to anybody on the mailing

list and then we ask everybody to have their friends sign up and but but I know what the method was to fill them yeah yeah cuz it we think that with it with user groups you can communicate to other developers and there's channels that developers tend to fall on but if you're trying to reach out to somebody's maybe not necessarily are we getting the industry yeah or they're not found

twittering things like that that they might not know so yeah that would be a shame to find out how how that communication goes out yeah yeah yeah we should be doing more of them and in that case we should probably do something more yeah finding people have you seen anybody come in through the railsbridge workshops and then end up coming to user group meetings or yes there have been

several of them who have done that some of them you don't they don't come back because they live far away so hard that's all right it's some of them as I said find they don't care for it but yeah we have seen some come back and our and our biggest success is one of the people who came to the first railsbridge who had never done any programming at all but she'd seen it because she had

friends were in the business he said you know I want to try that from absolutely zero experience and exposure and she came to railsbridge and she's done a lot of work since and she now has as a job ezreal I mean you actually really did change somebody's life yeah they went from not being your work number to being a professional programmer and working in the industry that's every dad and I ok

so you know if i may ask you know with with women in the industry you know and it's obviously something that you want you you feel that you put in your own time to help teach other people who is that something that you know in user observes the chicago women choose your group were in chicago intense developers in groups and in you know the workshops obviously in a little while though shaw

chicago rubies which was actually more of a support network for aha I I hope I'm not mischaracterizing when the group was but it was people who were the wives of professional software developers so I think Alan and I knew when they were supporting each other the way he's the way I understand what the group was I you know is there something that's uh you know having having been a

woman going to use groups up a bed you know it's been overall friendly something that you obviously enjoy kissing you see all the time yeah I like going to use a group meetings and conferences right that's true well it's a its user groups themselves i found that been perfectly friendly there are very very few women who do show up but i've never had any any difficulties

going to them and over and I haven't noticed any other if other people having difficulties going to them or being unwelcoming like that I think it's really it's just a reflection of our field in our field in open-source development it it's about three percent women I've been looking around and County yeah and it's about three percent and it's true not just in Ruby it's true

in Python and the other open-source areas it's true in the US it's true in Europe it's true in one place I've looked at in South America it's true there too so it's a reflection of our industry not of our user groups they are just we said with an open source to vomit now do you did you see something different and people may be working on like corporate plat for enterprises oh

it's very different very different overall there's about twenty five percent women in our field but hardly any of them are an open source also you are in or enterprise things oh yeah and in bigger and older companies have more women and that's an interesting thing why is that one of the reasons is that bigger and older companies have HR

departments who have regulations that way endorses yeah they're not you know that is not people just tiring their friends which in very tiny companies that's what it is so that inevitably builds on itself the first people started are certain kind of person and they only hire their friends their friends are probably guys similar yeah yeah young fellows yeah yeah yeah just

like them so the tiny tiny companies that we often have in our business are less likely to have any kind of unusual outsider types brought in risk because they're so small and they only have an HR department any other and I think it might be something that having more p I mean because the one thing I have observed is it's finding your network through user groups and in finding

employers and making friends for user groups that encouraging more women maybe to come to user group meetings and come out to conferences helps them to start to have those women have make those friendships where they get ya brought in yeah but it's it's hard to get the ball rolling whenever you're talking about numbers that are so small and it takes a while i know i went to ruby users group

for a long time before I felt like I knew anybody you know it'd be like being in a room full of strangers for a while I didn't know anything about Ruby when I started I've been programming for years but not in Ruby I didn't know anything about Ruby or anything about the people in the and the users group i just showed up every month and it took a while to settle in and now i know everybody and

everybody knows me but that is a long time years later so it's it's not like you show up once and everybody's your best buddy and you get six job efforts now yeah you develop the reputation and then and get to know people to actually know them beyond just saying hi how do you like the pizza yeah it's it can be difficult particularly for the typical

nerdy introvert programmer personality yeah but that is one reason why we have hack nights here Chicago Ruby uh I started out ahead it was a suburban group and a Citigroup combined so then it had two meetings a month woman suburbs and one of the city and I said the Ray who runs the group you know we should have a hack night too and raise an excellent delegator and he said okay

you run it then so since then we've also had a monthly hack said we should do yeah yeah yeah so it's good delegating so the advantage of hack night besides you get practice of course that is extremely valuable for people is to practice their coding and to practice their perico ting if they don't have a chance to do that at work it's also a chance to really meet people in not a

strictly social atmosphere you know the time before the presentation had a regular meeting is strictly a social kind of thing but if you are sitting paired up at hack night for an hour and a half programming with somebody then you get to know them and so that's another advantage of having that yeah and this is just one thing this is a it's strictly a general question because

obviously as a guy I don't know what it's like for you know I remember what it was like for me as a newbie coming into Ruby and sitting down and being completely intimidated sitting that with established developer oh yeah yeah feel like like oh god they're gonna laugh at me because I'm such a dope I don't know anything I was live as a dot net developer who wants you a hack night for

our spec and a slim ski is running the Technic and I barely knew Ruby at the time much less of a Marnie then so it was extremely intimidating for me but again I was also in a ring full of guys and you know i don't know if that made a difference like is it something that you know in your experience working with the women in the rails bridge and also what's not like

being alone yourself yeah you know that is that something maybe is off-putting oh I don't know uh because for me it's not but that's because I grew up with three brothers and no sisters and I went to a college that it was the second year that had women in it so they were hardly any women there and I majored in science at that College so the hard any women there so I spent my formative years

being one of the very very few women are girls in a group had a large group of people so so to me it feels fairly normal so I if I walk into a room full of people in it and it's all men with name tags yeah macbooks I you know I feel right at all so it is used to it this is my date might be quite different for other people I don't actually know okay well you thank you very much me for

what you're doing a house off for taking the time to speak with me all right thanks Mike

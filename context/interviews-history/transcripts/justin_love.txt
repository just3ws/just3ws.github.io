hi welcome to Windy City rails i'm mike with you tastic send a year with justin love you're here at the Windy City rails conference 2012 and I'm interviewing people who run these are groups and technical communities Justin love is a fixture in the Ruby community in Chicago and also he helps from the Chicago Jas and the Chicago Ruby and you said you were starting a demo days in the suburb

yes someone else had the sort of started the group and like posted 1 million one message the message board that really went anywhere I his member bsmida membership expired yeah so I figure I'll pick it up for a month you know call it the people I know in the suburbs maybe some of the people I know here that you know or you know there's a fox valley entrepreneurship Center ECC yeah maybe

some people wanna sit atop her so you're looking at something that would be connecting developers with entrepreneurs well it's it's targeted for is I don't know if I the same visions the original person anyway demo dates you know if you're if you're you know you're you're not has many startups in the suburbs I'm not going to not be looking for investors bre you do have lots of small

businesses maybe they just do like to support maybe they're working on iphone apps maybe they're working on their own cool amp yeah but you know that's all stuff you can you can get up and you can practice your pitch and need to get some feedback on how to improve it or maybe they're starting a little site where they interview of people that do technical you know if you want to come

out that people to cuz i mean there's a few user groups out there so now you most people had bump into and everywhere uh you know you're you're dealing a lot with a javascript in the Ruby how did you get involved with windy city rails and Chicago Ruby to begin with um well initially I was just sitting out in the suburbs feeling awful alone yeah so I finally decided well you know I can't

you know go to these expensive conferences all over the country you know effectively so I you know got it got a you know take you take it and get on the train take that big long trip go down the user groups and find other people doing similar stuff yeah and eventually actually wasn't too long I diacono hey that's something I could talk about you i think

it was like originally liked about the same time i went to after really fringy was future Ruby ok so I did like a lightning talk of here's my cell yeah so yeah yeah yeah and then somebody else you know said like oh what's at lambda I can talk about that yeah so that's where I started started trying to figure figure out you know speaking stuff and then do that once or twice and you know

where I said hey you wanna be an organized for the group yeah and so I mean your way out in the suburbs as well so you got a long commute and i'm so looking at sorting the demo days out in the suburbs you know you kind of describe a little bit about the difference between being out in the suburbs and gender groups and being down in that in the city I what has been one

of the most obvious differences between being on the suburbs and going to a group like a CMC or some of the groups starting to see more pop up and versus coming down to Chicago this is a a big difference a looking that would be too terribly surprising i mean it's smaller you get a lot of like people you know a tea shop or a one-man developer shop a lot of times a lot of people they're

just you know they're looking at you know pretty basic stuff you know a lot of them were doing like me up each bead or that kind of your website your businesses you know and that means potatoes something and you know that's providing value those businesses right word it's just something that the cool shiny tech were usually talking about downtown yeah yeah I never thought it's

like white this hip hipster hipster mm-hmm not as many parentheses yes and you know and you know with the small community and you know most of the new shiny tech okay sometimes their work their kind of begging for proposals but yeah you know I think the the Fox fella could be professionals you know takes the summer off because people are busy right but they're generally good coming

with content so it's all good yeah and I mean do you think that's a I mean obviously you your passion in my user groups you think it's is that something you would recommend more people to do I mean that if you're on the suburbs I mean though yeah I got kids and all that evening yeah I mean I you think it's something it's very and maybe just because I do it because it's

that structured social for the people who are you know it as naturally inclined to the social interaction thing yes so it's a safe place worry but you can yeah it is very easy out there you don't you don't have these big you know hundred you know member of attendance groups that you know it's like you know go to meet up and it's there there's a couple of them but probably it's easy to

believe that you're sort of in the middle of a desert and not think that anybody's out there so like when the Elgin Technology Center sort of sprung up and you know I think the first article was thinking it more like us I should downtown know start up and get your type thing but it was like oh hey there's some other people out here yeah so I'm fine interference yeah mm-hmm

well thank you very much for taking the time sucking yep thank you thank you

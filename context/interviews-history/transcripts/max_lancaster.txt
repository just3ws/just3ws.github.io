hi i'm mike i'm here sitting with max from the washington DC alt on that group imax not do it good yeah I'm good I cannot you know we're down here to talk about the alternate group can you tell me a little bit about what you guys are doing in DC yeah basically we're pretty fairly small group we've had a couple of real big meetings but it depends on the speaker usually our format is that we

bring in a side speaker all right who does a presentation and then we kind of hangout weasel always have pizza of course you know for and so we vary in size but we have a pretty core group a small group of people who attend pretty regularly and mostly small signs like we didn't I say about 10 to 15 who are pretty regular I would say and so then we've had probably up to 50 4258 at

different times we got a topic brought out for good Kelly I was a JavaScript remember the guys name but uh his Tiki Wicki what is name a boutique mad it's his Twitter yeah booting okay he's a jsf guy remember is actually a hammers twitter analyst yeah so so we had we've had speakers on Java JavaScript enclosure mercurial fitness and quite interestingly being a dinette group most

of our presentations haven't been about done that they've been about things peripheral net or just new technologies and that's been great and it's good to learn things outside the dotnet space and and you know when they're saying that you bring in speakers that are talking about a variety of topics it sounds like you know you're not being able to go to to my croissant you love

speakers kind of got to go to other communities or are you picking up other developers who are also deadly these things are they using them how did how do you guys go about reaching out secure I mostly did we have a very solid founder of our group fat hog sake and he he is very active in different communities and he has a lot of contacts Eastman's mainly been the one so far to

bring in speakers and we're kind of working on getting more kind of becoming more self-directed and becoming a real community but once we have such strong leadership he's kind of been the one bringing in two people we have on a few occasions that particularly our material one of our one of our kind of solid members by guitar mercurial presentation did a bang-up job on that one but so

basically we kind of have strong leadership so that's kind of how we've made all the contacts and we've had some really high quality speakers because of that but I think we'd like to probably branch out into more open space or lightning talk type format so that we have more kind of self-organizing that I recognize you from within student top-down you're bringing in your you

you're looking at tryna get more people from the would typically be audience members yeah exactly right this but I think we to think we'd like to have more kind of participation in the selection of the topics and in the presentations as well instead of just being an bringing in outside people all the time I think we kind of like to be more of a meet-up style you know at different

times we haven't really experimented that too much so far but things are working out and you know but we definitely have you know some solid members who kind of presented on doing comics so like Ruby on Rails who has somebody group from within within the group was ever one of the founders of the group came in and did a tough because talking about the rails as well

and you go with uh are you kind of on a monthly cycle or yeah usually monthly we've been kind of on a break right now but but for for us all a couple years we were going strong every month and I felt like that was important I mean it was really you know Matt was one who I kind of talked to when I got involved he was kind of running the group and this kind of worked out that way but I felt like

it was important to the committee to the key having the group meet every month so I you know made sure I did everything I could to kind of provide a space in my office and honestly part of the part of the reason that I got involved was just so I didn't have to spend an hour in DC DC traffic to get there so I just you know offered up the office space of my

couple we had a nice space so yeah that was you actually shot just like you should stop right now my next question I was going to where do you typically meet so so where did they meet before you off into space I think they've moved around we didn't have a pub night was a while ago but mostly at Motley Fool which is the company I work for we've been meeting in our offices now pretty

consistently for a couple years and interestingly I've been making every effort to get more people from within my own company involved because I think it's good for for the odd the environment and you know for people to be exposed to these different technologies so I've had had a few people from my office come in and help facilitate as much as why put me now

especially when I couldn't be there so that's you know it's varying degrees of success on that one but I just feel like it's good you know i like being involved in the community it's convenient for me because you know i just right there i'll have to do is going to provide a space you know coordinate a little bit of pizza and you know it's kind of pretty simple and and I and I think it's you

know kind of makes my job enjoy a more enjoyable day to day because you know we kind of bring these different speakers in and talk about different topics and it kind of gets some discussion started within you know that was in like my teams aware that I work with every day that's an interesting point is he open it has anything that since you're you brought that meeting into your into your

office and you're trying to get people from from your own company to believe participating is it made any like change like are you can be adopted some new techniques or technologies and maybe learn about through the group that right now you can take back well I found weird most of the people that I work with a real solid they're usually on top of this stuff and actually in the sometimes

we'll get a speaker coming in to speak on a topic yeah then I'm not too familiar with it will actually prompt me to ask my co-workers about it and i'll be surprised about you know the level of knowledge that they have sometimes so you know a lot a lot of kind of more front-end programming but I don't necessarily do day to day but I would kind of get

conversations going at work about this or two things so so it's you know it's a it's been a good experience for me you know it's certainly a good way for me to just because I'm not necessarily always the most proactive about not going out learning new things so it's a good way for me to kind of do that yeah what kind of cute as you know that that user groups means coming up and yeah if you

haven't followed them on some you know there's gonna be a thriving that's right that's right cool all right well thank you very much I sit down and talk thanks alot maxx with Washington DC on tata group thank you very much

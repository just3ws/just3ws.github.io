hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at railsconf 2014 and i'm sending your assessment who is the executive director for women who code other an organization if hear your your i think is a sponsor here head rolls come and actually I know railsconf is sponsoring us to be here oh yeah that's that is really good so you're here and i'll stop that's helping promotes let me do code well first off i

want say thank you for taking the time to speak with me and then second what what is women to vote it sounds like it's real comp is supporting you that it's it must be worthy organization what they should so it's a nonprofit organization that helps excel women's careers and technology right now we have about 10,000 members and really broadened butter is to have regular

events that focused on learning and advancing your skills in a technical language so we have events that are focused on building something building an app in iOS or like building a website with rails okay and those are like regular events that women can go to to either start from scratch and learn the basics of order advance their skills they're also speaking opportunities that

women can have especially when they're like a few years into their career or even a few months into their correct sugars you hold conferences as well we don't often focus yeah we try to be a part of their technical conferences by having a boo this and talking about women who code and we encourage that our members really submit proposals and be active in the conference process so how

how does that work how if I i worked with it with a woman who was a young developer was just coming in and she was kind of new to the tech community and trying to introduce our vin to meeting people you know how if if I know somebody who is interested in a woman who wants to be a developer or grown developer how could I maybe introduce her to women who tour or

that's yeah the first thing to do is you can refer to the woman code website you can also refer most of our groups are on meetup com and we're in 12 different countries right now and different cities and states in California I excuse me in the United States so are we might be where she's located especially if it's a larger city MO so much fountains yeah so so you can check out like the meetup com

and see more on there and that will be like a really good first step what what's nice about going of women code event is that they're like like-minded folks they're all working on a technical project and you can either join there's or start a new one and it's just like working with this town of friends that we make along the process there's there's a few organizations that I know

about the fact i think it's the girls who code and there's there's also the osh hyper women's developer and the rails bridge outreach workshops do you collaborate with any other organizations or mostly work within your own structure yeah we definitely collaborate with different organizations especially rails fridge and girl development we always talk about the veto atento railsbridge

integral development event because those are very much more focused and they have more the teaching kirky level format where we're a little more freelance space so you kind of you pick what you want to work on and so they're equally useful and we leverage each other all the time so if I'm you know if I'm also maybe somebody's not a male but I want to use a group I want a la confiture

what are some things maybe some advice you would give for how some of you might run a tech conference or our user community could maybe reach out to is only I guess langue française is it all humans organizations that can work with women who code or is it the we can partner with anyone who wants to work with learning to code and the ideas that were achieving the same

person purpose which is to excel women's careers in technology so is the company it's usually it's a company that cares about that because they're trying to hire developers and really diversify their stuff so yeah it's they they feel aligned with that goal then they'll usually reach out to us are there any events are coming up in the Chicago area because most the audiences in Chicago

okay and so unfortunately there is not a woman to cut in Chicago well but if anyone's interested in starting moon cut in Chicago I'd love to talk to them okay great so they can just freaked out you through the through the from a new code website yes definitely minus Coketown yes yes it's a woman who cocom and can reach a spin just secret on the street in meetings yeah user groups with lots

to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yeah cute a sitcom

hi I'm Mike I'm sitting down with Charlie Baker from Denver and he's kind of been involved with a lot of the groups on that area and he's also heavily involved in the open source software did the maintaining water and things like that but not pertaining maintained um but I can you tell us a little bit about what you've been doing out in Denver with the different groups

and and what you've been observing up out there sure absolutely I'm so we're talking about user groups and talking about general community involvement my move talk to Denver about six years ago from the San Francisco Bay Area there are a lot of user groups in the San Francisco area some of them were well maintained some of them were not so well maintained when I came out to Denver

basically noticed there were a lot of disparate groups a lot of kind of like splinter factions that didn't actually talk to each other very much so there are java java usergroups usergroups to room user groups so that's one down in Hamburg when I'm in boulder and there's not a lot of interaction between the various groups there's not a good sense of the software craftsmanship or Sasha

guard software community as a whole right in that area so one of the things in building in an office for work was looking to build out an office property by now right now groupon yes one of the things about hiring people in and doing this sort of thing is building our communities getting a sense of community that you can actually draw from so that people know what's happening right so um

so you're kind of going are you going to different user groups and talking to the leadership and try to say hey what's what's going on you guys are doing these meetings but sure of course put that right now let's get a sense of each each of the user groups it's interesting between the different languages and between some of the different communities that exist so you know the

dot in that community a java community one that there's a different feel to it to each of the user groups so it's a matter of kind of figuring out what what the different feel is and then we were talking is greatly about kind of an overarching getting getting the heads of those groups together so that you are you've got kind of a simple people that you can

talk to about things like scheduling so you know if you're doing Ruby which are also interested in iOS brothers will make sure that those baits don't collide material ended up having one cent on top of another if you're doing a conference for example we just did a Rocky Mountain Ruby so a few months ago pulling people from you know the iOS community blowing people from java community getting

getting our people from outside the Ruby community interested it and let them know that things like this are available all right i'll show you me like I'm a ruby dad that I've gone to to Rocky Mountain ravine I don't know that right in my backyard that there's and I use an iPhone and I am interested in iphone hey there's an iPhone iOS user group don't you go check them out you know is that

the kind of yeah that's exactly right i mean i find a lot of crossover between you know particularly in my experience between ruby people doing ruby development going to iOS and getting involved in that rehab so just being where those groups are out there not getting people in the iOS groups and saying you know why don't you Mac to Ruby come see how we do things I've got

the experience of that particular user and like I said each of the user groups at kind of has their own flavor so it's a really interesting experience to go from one language to another and then you want a larger scale purchase like that man and agile group so there's agile vember there are other groups and apply outside of spring technical groups as well yeah then you know I've done a

few interviews day and a few people who weren't necessarily our Ruby developers we're looking at the Ruby community and trying to use that as a model for what they want to would like to see in a dotnet community or almost it was Donna developers are looking at the Ruby community as far as like working with user groups I since you've been kind of cross pollinating

is it as dire as a situation and the.net groups is some of the people you don that I don't think it is when they're looking over 30 ticking oh that's the way I want to be I give any perspective on whether or not maybe it's a game it's a persecuted going that's a great question i mean i think in the Ruby community we've been really fortunate to have strong community builders I think

dotnet and Java communities suffer somewhat from not having them I'm so I think there are lessons learned and we have a quite person I think there are lessons that there would be community can learn from other grasses in organizing a group creating a conference and all of the kind of common themes I think it makes sense for us all to kind of talk together at kind of omen work at

a level that's right I suppose and it is would you recommend I don't be too leadings the question but if you have if somebody say watching and they running either they run a done it or Java or an iOS or Android group what would you recommend they do to maybe become guess this is kind of leading better citizens in their community yeah they're working with their group but how can they

broaden their perspective that's a good question i mean it fake attending another group in the first place and just going out and finding anything happening out there is good if you look at the various user groups the people running the user groups generally are your community leaders right I'm so it's a matter of you know getting those people together to create a broader

sense of community in an area so Deborah itself has d.video population-wise it somewhere around a million something like that don't know the specifics but getting a broader sense so that we can all draw from a common pool and have nauman experiences and i'll switch back before you having walls between the different communities yeah and you know yep thing you're saying that the earlier

you're talking about how Ruby develop there might be interested in iOS and even in our conversation of it earlier about meeting meeting plans stuffing on each other like I am a ruby dev and I use vim it'd be nice if they weren't on the same night um do you see a lot of that kind of like I would like to go to both many guys you see a lot of people that are peering at different groups

that you see the same person going to multiple groups as well conceived it very frequently yeah which is which is kind of surprising outfit so I know a lot of you know net and Java people would work we are doing that during the day and I want to do me at night the you know so ladies so there are different interests and it your day job might not necessarily be where you might want to

go so the attending or vice versa maybe you go iOS group from a.net group something like that and I'm allowed to cross pollinate shares not alone across homogenized there are so it is people tend to be stuck in in their various communities the normal walls between the communities I think probably one of the better what at least ball communities is kind of ruby in iOS so I keep mentioning

that review JavaScript for eons as well the other day that was a fun there's a lot of crossover and there's a lot of interest by Ruby developers in in these different technologies most Ruby developers are also web developers and they have no max and that's right you know itself that's right so it's a natural is yeah it's essentially a natural grass over whereas I see you

know I did Microsoft development years and years ago kinda doing Microsoft development is very tough because you do end up kind of caught into a very specific community and a lot of people don't get outside so you know the recommendation is trying to find out what other perks are in the area on which religious group absolutely go check out there some other meetings and

talk to their talk to other people the community leaders say from each group should be talking to each other to create kind of a broader sense of community they have no sense of competition between the versions i think it makes sense for us all to collaborate together on building an area all right on so you know as far as far as finding people there's a

dearth of software engineers and it's very hard to find people right now so I think creating a community makes it much easier I people to find you can figure out how big or solving those heads of problems which affect me at all of our communities great well thank you very much Charlie for sitting down with me thanks appreciate it see grant very much

hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here go to complement 14 and i'm sitting here with 10 dre who's the co-inventor of xml and he's a keynote speaker here today at the go to kop i think very much for taking the time to speak with me today Tim I can you tell us a little bit about your talk and that you're helping people take home from it well I've been mixed up in my you know my most recent job was

at Google and I spent a couple of years in the Android groups there and then subsequently did work in other areas and I become keenly aware of sort of the tension in the marketplace between people who are to the browser and web technology centric and people who are mobile-centric I think there's our some really good reasons to worry that the notion of the browser its Louie is

losing its sensuality in the world of app development and so what I'm going to talk about today is is that really a problem is that actually happening and if so why and assuming it is happening is that a problem that we should worry about and if it's a problem we should worry about than is there anything we could do to do to improve it now this is unscheduled but I'm also going to take a

side trip into privacy okay I cuz I've been doing a lot of work on that recently and in the era of that Snowden you know we should all be worried about that yeah you may think you don't have a privacy problem in your work you probably do yeah well I mean even with all services that are very popular like HipChat recently I don't know if you're familiar what they had a change in their

privacy policy when our one-on-one chats are able to be exposed to your employer I mean even things like like that ah and when you talk about to go back to your original key notes when you're talking about browser versus non valves are you talking about native apps versus yeah i'm talking about native us you know increasingly if somebody's going to build an app they're actually going to

build three apps they're going to build you know a browser version and an iOS version an android version and that's already a problem because you're having to replicate your work multiple times to get a result and who knows you know windows mobile could get a good football we did i'll be doing our work for x and rises the right there there's a problem then even different form factors well

you know that just comes with the game that's actually you know not the big biggest part of the problem and whereas you know there's a lot of advantages to mobile apps people are moving in that direction for reasons some of which are good you know there's some downsides to that too and we need to you know make sure we understand what the upsides and downsides are having a browser centric

world view as opposed to a get a mobile app centric world view and make the right choices in an intelligent way and not just you know to inner interweave that into the privacy is it a good thing that we're moving towards native apps in versus browser as far as maybe privacy is concerned it's the reason I ask is I mean I know cookies and spine you know cross-browser checking of cookies and

tracking that's one thing you can do in the browser but maybe you wouldn't give it do you like that made it man I suppose but I think that's a small issue compared to the big issues and the big issues are you know the actual criminals and bad guys who are trying to subvert your account steal your information and your money and on the other hand the over at us your over-enthusiastic

employees of our governments who feel that you know everybody would just be safer if they knew everything about everybody and why would anybody want privacy unless they were doing something wrong I think you know they have much bigger tools and cookies they have you know court orders and national security letters for us to area vote well I mean there was actually a tweet i saw this

morning about the amount of data that the NSA is collected with some the order of exabytes it would take 350 years to sort it that like is there is there a point where there they just have so much information that it becomes well Google's got way more than that Oh google you know give you sub-second results or results i'm searching the whole thing so you know that that

doesn't really sound like a i would buy that argument i think that if they employ smart people who know to who know how to interesting and so on which they do they would be able to make good use of us so I mean that kind of describes that there is a precedent for having extremely large I mean we use it every day it's become a household term you know grandmother's who've never

is computer they know to google for something and they can sit through data like nobody's business by one the NSA be able to do that what what have you found in particular the maybe isn't something that people are really talking about yet I mean children's obviously a very popular topic but well I think we need to buckle down and think about it i think that to start with you know the

room i'm talking to today is going to be full of people who build apps and a question i would have for them is are you really confident the your app will work if I address it with HTTPS URLs as opposed to HTTP URLs even better you know does your work autumn deserve automatically work with HTTPS only right because if you do that then you've removed you know one huge went to a

vulnerability ranging which is open to anybody from the NSA to some guy running fire chief in a coffee shop right and I think it's you know it's incumbent upon the app builders to take a big piece of the responsibility for preserving the privacy of the people who use it and that means they not only need to do the obvious things like use HTTPS they need to think very carefully about you know

what information they gather about people when they store with people what they tell people what their policy is as regards legal demands that they receive and need to be clear about that stuff and because laziness produces under the bad result but you know well you know having been guilty about myself as far as looking at the expedient happened like I the last few years or some of

years ago xml was the defect early the exchange of information but over the last couple years jason has kind of become in more popular in there's pros and cons about adopting a very strict of semantic language like XML Dick and Harry's me I'm more easily correct description of a language through xml versus and the loosey-goosey JSON is that something maybe that's indicative

of the way we're approaching writing applications at this point where we're just like what is the least model buffer I need to do to push over the wire should we be stepping back and really thinking more about how pushing stuff well you may be right but that's okay I mean there's so much work to do that we should all be trying to do the simplest thing that could possibly

work you know do things in the simplest way that were then you worry about your constraints and as regards xml versus JSON I mean JSON is clearly clearly superior if you're exchanging you know database records and you know file updates and that kind of stuff if you're exchanging you know blog posts or you know credit reports your medical health records XML ones for that so so they

have you know different areas of strengths but you know I would worry not so much about the you know the form of the content through its XML adjacent I'd worry about is it traveling safely across the network in a way that somebody who is using my app can be really really sure that they're connecting to me not somebody else and nobody else can watch the stuff going on

and then having established that sort of the the bare minimum barrier to entry then you have to answer questions like okay what if I use your app what information are you gathering about me how are you protecting it under what conditions will you release it and to whom and you know you could write there's a real big takeaway and letters a fire 50 feet high and sit and they say

don't surprise me right you know if you people are end up getting a nasty surprise what you're doing with their data the results will be really bad for you and you won't so even want to avoid them all right thank you very much for taking the diamond street me appreciate it user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community

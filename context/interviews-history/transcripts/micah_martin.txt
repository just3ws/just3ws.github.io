user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with you Tess i'm here at SEMA 2013 today I'm sitting down with Micah Martin who is the founder and CTO of a flight he thought is also the main

organizing body behind the SEMA conference at this time it didn't start that way it used to be a pair relationship but we'll get to that in a second I'm sorry I went off the script there but what is interesting is that SCA has been around for five years but there is a history for a flight working with the community and having an open relationship with the community that

went beyond just a conference in a user group so thanks for taking the time to sit down leme I appreciate it yeah so I remember someone years ago you had a small office up in libertyville yep and there was a few people but you had this idea of a pair Friday and people could come in I don't remember for you to RSVP or something like that but you can come in and and sit with with your company

that was really interesting and progressive and I had never seen anybody doing that at the time what what lets you starting there was that your first experience dealing with opening up to the community or how did that manifest well it comes from a long a long way back you know started my career how I learned everything was really by working with other people and meeting new people

I mean that's how new ideas came into my repertoire and new languages came with merit tomorrow so that that community that working with the public just anyone you can get your hands on you know right working with them that's how you grow as a craftsman and you know one of my concerns that a Clyde is that you were a red tight-knit group but if we don't have external influences we're going to

stagnate with the knowledge that we have and so it was important to kind of open up a flight and invite people in so that we get more cross-pollination at brain and it was just I can remember that you had some apprentices at the times you are already looking at the craftsmanship Tom console babe I don't know if this was pre craftsmanship manifesto when you

were doing the pair of Friday's or was that it's probably around the same time we're on the same time yeah so this was all these are all ideas were still formulating at the time or the craftsmanship ideas right I mean that was another event that we held at our office and that that might have been one of the like the spirit was over there we were already embracing the the

principles of software crash drip tip via we invited about 20 people into the Liberty Bell office to talk about software craftsmanship as well so it's all part of the same motivation I think right in the the pair Friday's is that something I mean I know I once personalized dance that's my history I my first introduction to ruby was actually at one of those pair of

Friday's but uh and I had no idea what was going on and to this day sometimes still don't know what's going on but the were there a lot of people that embrace it I know a few people I've spoken to the ones but was that something that you had a lot of participation in people taking advantage or no not when we were in libertyville and we call it was a by the way Oh wazza yeah friday afternoon

is there was at ten wazza yeah what uh it's a Japanese work it's a Japanese term it's something that we use to use a lot of martial arts it basically means to practice okay so whaza is our practice time right so Ethan actually has a lot of references to you and you're big into the Japanese culture so easily even it's all I mean it routes from like the name of the company and a

lot of the principles come from my experience in martial arts you have like one or two black belts don't you yeah I do yeah so it's a you know you come to a conference see where's the bodyguards yeah a lot of practice right like that better hit myself but I mean what the real value of martial arts self defense I think it was the discipline the philosophy and that was

the real value that I got very good and so you've been considered so now it's year you've grown from being this this small tight-knit company to being 60 people yeah and it's you don't really have or I don't you have the formal para Friday now it's kind of a thigh University so it seems it did AFI University which is a friday events where people come in and do

presentations and there's kind of an open time is that something that evolved from para friday or was that a totally different initiatives that you it was different and it was just convenient to merge them but the whole idea of the had a thought university was that we we expected our craftsmen to go to conferences and give talks and you know some people did some people didn't and

it occurred to us that giving a talk at a conference can be intimidating right can we have an audience people that we share knowledge with so why not have our craftsmen teach or gives give talks to the rest of the company and we started doing that or like well you know we're not working any client stuff right there's no secrets here while we just open it up to the public right and

anyone can come and that turned out to be really popular especially when we move to the city and then you know we were already doing open source good practice wazza and friday so well people would just stay all afternoon and work with us and so that's kind of how that about now I mean I'm this also makes me think about a lot of those people that I met many years ago I was in internet

world many years ago are still with these light in our so integral or growing in their in their capacity his has do you feel that this that embracing an open culture where it isn't an isolated you come in be closed the doors we lock the doors be of tree I mean you do of course have to create secrets but the information that you're sharing the tools those aren't the trade secrets

it's the clients work straight so you can come in and talk about the tools you're using it's not Michael that person works on closure so they're the only ones who can work on that know they're going to teach everybody else right I learned that his it is that open nature do you think that is contributed to some of the long-term retention of employees at a fight or is

that something else do you think but i would say i don't know what your actual numbers are 44 turn over so well you're right i mean a lot of people have been at a site for a long time and i don't know if it's exactly for for our openness you know i like to hate plight is favorite my favorite job it's like the most fun I've ever had at work and my goal our goal in wooden eighth light

was to make it that way for everyone we wanted to be the fun place to work for people who are passionate about software and I think that's why people stick around do you think you've not you wouldn't think you would know this have there been any people that have come in through persona of a file university or participating in a pure iwasa events that you've hired in is have been

something that's been recruiting tool as well as more about just sharing knowledge or getting the name of a flight out there well it's uh yeah definitely I mean people have company at University it's a it's a one way that a lot of people first get introduced to a flame and yes we've hired several people that have come to a fight you but that's that's not how real intent right we just

want to we want to share with the rest of the world but we we believe that what we're doing is it works pretty okay and whereas a lot of people are not doing so well with software and so if we can help the world get better and make software more enjoyable for all developers out there that's a win too so when a company is looking at ways like if you if I'm a company

be in another city and I'm trying to think of ways that I can be more engaged or the community and become more part of the community instead of just being an isolated company what are some of the what's some advice you might give that they might want to think about when they're approaching the developer technical community and how how they can maybe effectively engage the community I

would say just start I mean just you post something on the web or tweet about it and by people into your office you know people who see that they they value that you want to share with them and that that builds relationships and over time word will spread and it'll grow so does it start a lot of it is just kind of relaxed not everybody's going to steal your IP to the one where they walk

in your door no and you know you don't need to be super prepared i know some of various let you sessions you know some of those i've done a pretty horrible you know people have to they have to know they're coming to this kind of informal event there's no it's been polished there and then they know that right but they're still about that's valuable to them anyways you know if sometimes a

rough cut can just be as useful as anything else yeah yeah well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down might really appreciate it my pleasure this is not a body hurt crushes my hand alright thank you very much for that user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of

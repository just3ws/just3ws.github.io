hi I'm Mike here again with you be tastic at SCA right now I'm sitting down with me and immersing Liam gave a pretty interesting talk at Madison Ruby a few weeks ago and it's it's it's spread around quite a bit in that it was such a positive message to the people in the Technical Community so I just want my kind of gym where where did that come from so so I've been spinning for a long

time and working with folks just wherever I have this like rule like I can drive and it's single day to your location i'll come hang out okay well have fun and i'll get to meet a bunch of people and over time what I noticed was that there was a lot of ceremony that went into actually engaging with other developers and usually started with a very long explanation of where they were

and how they got there and then it's followed on by a lot of apologies haha yeah i miss our this is correct yeah exactly a lot of self-deprecation and the irony is that it all stems from somebody saying like I really want to get better right but I don't know how and like my current social circle isn't providing it right I mean some help and even the courageous act of asking for

help did not mitigate like all of the same kind of reserved and preservation yeah they're trying to get away from so the torque is basically just that it's it's a it's an artifact of not understanding why the best parts of people are the things that we suppress right and just we chase kind of this weird similar to perfect or or mastery that doesn't really exist so that's

really what I come to say which is that whole just up to a standard that's great but like you define that standard like be excited for the little things be excited about the big things but just be excited right you're awesome like you're you're already here you're awesome yay yeah now what now now what do we do ya know what now we're here we're alive let's have some joy right

all right yeah it's a 30-year life right so why would you hate the third real life like yeah seems really odd well it makes me wonder if if it's hero worship and sometimes I think one time in the user group I was uh I was going to do a talk about solid principles and who walks in but Uncle Bob and I immediately froze and it felt like I can't do anything that's going to be good enough

I'm only going to mess this up and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecies right you know it becomes 0 now i'm going to sutter and now i'm gonna but it was okay if I gotten up there and he said well maybe your understanding wasn't and that's actually what happened and I actually turned out to be great because he said well maybe what should the way he described it this in the past

right maybe we described it like this it might be better and then that was a lot of fun if you in the minute you remove the barrier right who the route that you remove that ceremony that we're just talking about like four in urine seems like I'm gonna give this talk and therefore when the time comes I'm going to my now start talking about it right you've essentially because of the

structure of what you're doing head to right so then anyone in the room can say I hear you're saying you're close yeah then that shouldn't embarrass you in the sliced it should be almost affirming like wow I really am on to understanding this and now somebody who has more wisdom more time more experience was able to enlighten me further so then next time I do this talk or the next

time I have this conversation it's gonna be that much better yeah I think a lot of times when someone goes to a user group or a conference it's always under the guise of the person who's talking is an expert right and therefore they should be experts experts should be experts but sometimes in our we forget that there's an amateur aspect to what we're doing that your professional

programmer and you and you should be competent your skill but when you come to a conference you're not a professional speaker you know it made me fear somebody who gets paid big bucks to come in and talk about a topic okay there's a higher standard but you go to use a group that it's a I've learned this I want to share it back out and I want to just at least reciprocate

back what I've learned in what's what I've come but I'm an amateur speaker I think that puts too much on the person's view yeah and I think it it actually does the group of his service as a whole the person who's getting up to speak simply had something to share yeah I think I think putting them on doesn't have an amateur or professional really yeah drama shehr i have a friend Joe

worthy who does this thing when he likes a topic but isn't an expert right he will start his talk with hi I'm Joe and I don't really know everything about this yeah I'm just sharing what i've learned and i think it's cool and i would love to discuss it further I'm not gonna get everything right right and he just suddenly puts it out there and then goes into his thing and what's amazing

is he's so good anyway that yeah he's just killing it and he's doing great things and then there will be challenged from me on it's like well you could have done it this way whatever and he goes Thanks awesome boo boo yeah and it'll be in the next version anyway and he just takes that knowledge bazan so he had any action presenting he's still learning absolutely yeah I've never met a great

teacher who wasn't actively learning I've never met a great developer who said that they were done or they were a master and that they don't touch anything else my coworker Jim lyric is this way its lucky pair with Jim and he'll discover something new while you're pairing together and he's absolutely brilliant right but I I did have the fortune of playing a board game

with him that engagement yeah and he is one of those people that if he wanted to be an arrogant so-and-so he could be because he's at that level but he's not and I think that's a beautiful i losing proposition like what do you gain from isolation you gain zero and one of the things that I about is recognizing individualism in the context of the whole thing right

it's it's letting those people be themselves no matter where they go they don't have to modernize they do not have to conform entirely and they can still create a cohesive unit I think he's one of those kind of people like does it his way has a good time always learning and you can present him in any kind of context and it works right so it could be all junior developers could be all

expert developers and you should they'd have to contribute its part as him right rather than as a family or a simulacrum of him and I think that the hero worship the celebrity stuff and it subsequently dogmatism that kind of goes with it is an artifact of us holding to a standard that really does exist and I think I think internally we know it doesn't exist we recognized that it is a

falsehood that there's no way that that uncle bob is on the bottle all the time or like you know why is why all the time right there they're people that have these external personas that are distilled but that's not the entirety of them that the the person right right yeah and then whoa and even then not all was uh well I think that sometimes when people get off in a talk they put on a

persona pradana II a mask good call it I that term comes from some psychology that I haven't read yet but I've heard that term mask that we have our masks that we wear in that it's it's a little bit of a protective thing though sometimes we do it because we're afraid let impostor syndrome night well no I don't think it's impostor it's it's getting up in front of an audience and

figure out a way to engage with them that isn't entirely natural to our personnel yeah okay I think that some people are more comfortable of of getting up into sharing and being very like here's my heart check it out and others are more like okay I'm sure guarded I have to assume this kind of identity so that way I can feel safe sure inky

with those people you seem to be more of the check out haha I find that that a defense mechanism that's typically shielding Shane I'm not good enough or not you know I don't belong here that so you put up a guard around it that allows you to defense and mitigate the amount of shame that you can be subjected to an end any time I think this is why I think I think public speaking is like the

number to fear next to like dat right right and it's it's something that humans really kind of had confront ironically we're also extraordinarily social so yeah we need to interact with people we don't know we need to constantly have that but then putting us in front of a bunch of people the outcome you know our brain just is like you're about to be attacked by hold

these individuals so so yeah mass does come on I find that you need to understand yourself before that mass can be then kind of dissolved not necessarily remove but like fades back further and further until it's like well no this is it I'm comfortable with it and I'm actively trying to be better at life just anything I think when you start to understand and see that in

yourself then that that kind of mask that that bit of obfuscation of the real self versus what you want to present right can go away naturally and then people can accept you for you versus you having to deny you so that you can be accepted by the yeah so he's learning to love yourself yeah so that we others I love you it is kind of the way I summarize that well thank you very much

for taking the time to sit down and I agree she problem have it be

hi i'm mike with you tastic i'm here again at SCA some i'm sitting down with Corey for a quarry for he leads the development practice for eighth light in Florida but he has a long history of speaking and teaching I going back to well diamond blackberry days and you were consultant there but eighth light is really well engaged in the community or they make great efforts to be engaged

what is it that you're doing down in Florida to take what the culture is a fightin in Chicago to Florida so I think to answer that I may be stepping back a little bit of how i came to launch a florida office like they fight so my previous position i was doing a tremendous amount of traveling i did like 50,000 miles in january-february in two months enter montreal my a big

chocolate that wasn't was flights out of india and things like that but it was still a lot of travel and I her family and so we were trying to decide what the next step was going to be and I have spent a lot of time working with with organizations and I wanted to be in a position where I had the opportunity to influence the technical direction of it if I was going to go work for a product

company and so I did one of the craziest things I've ever done back in like november december i did around 21 interviews or 19 interviews in three days wha-what are you are used to travel well right so i flew out on a monday morning and went to Silicon Valley and spent two days there and I interviewed with like 11 companies and then I flew an overnight redeye to Chicago and

interviewed with five or six companies here and different people kind of exploring what was out there and the thing that i found was i was interested because it's passionate communities that are out that we hear a lot about Silicon Valley we hear a lot about Chicago and New York and austin in areas did for things like that and I wanted to go out there to say maybe I need to be a part

of this maybe there's something so amazing happening that I have to move my own family out here and what I found instead was a lot of smart people doing smart things there's no doubt about that but there was nothing that made me say a I have two be here I have to relocate my family and the second thing was I didn't see anything that said that we couldn't do something similar down in Tampa and

down in Florida are their challenges for sure there's challenges so it led me to say that what I actually thought my next step was going to be was launched a company down there and bring the practices and principles that I strongly believe in and the value systems of how I think company should be run to Florida so then in March early march in February early March I had a phone conversation

with Micah Martin and Paul pagal who won a fight and what we decided was in the cover i called them initially just to say how did you guys get started in that and instead of a phone conversation what we found was there's a lot of i'll use the word synergy right there's a lot of similar value systems between us and they were trying to figure out how to grow the company and was a geographical

growth a good next move for them and who would even do something like that and so so I kind of just sent me you guys ever thinking about opening a Florida off yeah they're like maybe we are thinking about that so so in March we launched the Florida office down there with just me and we're already up to six people and we're shooting for probably 10 by October I'm sorry by summer of next year

so what kind of our community things have you brought in what what do you identify is between yourself and 8th lights that you're taking on the Florida what are you what is it that you're doing down there so I think there's three key things I think first of all for the companies that are down there them an option that hasn't existed before they're in the Chicago area or in

a lot of other areas there are craftsmen shops that exists we don't see that as much down in Florida especially in the Tampa area that we're in so we're giving companies a chance to see there is a company which cares about craft there is a company which cares about delivering in value and those kinds of things secondly what we're giving is developers down there an opportunity to say there's

something other than just maintenance jobs or dot net jobs or Java jobs right there are companies who are out there who want a care about investing in you and and B are on the cutting edge of pushing what the technology stack looks like right and i think that the third thing that we're bringing is the opportunity to share with the broader community interesting topics that they

may not have otherwise heard of so for example we've already run some code retreats down there we a couple years ago I ran a day of Ruby event so it was a chance to have to teach people ruby on rails from scratch so we had over 90 people shop for that and so green though like another Ruby on Rails at Haskell one or laying no sequel those kinds of things we're going to be able to sponsor

those kinds of activities and opportunities down there for the product and it's something like that my next question was going to be his urban it seemed like what received as a rakan before but he said there was 90 people that came out for a first event that sounds like it was really well well received it was and that was a couple years ago before us before we started a

thigh down there but there is that hunger for as there is anywhere right there's not any time something new that people great developers are the kind of people who are interested in learning and when you give them the opportunities especially save opportunities to do that they they seem to really want a lot on to that and do you have any advice I mean because you're kind of going into

an area that didn't have an established or always I don't understand it at an established community do they were already user groups down there or very much so so it was a very large Mike soft community but there is a very active tablet Ruby users group out of Tampa I'll led by Jason freely and Gavin stark and they do a phenomenal job with it and they knowing them has been a

great asset saying there's a lot of support down there we do have some shops that are doing Ruby on Rails and their temper tend to be a little either very small boutique shops or broader larger corporations that people have brought that that concept in for example there's a company called well care which is a medical health insurance company come to become anything and there's a guy Brian

Nelson who brought who now is very involved with a go programming language but back then brought Ruby and rails into the middle of a dotnet shop so there's there are visionaries down there and what we're trying to do is push forward and say now there's a company down there who is practicing these principles and values as well so it's it's an opportunity to say this is an

example of a company that's doing while doing these things yes that's correct in it okay then you can come and learn from us that's right yeah it up um hey have you guys done anything like the aether universities that they do here in Chicago or is that something you're still trying to work out so it's both what we do right now is we haven't open in back to the community to come for a

thought University and we stream the Chicago 10 primarily because we're still small when we were growing that and we were trying to decide what we were going to do with it I think what we're going to start looking into next year is opening that up broader we're growing as a larger sized group as well so we'll be doing a mix of in-person plus streaming from the Chicago office do for somebody

that's maybe in an area it sounds like they did have a pretty robust community after all but if you're in an area and that maybe doesn't have a community if you you've been all over his there been any place where you could say throws this is right for community but they don't have something right now I would have you would have some advice for or how to start making something

happen in that area and so that that's a good question I think that there are places certainly here at the SEMA conference that brat I've talked to people who have very small user groups three or four people there plugging along with that and and what in fact i was speaking two nights ago with the guys who created or who started oh they're going to bother me up in

Wisconsin I the name completely escapes me for some reason and they talked about how it grew out of a community effort where they had a very small user group and then the advertised amitabh calm and I think that that's kind of the thing is people aren't going to go searching out necessarily for a ruby users group right it's in saying we're part of a broader technical group this might be something

you would want to be a part of the other thing that we see a lot of our bar camps right so far camps and code camp slow ceremony low ceremony things and tampa we just had a bar camp code camp they combined them and there was 1200 people who shut up for it which shows that there is a thriving community there and then it's how do we convert that so I think in smaller communities it's a

matter of getting the word out in ways that you might not expect people people may not search directly for a haskell users group right or rubios group doing looking at other users groups and doing presentations there so go into a dominant users group and saying hey let me show you what I Ruby looks like right I think it was two or three years ago I spoke at Microsoft's mix conference on

iron Ruby of all topics right right right in the heart of that of the Microsoft land and we've seen her shift and not because of my talking no we're seeing a shift in that right and so I think you're going to see people who are interested in mixing things up and combining efforts to to make interesting thing happened in smaller communities so that brings us to one of the

topics we talked about was talking to different types like Microsoft and this is in the slam on Marcus off it's just it's an observation that be a dominant developing she calls themselves the dominant developer a Java developer calls themselves a Java developer or I should say even I'm loaded in the word sir a person who works with dotnet primarily calls themselves a data

developer they start to identify with that platform a person who predominantly works with Java calls themselves a Java developer and pretend they identify with that but the software craftsmanship conferences are a little bit more polyglot a little bit we have people that do data we have people to do Ruby we have people that do all different things so you might ask me yes yeah and

it's it's a little more polyglot ish is it different when you've gone and spoken to a Microsoft oriented conference versus coming to like an STNA here well so I think to start off with its people identify with the groups they are out of necessity because those communities tend to reward people who integrate very tightly with those communities and they see a lot of benefits and rewards out of

them one of the things that is interesting about what is actually happening this weekend over s EA is if you listen to the different talks what people are finding is that by being influenced by other programming paradigms they're able to make their own code more pliable and cleaner and faster so i gave a talk yesterday morning on learning code and one of the things i

said was even within a code base you can have different dialects and that's what coding standards before but by looking at other paradigms we influence how well we're able to communicate in our base language so what the big thing that we're saying here is the influence of functional languages on object-oriented programming and and so so to your point I think that

yes there is a lot of insular culture for these conferences just like here at SAA we would probably not open our arms to somebody who was you know wanting to say I do waterfall all the time yeah at right and I don't do any tests and I'm awesome right there that's a natural part of what it is and I think you have to look at different things so it's not so much the community as the individual

and the my stance on craftsmanship is the responsibility of learning and growing is not on the company but it's on the individual and so you have to make that decision and have to see that value that by learning different languages and different paradigms you're going to be able to influence and become a better developer in your own language and in your own culture okay well thank

you very much for taking the time to go thank you very much

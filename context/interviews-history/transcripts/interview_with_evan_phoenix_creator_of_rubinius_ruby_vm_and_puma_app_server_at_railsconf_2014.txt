hi it's mike with you tastic i'm standing here with ivan Phoenix who is director with the Ruby Central and he's an organizer with the Rubicon and the rails comfortable right today I you might also know a little bit of his work inside of the Ruby communities one of the few people to consider actually created a ruby he created the Rubinius framework virtual machine and the puma

web server and probably tell us all the executive think up but it was pretty big fan but let's start with the conference of her outside first thank you for taking the time to speak sure my pleasure um so browse com yeah how did you get involved in uh in organizing sure yeah so I'm a director of the of Ruby central now and I got involved by basically being asked to do a buy and

read the previous directors by your Chad Fowler rich comer and David black so they they they asked me if I'd be interested in being a director they had they had done it since the beginning so since I'm gonna say 2004 and they had decided like well you know I can be nice to have some new people come in and so yeah so I said I would be great i was actually working on Sheldon helping them

out with ruby gem stuff photography and so they said okay let you obviously care about this stuff do you want to be more involved message sure so yeah so that kind of brought me and made me a director and then quickly I realized that oh ok we were these conferences now too right so yeah so it's a that's that's kind of how I got involved I was recruited and maybe well yeah so so I

mean he obviously didn't have that level of trust you were already very active in community at that point really up to you yeah but you were mostly working in open source of me like volunteering at conferences it was mostly in open source okay um you know I had certainly been to a lot of conferences I've been to plenty of rubyconf sand rails comps and regional conferences and international

ones at that point not helping out a time mostly because I end up speaking a lot of the Caucasus I don't really want I wouldn't have that be my focus not you know what I do now which is running around and making sure that the compliment going well coffee he could tell copy slightly is there enough coffee I know the Internet's down right I'll be right I let me look at it again

okay so yeah so I hadn't really been involved in the actual that volunteering and that kind of stuff but I certainly helped out so you know the Ruby conferences are you know very much a community affair so I'd been indicted you know those guys are my friends and they've been working on Ruby conferences and so occasionally I was like oh what do you help doing and I would help out

just doing whatever so it was fairly I was aware of the logistics right now wasn't that totally closed idea to me and you okay there's no so there's that and I got something when you move from being kind of in the code or just can help maybe set up and things like that hopefully and then be entrusted to an organization half right well I mean how much of a shock was that to your system

it wasn't too bad i mean i think that you know it we kind of we did a little bit at a time i think that the first big one the first thing we were like okay Wow was the 2011 railsconf it was the first one that O'Reilly was no longer partner with Ruby central on it and we we kind of like you know I wasn't really aware of I didn't this is my first time doing that conference and so there was a

lot of things that we were like oh my gosh we have no signage and it's two weeks before the conference so we're like do a bunch of signs i'm currently a teacher real fast to watch your t-shirts you know so that was a little it's a there's these times work it's very hectic and we've actually put a lot better with managing that kind of stuff now but it was a huge shock you know

it's in managing expectations is sort of what make a compra settled on right honestly having an open source project is a lot about managing other you users expectations like that thing so it's not totally dissimilar yeah it has a change your perspective about running and organizing hasn't really changed if you go to other conferences and do you look at them Mulder familiar

oh yeah it you one thing that we organizers we were talking about is whether that we feel like the conference has gone well right that's a thing we're constantly asking ourselves and ask each other I know things going okay that kind of stuff and it's funny we can't our opinion is actually really bad on whether or not it's going well because we only see the warts we only see the

stuff that doesn't work because that's the stuff that gets brought to our attention the stuff that does work really well people like oh that was great they don't we don't really hear about that kind of stuff so we should like go ask people's opinions how's the conference going I think that so now when I go to other conferences and I see what's going on I'm much more attuned to

like ok they're having a problem I can tell the way that they're acting oh there's a problem over here and the deal with it but I can tell the guys never learn sympathy exacting wasn't very good yeah and the other thing is um look at in a false project where you're you're working you've got the people complaining and most probably heard of the month sir most in your face I mean

you're working on a project that's it's very very visible and then every time something gets frustrated like I'm not yeah this thing before girl yeah yeah I know so you might feel a little bit more yep working in open source you may be developed a little thicker skin oh sure I'm sure absolutely yeah so you're going to look at it a little bit more in context yeah it doesn't really get you

know when people say like oh this doesn't work or whatever it doesn't get to me I mean like I'm interested I want to know like because I want them to be happy and I want to know why it doesn't work like what's the exact circumstances but over time I've I love myself not to for my emotional state to not be flexion of those other those other people's emotional states so that when they're

mad it doesn't make me mad I just going ok I understand that that's the problem you know we gotta help them fix it but I don't get all riled up about it when like even I type chatted with the HH and Aaron Patterson about knowing that you have a proud that people might be sticking their career you know that corazon no absolutely didn t job yeah huh you know

how does that sum cuz we've got a sec wait here because if I'm not really I diga you know knowing that you've created something that many people are paying the bills with him and I mean every work and then does that ever when you or visit her set um it doesn't I don't think it doesn't really weigh on me I think that more it's exciting for me more than anything else that you know

like we have a because i think that i think if if people didn't sceptile weren't so admin telling us that we they felt like the conference's remote well i think it would wear me a lot more but i think that the fact that people feel people come up and tell us that the conference is going well there's all these great talks and that kind of thing and all right somebody somebody tell

marty is one of the directors say like you need to pick not such great tracks and put them all together at same time because i can't figure out was talks to go yeah that's a good problem right when we hear that you know that that kind of means oh there's kind of always going to be problems but when we hear that from a lot of people the way of knowing that like you know we have a duty if you will

is it's big it's an energizing it's a bigger any more than that's important because we know that like you know we can help we can help makes a community better and keep it sort of size and keep it going and that will make that will allow other companies just to do more rails projects and the people at our conferences will get those jobs and you know so i think it's more like we're

happy that it's that it's going as well as it is and you know thinking about people who are critical yes sometimes the loudest usually i was always the curriculums are the most loving and I just again moving towards the open source stuff yeah because you're in a unique position to have something that some people view are you actually a few products that people might look as

competitive sure so Rubinius competitive to gymboree competitive to MRI for who mark additive to drop unicorn well that's the big one thin sure you know but drop in so that's a unique perspective and I'd like to ask about it yeah you know how do you feel about looking at jruby and I'm sure yeah I think that it's funny that they're the working or forbidding as for as long as

I have that was a big question or that's always been a big question you know like are you God do you guys fight a lot even though like a dare you mean to each other and I think that within the Rubinius J would we like eaten all of the Ruby implementations even the ones that are much smaller race isn't huge but I'll leave the ones that are much smaller those are all of those everybody

is very we're all like comments we're all very we're all friends we all talk about what's going on because we all have different things to bring to the table we're not building exactly the same thing and so that allows us to do that allows us to sort of be friends talk about solutions how are you solving this other thing yeah i think is that it's good that we're friends because it

would be kind of lonely otherwise right there's not a lot of people doing that work you really want to have somebody else to talk to let's go speak to me I think that's exactly right that's exactly what you're talking to right and so if we were you know if we if we weren't friends if everything was like a constant butting of heads then it would be yeah it would be this very isolating

thing but because they're all sort of yeah like I said we're all friends so that makes it better so it when people that is it it's never like John you just want people to stop doing these comparisons are or do you thing or is another volley like sleep you can wade through such yeah I think if the people stop through the comparisons then there's probably not option prime means

only one thing right and so that you want the comparisons because it means that people are looking at them and they're saying okay well should I choose this one I should I choose this one and what does this give me that that doesn't give me one of the trade-offs and I think that you always even have the comparison you want to compare I mean you know there's a million

different cars out there and that's all people do is compare cars which car should i get that guy's right and you want that all the car companies won't comparisons because it means that they're they're looking at their better yeah but it means that there's sort of a healthy ecosystem of choice for those things and then in that you can figure out how to compete on features

absolutely yeah you want and you want to compete on the things that matter for the users you don't to compete on like sabotage us or the project you would have your users say okay we really love something like this and you say like okay well I'll go ad that for you or whatever might be that's that's where you want to compete you want to say like okay we're giving people what they want

and that's you know who could give that the best or the version of it that it goes some subset of users want the most or whatever so so you know and again as I the colors are fascinating in the reason I'm so excited to talk about with any assistant we're here about Ruby and that's that sir and it is Ruby something I also just want to also understand about how you your path to creating a vm

sure not just the Ruby specific on that was that your first implementation of something like this um well okay so rubios is actually on its it's currently 24 virtual machines cuts cotton gin in addition to the normal vector machine but it's really the third code base for the same project okay so the first to the first one okay well I'll go back to the beginning so I got

involved with doing it because I was always liked like languages and virtual machines I thought that was very interesting part in computing because it's like this building block if you can make it really good as you can make it really sound and interesting then you can build anything on top of it right and so I started off I was just kind of interested in and friend of mine Ryan

Davis said suggested that I get the small talk blue book which is the sort of canonical book that the second half of it is just a reference for how to build a small talk virtual machine oh and it was the it was a reference for a machine that they never built someone actually has translated it squeak was actually a translation of that saying it actually but it was just a guess it was

for documentation it was like okay well this is how you do this and all the documentation was so wanting to be like it's a documentation of something you're saying that doesn't exist yeah they never they never use the code that's in fact there's all these there's all these typos and i'll be in the code itself which is fine you know but it's all written in small talk as well so they

they didn't have small factor right to run this thing because they wrote it in small talk so of course there was just for a documentation so so I got that and I was like okay it's so easy like I can read the thing and I feel like okay this is what this is what the bytecode looks like the society dispatch the bytecode this is how any called method what would you do so I really just translated the

blue book into my own virtual machine I wrote all in Ruby so the first version or bidding as it's actually the first 50 commence or something in the git repository go back and look at it it's alimentation the small talk vm it was for Ruby but it was for roommate basically the techniques the exact ideas that were in the small talk about for Ruby but it didn't run very much I mean

it was like it had its own it did have a very simple garbage collector it had a bytecode virtual machine it was super super slow because I was there in Ruby and she's running it on 182 if it was the Ruby at the time so I did that and then I I was very interesting and then I got accepted to talk about at rubyconf Denver 2006 no yeah 2062 the town i can't i can't remember anyway so

and I realized that I couldn't pretend this thing that was just all Ruby and super super solo people really like oh this is very cool how can I use it I me like you can't use it all I suggest you never use this that would be really kind of a bummer so I translated it into seat just like hand translated read the Ruby wrote to see revenue growth to see and so that was the first version of a verb

Aeneas that was that you could sort of general you could sort of use it was still pretty slow and we kind of built up techniques and we did a compound stuff on top of it and tell about 2008 okay nine and we translate it into c plus plus we changed a bunch of things we did that so that's it's been it was Ruby and Ruby and then Ruby and see and then Ruby in C++ right ok so it's an

awful what's nicer culture yeah I'm not yet yes it off yeah woody PL version that be fun enough it's one long line yeah okay so you're obviously you know very passionate about previous leads concurrent I mean I'm multi-threaded vm yeah any MP powers are looking at ruby and say well its got the GL go global interpreter lock yeah um and you know that idea for processes but look at

JRuby and Rubinius yeah so now you're you know you're actually in a way going head-to-head with Java yeah really haha no absolutely no chance you know it's so scary yeah yeah yeah if you start crying that's okay I appreciate it you know I mean it's a huge mega corporation but um so you know it's pretty obviously your passion about creating performance tools that we can Institute very funny

codon in 2014 if im looking at Rubinius can i look and say yeah I should maybe look at this and try to see what I can do with it maybe look at my production systems absolutely a benefit absolutely i mean i think that there are so places that is slower then even MRI owes a lot of real code that does things that kind of confuse the the JIT compiler but I we have we have users that use obedience

for very specific workloads because they control enough of it that they can basically make it they never become an extremely fast inside we're begging us feel like high frequency traders or people who run workers with just like the background workers times people run background workers with Rubinius that are running inside rails and they're doing something that's like okay well

I'm gonna go off and do this with this big calculation whatever I want to do if I do that in readiness and it's super fast and again there's sort of a kind of get the best of both worlds and that way and that because it's funny much x we can actually it's might come as a surprise but we can actually run other stuff I'm Ruby not just rails right be right exactly that's exactly right yeah

yeah I he did say something know that I want to talk on t-shirt with I asked this question of ehh earlier about you know C is openly critical of certain companies sure that's it you know just so happen to use rails and make a lot of money with it and then you mentioned have frequency traders with our controversial sure sure um you know I don't know what your feelings are

regarding high-frequency trading but knowing that your tools are getting used to basically by peoples Islands sir but they're not necessarily giving anything back okay you know what what are your thoughts regarding yeah i think that you know going in when i was right would I serve riding a vm I thought about this actually I was like okay I've been right

if I really want to do this and but this is true for almost any job this is not just true for a ruby implementation you give away you don't yeah absolutely for a job I got a paycheck yeah yes it I think that you you go into it saying that like you know the if my license is such a way that I want I want people to use this independent of whether or not i agree with the way that they're using it

you have to come in like sort of you know the fortunes are kind of check that at the door right you have to say like look there's always going to be those people who are kind of do something with it that you don't that you would not do with it right that doesn't mean that your thing is not good and that you should not do that because also I might use it in a bad way it's not a nuclear

weapon it's not new you know that kind of thing it's just some software if you don't do it somebody else will do it it's not like this is vacuum of software out there so I think that I kind of come to the conclusion that it doesn't I can't have no controller for that right I have no control over what how people are going to use it what they're going to use it for whether or not i agree

with what they use it for and so I can't really allow myself to worry about that yeah that's just like that's the world that's going to happen but socko's and interest a funny anecdote inside I had a our friend friend who's was listening to a Senate Judiciary hearing lie against some company for a company he worked with and they were haven't explained their algorithm and he's sitting or

watch me he's with his daughter and he says daddy want that it's amazing yeah Danny and he's listening to these people talk about this anti-monopoly you know I'm not gonna say yeah yeah thats awesome ate the other is you purchasing in a team of hearing about you know like i said th complaining or common commenting on certain companies and you mentioned that frequency trading it

this stuff can get you some ways that may be hard until I paid a fun you courage as a loving yeah I mean I think for me I think there's a way that I the way that I come in terms with it is just to think that if if I'm making my users happy whatever they do with it I sort of that's fine weather I again I can't control that but I still want to I still unfolding I hold myself into the users

who weren't this thing you know so I'm going to use it to Bobby user as well but those people's opinions matter as well so I wanna if they're happy with what's going on than that i'm fine with it and I have to just sort of end there I can't get into the deeper what what are they actually doing with it I can't I can't do that so sorry and you know just coming back to the conference 2014

is wrapping up I mean or not I'm 14 and Java the rails comp 114 is wrecking out today are there already plans for what's next door so we had a Chicago you've all over yeah so we've got roof gutter becomes in November coming up that's in San Diego okay and then we have railsconf 2015 which we're going to announce the location for the keynote this afternoon great and then yeah we

get a small and wallets yeah oh yeah yeah we're going everything's good you know I think that people past us you know like Oh could convey bigger is the conference going ok and you know we sell out that we sell out both conferences at every year in rails comp only sells out a couple weeks before the conference actually starts that actually tells us that we're probably exactly the right

size ok as I make it worth selling if it worth something out we know that we're probably buying them yeah we're too little today if we sold out too early maybe we're too small but what kind of where we are kind of in this sweet spot I think and a lot of new people at this year's comp which is super super important we know the community is healthy we know that there's new people

coming in you know at some point I've told this other people at some point there will be a decline I don't know when that's going to occur I don't want it looks like but I know that having new people come in be in the community be at the conference's will delay that decline all the time so it might come someday but it's well I've actually there was going to be the heat death of the amber

not not not this year not right alright well thank you from absolutely my pleasure appreciate it sure user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you casa calm you

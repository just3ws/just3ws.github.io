hi I'm Mike again at Chicago web conf I'm sitting down with JC groves she's one of the lead organizers at Chicago comp and well thank you for taking the time to sit down with me sure can you tell me a little bit about what your what the Chicago web conf is sure so this is our is our second year it's basically kind of a conference focused on anything in the front end okay so

front-end web development more of your back cvy yeah so it covers everything from user experience and design the cover you know all the kind of designing side of things but also technology so html5 and css3 and JavaScript and all kinds of javascript libraries we had a guy this morning talking about porting no packages to run in the browser so it's really about everything that runs

in the browser wait so you know I know you your developer on the front and then the bank and you've been to conferences that are maybe more our specky like from the rails conferences where to talk more about you back end well r-spec will be just a back in town because of it but how might you compare a more back end application development kind of conference to what you're doing here

with the UI and front-end sure it's an interesting mix so the first thing is you know sort of everyone has to deal with the front end right so whether you're a Java developer or a ruby developer everyone has to go with the browser so from an audience perspective if we get a really broad range of people that come from all kinds of different different backgrounds the other

interesting thing is that we have both the design and ux component and a technical technical component which brings another layer of mixed to it and you have designer types and developer types kind of getting together which doesn't happen in a lot of conferences reading it from my experience so it's a it's kind of a melting pot yeah and you have you have a multi track event going

there's 33 x given and do you try to like say one track is for designers one track is for dads well this year we were a little constrained in the space so we try to keep a good mix of the tube we want people to have options and if developer wants to stay in the sort of developer focused on a sessions that we try to not overlap them as much as possible but but there's pretty much a

mix of the two going on at any one point in the day so and from our experience last year a lot of people cross over so there's a lot of developers that go to design aux tracks and vice versa yeah that was funny max question is is do you see a lot of cross-pollination and in the audience you have this big kind of open area where in 1871 which is a big open workspace so you have lots of you

have a lot of Halloween interaction have you made any plans with the scheduling too yes so we have made sure we have a good 10 minute block between each session and then there's an hour for lunch obviously so that we a lot of networking time there there's a 30 minute break in the afternoon which we intentionally wanted to do just to break the day out but also to give people in

England England time that was something that people asked last year they really liked the time that they had to interact with everybody yeah and then at the end of the day we have an after party which is also going to be here from 7pm to whatever so when the kid whatever if you want to stop drinking up and and so yeah there's tons of networking time so content and and meeting new friends is

like the big thing that people go to conference as far as far as I'm concerned and one thing that I've notice here versus some other conferences it has come up in some of the conversations I've had with people is that there is a looks like to me a better representation of female attendees and minority attendees is that something that do you think that was an

intentional did you reach out to different groups or so it was kind of a happy surprise honestly so this year we did pursue some presenters some female presenters that you know i have come across throughout the year and i really wanted to have at the conference but as far as attendees go we just kind of threw the doors open and i think with you know the sort of melting pot effect

that I sake about before I think that kind of draws all different different folks so yeah I've been really really happy with the yeah yeah it's nice to see ya since you see a nice variety of people that's very representative of a population not just one roll call to you well thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me absolutely appreciate it

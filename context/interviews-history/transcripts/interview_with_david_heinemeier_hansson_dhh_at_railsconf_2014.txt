user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations popera of information find out for yourself today at you classic calm hi it's Mike d'you tastic I'm here at railsconf 2014 and I'm standing here with thh David Hannum on Hanson if you might know him he's written a few books

done a few stuff I think you have something to do with the product that we did for the conference about uh but we're going to talk about his keynote that he just gave about its clarity and right being a software writer well first of all I'll say thank you very much for taking the time to talk with me sure um so your key no what what was the gist of what you were trying to communicate sure

so I think the identity of most programmers are coming from an angle that doesn't fit the development of information technology very well anymore and that angle is software engineer I think there's a lot of programmers who create information systems where engineering is actually not the primary thing that they do what they do is they write their software writers they're

trying to achieve a level of clarity figuring out first of all what I think building mm-hmm it's not like a bridge where you just know well it needs to go from there to work there and we need to have the structural bearing and so on and so forth a lot of systems are very vaguely defined right so figuring out what you want to build is very much like figuring out what you want to say right

it's more elastic than just go from here to there it is it's not fussy and it's not a subjective it's a much more subjective endeavor and I find that writing is much better metaphor than engineering and within that I find that one of the main ways that people are driving their development right now is TDD test-driven development and I've just I used to be a big fan and I used

to be a big fan because it sounded like it made a lot to be great when I found over the years is that the test first approach driving your design through two tests actually doesn't make that much sense to me and I found that a lot of other software that I looked at and discussed with people who sort of that was created through the test first the paradigm wasn't better it

was worse and what's interesting though is it seems like rails was very early on in in the whole test-driven development and putting that out there and even introducing it as a concept but now ten years later you you're feeling like you're backing away from that original yeah so so I think rails was probably the first framework that just had a test

by default we got a place to put the tough we generated them through the scaffolds per default I think there's still a lot of good today it's not the tests are bad I think I can't imagine building a modern application today without testing and I have automated tests you're really in the woods but I don't find it as a the primary objective of my design discipline getting more

nuanced thing it's more noise than that and mostly it's just test first worked for me for a tiny majority of the cases of what I do and for a majority of the cases test first especially when focused on the unit instead of the whole system actually ends up creating more problems that dissolves okay and like I was saying it sounds like you've developed a more

nuanced approach and it seems like some of the interactions with people in the community is a little bit more dogmatic one way or the other other people are kind of taking Ricky stance a fact test-driven development that's silly and then there's the other side that the Bob Martin camp which is clean code you even kind of add a little a little shot with the dirty code there is slide but you

know listening to the to your conversation in person versus observing conversations online it sounds like some of that meaning that nuance is it gets lost sometimes sure I mean anything on Twitter it's bored of nuance you have a hundred forty characters do anything you could put out as absolutes

yeah and they could mean be influential influential and sort of starting the discussion and driving it it won't get it all the new on so you you have to go deeper than just 140 characters of course I think the ping-pong helped me crystallize my thoughts on an event and the ping-pong victory for people who don't know was sort of people submitting a piece of code I did that on and hacker

news a few times in there some guys set up a site for it and we wind over where this code could go like we agreed that the original piece of code was bad and then people would ping pong on it some people would then say oh well the code is bad because the pattern and the rooms not testable or whatever and I would try to go in a different direction where where ever I

applied this ping pong he was about Clara dude I'm gonna make this code clearer simpler easier to understand or conceptual overhead all these things right and if I don't end it up in a very different spell right that's what partly helped me informed is that we are going in different directions you end up somewhere else when you go through test first then when you go through clarity

first I don't want to call it that because there's something I want to have to hurt anything like clarity ridiculous well I talked to Dan Northman it's the same kind of thing where they start with an idea and then it becomes Dogma by other people who adopt it yes once I have that rigid I think that's what the I had a quote by Kent back that's incredibly reasonable talks about sort

of confidence levels in new code more so than just talking about well every piece of code needs to be written with a test failing first and I think it's just not I don't know if it's not realistic because I'm sure it's the the real stuff for somebody it's certainly not realistic for me it's not the real for me and it doesn't arrive at something better I try very hard and

multiple times and I didn't find that it took me to a good place and the one thing I see with the ping pong is at least it gives concrete a and B destined to be talked about and reason about yes before after code is is I'm really a big fan of that because it crystallizes a lot of our codes that are otherwise very fluffy it's very easy to talk about these things in the abstract

I think clarity it's almost impossible to talk about in the abstract because everybody agrees yes of course we should have fear code yeah it's not controversial term but when you apply it to an actual piece of code then it quite quickly can become country okay okay so you know I wanted to ask a few questions sure some people have contributed ideas for topics yeah one of those was about

just your experience releasing rails as a major project and then it gets used by companies and make billions of dollars sure ah but they don't always give back even a fraction of what they yeah how how have you dumped it I mean it doesn't sound like you're doing too shabby but sure it doesn't show no and I don't need to and it doesn't bother me at all actually there are a lot of people who

do feel like well their own something because they contribute to open source I think that's an unfortunate perspective to have on what you're doing if you're doing it for external reasons and external rewards that's not what I'm doing it I'm doing it for my own reward a big part of my own rewards just I enjoyed it right I'm not doing it for somebody else too so if landing pay day

out of it and I enjoy sharing it and a side effect of sharing it freely letting people use it like they want to like I would want to use anything is that something we could choose to use it to build great things that are of great value and I don't see any of that okay I mean I think it's a that's where open-source like I'm a big proponent of open source but there's also their

society but it's always that I'm not that enthusiastic about and GPL to some extent is that side of it I am not that enthusiastic about roping people into half to I dip donate code or money or whatever just because you use something that doesn't appeal to me especially on the code part I don't want the code of somebody who doesn't want to give it like that's gonna be my perspective

partner very good code um it's it's somewhat like I don't care if somebody sends it if I need something in rails I don't have already helped build it my damn self right and you don't actually that since you're brought up that the the GPL that was gonna cover another question but I do you want to ask about so open rails is open source and many libraries are

that are used by it well all of the libraries right are also part of rails or open source sharing omakase selected gems but rails itself that's a trademark yeah I didn't think well this just now is that there there is a there does seem to be aligned between the codes out there and you can use it but right the brands itself is that helped keep rails on the rails

I think it helps keeps rails being is one thing it's very easy to to that do that in the early days we had a lot of people actually calling their frameworks in other languages where else and that's not a great thing like I'm making rails with a certain omission with a certain approach to it and I want people to be able to know what that is right I don't want people to pick something

else up that says rails they think it's something that I made and then it's some PHP framework that I really wouldn't want to touch with a ten-foot pole right so I think trademarks are good in sort of removing confusion so I mean that's what they're there for right they're there for just it like a certain company or a certain product

they could be that thing right but coca-cola can sell to their colon it's called coca-cola and somebody else can't sell their cold I'm call it coca-cola because it's been somewhat confused I think there's great value in that you can certainly go overboard and people do that all the time and some of that is unfortunately part of what trademark law you have to sort of

enforce it otherwise you lose it that's tricky to keep that it is it is it is some people off yeah for me the whole thing about even where else is a trade one was just to avoiding that confusion not to avoiding people like I don't want somebody to be representing like the official rails if it's not something that I believe in because that's gonna reflect poorly on

me so that's the reason we have it we haven't really used it for anything else it isn't this incredibly little economic value being derived from it it's protecting what rails is yeah okay and another question that you know we talked about the GPL but what are your feelings for companies whose business practices you don't necessarily agree with though using your products using rails to me

it's like I'm also paying my taxes and though some of those taxes go to paper oats and some people who are driving those roads I don't agree with so what like it really doesn't matter I can completely distinguish between sorts the technical aspects of what somebody's doing and then there are other wise business practices so to me there's there's definitely no sort of conflict

in calling out companies who I think have poor business practices whether they usually breath enough yeah though I mean when they come on they say over a rail shop and they're like I wish you didn't say that you know yeah I I do to me and like where else is open to us at MIT you can take it you can do whatever you want with it

I'm not responsible for anybody uses routes what they do with it with the individual members of sort of the rails community I don't want that police role this is not a hierarchy in that sense it's not like somebody uses rails my employee and I have to be responsible for anything they say on behalf of rails just because somebody uses rails doesn't mean that they're expressing thoughts on

behalf of me that's not how this is that's explicitly why this is MIT take and do whatever you want with it like no strings attached right because then there's not that obligation for me to police everybody who use this and how they use this in it or whether they're good people and they're bad people or whatever it's just not it's a separate thing and I don't want that as being

part of the what comes into Russ but it's enough sort of on my shoulders just to run rails as the vision of the framework and so on if I also had to be responsible for anybody chooses to use it at what they do okay and the last one that's a little bit more of a fun question in relative to the theme of you tastic and that was drink you know even you mentioned going as a child to see

our young man and boy to see the gathering right up but you're just to go back in time to when you first were extracting rails from the frame from basic amplifier yep I I got nervous and I was I'm sure one thing but when you're first extracting it you wanted to show it to people you want to get people to to look at it and check it out maybe go into user groups what was the first

other user group or conference you presented rails what was the reception yeah I think I actually first showed it up to supress working at a food companies interesting not a whole lot of feedback to it and then I showed it off at a Danish University and at the university itself I don't know I'm 30 people there 40 people yeah people were interested but it was

like getting the video up that really made people interested in getting it online just meeting with a local group of people didn't really do that much in the beginning where I found like-minded people were all over here that yeah I posted a video and somebody was like oh they broke me and like focus really interesting to learn more about this on that at that time I was also on the the

Ruby mailing list they were I was participating a fair amount than that and we're talking on their IRC everson IRC so for me it was always about the virtual groups not so much about meeting in person even though that's great - I mean that's what we're doing here at railsconf 1,500 people it's great to do that occasionally yeah but the bulk of the so real work

happens remotely evidence for people just working for wherever they are because they you don't get the the rails core group and the alumni group they're from all over the place great different all sorts of different countries and different cities and so forth and not if I just had to run rails just out of the programmers available in Copenhagen I mean no offense to opening but of course

it would be it's good right like having the whole world work on something versus having one city one tiny country work on something right not same thing and I I remember that video coming out because I was actually a Microsoft developer at the time and I didn't like it right but I might add that one of my life my career options were limited I just remember thinking that's cool I want to

look at that somebody no idea so yeah break out of it I appreciate the creation and the work and um it's very nice um oh no I know I know I gosh didn't I for it was insane but I'm not can I just want to think you know you this should have to go thank you for my pleasure absolute the time thank you for putting this up there thanks love

talking about it alright thanks everyone user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today that you classic calm

hi it's Mike again with you tastic I'm sitting down with Sam sir foosh is who's a developer who is from Iran and now he's working here in the States as a graduate student he's doing some consulting excuse me graduate assistant and he's doing some consulting thanks for taking the time to sit down with me Sam thank you so much for angry the time like has appreciated so you know I'm not

not to single you out again but we bumped into each other at SCA and you had a very interesting story that you've moved here from Iran in like we were kind of discussing earlier here in the United States and I'm sure in you know in Europe Iran is in in the news lap but we don't hear about people and community and tuck in Iran as well so can you tell me a little bit about what it was like

being a developer back in Iran well actually I was doing my undergraduate studies in software engineering you know one of the greatest universities in your own code shade bishnu university and during that time I started working with one of my friends as this programmer in a very small company and to be honest that company was not very good and you know it wasn't very satisfying for me so

I talked to my friend and told him that you know what the things that they're doing here is not very professional and I don't think I can stay here anymore so he told me that I had this friend and they started you know kind of in a startup company and they're doing something cool named agile and extreme programming and I told and okay that sounds interesting and it was like three

or three and a half years ago I guess or maybe four years ago and I said okay this sounds interesting to me I really really like to participate with them and started working with them and I did a couple of interviews with them and they accepted me as a programmer there I started as a programmer over there like three years ago and when I was leaving fortunately I was like programming coach

and the technical consultant over there so I managed to have a good progress because i was working with them like 20 47 on different projects and learning from different aspects of agile and you know extreme programming principles practices and you know all those and interesting stuff like test-driven development and anything and that was the start point

for me to see what is agile and that that interests me so well so it's been like three years now and I'm still much more enthusiast about those ideas what was her how did you go about getting information and support I reserve just your friends right the university over the user groups or anything like that well and the first introduction was through one of my friends as I told you

before and when we get there the only resource for us was the internet and to be honest the speed of the internet in Iran is nothing compared to here I know it's like very hard for us to have like you know to watch lectures online or all those kinds of you know more and heavier stuff on the internet so but we had an access to some books and like screencast and online lectures and all those kinds

of stuff but it wasn't easy like just give you the tip of the iceberg we couldn't even buy books from Amazon from Iran because they don't provide the services in Iran so the way we did it and we found someone in the u.s. we had to trust him we got the paychecks and then we paid the guy more and especially because of these sanctions and diplomatic issues and you know the

currency in Iran reduced dramatically so a forty-dollar book is huge expensive in run for us to buy that and but but we did it anyway so and also we had to pay extra again for shipping that book from the u.s. to Iran so that was just for gaining access to some books on software development principles and practices and we did it and also the same story again with your screencasts and all those

kinds of stuff so it wasn't easy but fortunately I was working with people that you know they were all passionate like me about these ideas and they really enjoying what they're doing so we liked it and we did it anyway but it's nothing compared to be here in the community because to my knowledge they learned that much of the extreme programming and agile going on in Iran

like we were almost like maybe maybe in the whole country you can find like 100 or 200 people that doing these things so passionately and the bad thing is you don't have any kind of community that you go you know gather around you know having conversation and presentation all those kinds of stuff that are going on here all the time even in the smallest cities and but we didn't

have something like that over there so we were almost on our own you know and also the Internet resources which I told you it wasn't easy to use what's are there any issues with with accessing things that might have been censored or because I know that there's some you know yeah there's news reports a bit there are there are filtering this stuff on the internet but and fortunately I

don't think we hit that issue in the scientific and technical stuff that you were you know looking for maybe sometimes if they were like is some kind of a blog or article that has mixed content both political and technical or scientific stuff which you can find sometimes maybe in those scenarios we had to use like you know filter break yourself or stuff like that but for the

rest of the part I don't think so because they didn't filter like technical and scientific issues they mostly you know filter like political issues okay and and what what brought you here to the States I mean it sounds obvious but what is your yell states to learn and study how to gin up coming here yeah well and that's actually an interesting story well it was like two

and a half years ago and I was working with this team and you know we were doing a lot of practicing and reading all the time but but you know it hit me at that moment that in order to move so much faster and learn a lot you need to be in the same room with a good community and all the people that are doing this very professionally and so much more passionate because to be

honest the company that I was working or the software team that was working with there are good people and they were passionate but you know not as much as me you know what I mean like I was crazy about these things but they were like normal and that's the main reason so it hit me that I really need to come here and be in the community because at that time I was following all these

professional people in the tutor and you know reading all their articles all their books and watching all their lectures for example on kabob I read all of his books I read all of these articles and watched all of these lectures as much as possible and a lot of other people but then I don't want to mention all the names of course because it takes like one hour at least but yeah

that was what I was doing but I I thought that if i'll be there and participate in these conferences communities and these programming sessions with other people learn from their experience because i'm in the beginning of the journey it's like my third year and it's nothing compared to people with 10 years or 15 years of experience and it's it's a long journey

and i'm in the beginning so i need to learn from those people and that's the main reason that I decided to come here and be in the community so I posted in the agile testing mailing list this is me and I've been doing these things and this is my goal I want to do these things and I want to apply for my graduate studies to a university in the United States and since I'm an

enthusiast person in the agile and XPS stuff what are your suggestions one of the people responded to me was mr. Matt oyster which is a software testing consultant and he's a great person he told me I went to gvsu which is grand valley state university in Grand Rapids Michigan I got my masters in computer information systems from there and you can find a couple of professors who are

interested in the agile and software development efficient and effective you know development techniques and practices so I thought that sounds really interesting to me and I applied here unfortunately I got the admission and mr. heuser helped me wrote a recommendation letter for me after a couple of interviews that he did with me through the skype and I got the

admission and I came here and to be honest since I got here it is so much easier to learn and move because i order a boot from amazon two days later it's in front of my door alright took me like two months before when I was in Iran you know what I mean so and a lot of other stuff like as you mentioned we bumped into each other at SCA there's no such thing there

that was a great experience for me I met a lot of people and learn a lot from them and I took a lot of good advice from professional people about like how I should continue this path or are the things that you should consider so that was just like gist of what brought me here and I how I got here so after after you're done with your your masters are you planning on going back home and

taking some of the community ideas and maybe starting a conference back in Iran or anything well to be honest I haven't decided yet they're friendly but probably I stay in the United States and continue working with professional people but I definitely and will write about these things as much as I can because I have a personal blog and I've been doing it even in the past few years

and i will definitely you know arrange some online meetings with the people that I know they are passionate about these things and tell them what are the things that they should do and start a community like here even if it's really a small better than nothing and I started fighting people and hang out and give presentation about what are the things that they're going you know

through in their projects and all those kinds of stuff because when I was back in Iran and you know I managed a couple of workshops and test driven development kind of like a code retreated stylist staff over there and also I gave a lot of presentation to students of the University and also a couple of sulphur teams to developers about these new techniques and better ways of developing

sulfur and the programming session with bunch of them as a you know just to tell them that these are the better ways to develop sulfur and there are you know being used in most of the you know good development companies so I tried to do these things when i was there and i will definitely continue that probably remove the three described and we people that are doing these things in your own steel

ok and i'm just curious up what what what kind of uh was it when you were back in Iran what were you guys working on Alyssa Dom not not actually what you were working but we working with free and open source software or we working both of us about that company that i told you about we were using mostly two monitors of technologies that goes a c-sharp but the developer and designer

over there but we also working on some rails projects with another team and I have a couple of friends that they are working in a company right now that they are doing fully rails of stuff and but at that time I was doing below because I was doing a little bit of rails development with some of my friends on project and also most of the things that

I was doing in that cell for team that i told you about was in C sharp nails feet and with Microsoft okay cool well thank you again for taking the time to sit down with me and talk about your experiences thank you so much for giving me the opportunity I really appreciate it sure

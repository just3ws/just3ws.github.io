hi i'm mike with you Tess I'm here scn a software craftsmanship North America it's a mouthful but saw sitting down with Mike Jansen who runs the a thought University at eight light here in Chicago hi Mike thanks for sitting down Thanks ah what is this a flight University so a plate university is it's a every Friday event that we have over lunch at the eight light office in

Chicago and it is a chance for our craftsmen to basically kind of give back to the other craftsmen working a play and also to the community a large house to say is that it in-house only thing so it started out as you know back when they fled was maybe six or seven people we started doing you know sessions every Friday where it was kind of a lunch and learn then they got a little more

formalized and we want to do everyone to do three sessions on some topic so not just your typical one-hour session on something but a really much like a deeper dive okay into some topic about software development or something interesting that are they working on but these were people that were working at a flying yet so are you working prentices and yeah yeah so very small start but as

we start to move down the Chicago area instead of just being at the liberty bill we really started opening up the other university to the public okay so we started a self the rsvps major peels have come in we were lunch everyone and so now at our new office we've got a little more capacity we're up to about 60 people on a regular basis coming in for 80 you on Fridays and now and it's

so it's a little bit out of the education the social aspect is not they come in and it's a class it's yeah it's more like let me count phones should you say a little bit so it's it really works as a way to to get people that are just finding out of youth life you know are looking for an apprenticeship or you know there's some eerie and they want to come in

something you know that it's a chance for them to stop but I have some lunch and learn about whatever whatever topic is coming up and those topics can really arrange all over the place so was I if I University your first kind of foray into organizing community or probably my first formal yeah you know I you know past jobs i would organize it with mini training sessions that sort of thing so

i really felt like kind of natural fit when i got started late flight of oh I can I can do this I can I can get people to you know get up and talk yeah so and then it's really just I mean the the people that I work with that a flight Susan and Angelique they're both real good I hoping to make sure all the all of the bits and pieces all the details get taken care of it also helps having

an army of apprentices like yeah pictures before it's my minions yes exactly so I and our the recording do you publish an army yeah we we post the videos on vimeo we have in your account and we put the links up to the videos on our website university like calm okay I'm just going to be the next question yes the high-tech comment okay and so it takes a little bit of time just to

process and upload them so they may be a week or two behind most the time but you can find a lot of our videos there okay for you know the past maybe year or so of talks is there been any like highlight talks and we're really like yeah this is this was fun yeah so every about once a quarter we have Uncle Bob Martin come in and he does a talk I usually don't find out until maybe three

days beforehand so i just kind of say alright Uncle Bob's coming on friday you know and then people RSVP right away for it so those those are always a lot of fun we've had some good ones we have one that's on one of our craftsmen get on the go language and that was really interesting just to kind of see it's not a language that really is used much outside of

Google and so he was really passionate about it and really got people kind of very interested in trying out go and see how it would work for one of their process so is that what you guys to take out any go project city uh it's it's kind of opened our eyes and generally I think he's still fighting for it ah I don't know if it's made its way in any for production code yeah that's uh it's

something that people are playing with all right well thank you very much for taking the time stomach thanks a lot thanks

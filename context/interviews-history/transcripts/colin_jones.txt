hi I'm Mike Hale with you tastic here again at SCA I'm sitting down with Colin Jones also known as tripped Jones guarantee common tiara peak excuse me triptykon it's one of those days uh but actually I kind of a funny story of how what is tripped mean again I'm used trumpet just obviously radiation for trumpet yes he's a trumpet ear but he's also a closure issed and he's the the

core maintainer of the closure Cowen's so can you tell me a little bit real quick often people who are not know what is the closure cones again right so the closure cones are a set of exercises that sort of walk you through the basics of the closure language they start from basically assuming no experience teaching you like you know how the syntax looks and what how different

functions like equals function application you know starting starting at the very base level and walking you up through knowing a little bit more about them but you have to be a master when you finish but you're immediately know you're going to have touched most of the major syntactical structures yes and you're going to sort of yeah and yet is for it to be very very stepwise and

to teach you the closure language okay and you know how did how did you have you always been into lists for how did you come to be involved with with Chloe other columns right so I think this may be like 2009 like mid-2009 or so I haven't seen a lot of people talking about Lisp and structure interpretations and computer programs that book from famous book for an MIT essp book right

people talking about Twitter about how great that wasn't stuff and I'd never done any list I didn't come from a background computers so I decided you know start learning some Lisp and done along the way I heard that closure who's this like Lisp it was actually supposed to be useful in real life not another lisps the practice but like that was like the core but as it comes jvr so it

has a exactly exactly analysis but you know the value proposition that I was presented with so I was really interested we watched the peep code that Phil Hinkle brooke put together and as a company and then we went through steward Holloway's book programming closure believe it's that one not whatever America well first one that came out

right now I'm so you know there's learning the language in that way and then Aaron bedre from relevance formerly foreign elements now groupon put out a call on Twitter that he was starting this project called functional Cohen's and he wanted people to add things for Scotland f sharp and closure and some like that I was like how that might be an interesting way for me to contribute

I've I've always been like interested in getting into open source software and contributing but at that point I closure knowledge was pretty small so I figured that you know see what they had going on and maybe I could sort of learn the language better by writing some of these small exercises right so those basically I was like ways I find out why shirt away in some big library it's that's

you're actually that's learn while we create yeah exactly exactly and i think that was still during my apprenticeship that they play it so it was sort of like very much in the mindset and i still have it to some extent but um very much in the mindset of okay I'm just going to learn like learn things about about this new language so yeah that's kind of approach at dick was just to to learn

about language by by writing elements with your cones and so I you know send Aaron a few pull requests and he was kind enough to merge them in and give me some you know let us step up there yessum so he out to you learn a little bit better while you were contributing building yeah absolutely and then eventually like he got busy and I was I was writing more than he was and he just

gave me the commit bit on the project and yeah things went from there yeah so yeah the site was relaunched and it's it's heavily I mean even a sites the closure callin sites is written in dude oh boy yeah yeah it's actually really closure we actually had this closure Cohen's column is the place you can go to learn more about this and also github page but close your coach com

will link you to the github page and yes I was actually done by by an apprentice mark grant I did most of the work on that mostly design and stuff and we had some more design apprentices come in and refine some good sign and once elements so yeah it's been been really great to see it's easy you go through an evolution and finally get launched publicly it's just a few weeks ago so is

it been something where i show you you were able to come in and contribute work with Aaron and keep learning from him has there been a lot of people coming to the closure console or enclosure that you've been able to communicate with yeah I think um I think that is the case I think I think we see a lot of people who may be people who have heard of the Ruby cones before which is kind of

inspiration for the closure comments but um people who are familiar with the idea of using these sort of exercises is a way to learn looking for something like a comment exercise i think by word of mouth i see on twitter a lot of people people go through them just you know with a group of people unfamiliar to language and people seem to just seemed to enjoy them so that's really nice if

you heard back from anybody who's gone from zero as you actually able to use the language through the colon yeah i know i haven't heard him i haven't had anybody like explicitly like email me and say okay you know i started the Cohens last year and now i'm writing production code yeah we certainly had a mess since we've done that at a flight but sold sure you're even using it

internally as a teaching tool yeah yeah generally when we had in pursuit we want to learn closure one of the first things we do maybe not the first thing depending on who they are but yeah we're usually will recommend that they just go through the cones I mean it takes probably you know anywhere from like a focused two or three hours to like you know spaced out

of the course of days or something it's not a huge undertaking to complete these we're always adding more to them so by the time you see this you may are you taking patches and contributors oh absolutely yeah yeah love love giving patches gotten a lot of really great contributions people writing whole new files and on the on the github site there's a there's an idea board for

things that we want to implement things we want to add as exercises but we just haven't gotten around to it yet if Aaron alluded to the fact that it's now more of a Cohen's engine now then like what does that mean that's right so Sam reishi from Twitter had he works on the castellan project catalog is like a sort of closure interface to cascading which closure interface and sort of logic

engine around cascading which is a Hadoop thing but it's this really awesome thing that they that they're working on and he wanted to use something like the Cohens to help people learn cast log so he extracted the bits of closure Cohen site that were dedicated making them work he extracted those from the the actual exercises themselves right this selves and so yeah

you put in a ton of great work on those so that those are those are ripped out so now people can you know right close your cones for not just closure the language for people to learn things you know corelogic or not match all kinds of closure libraries we haven't seen you know a ton of people using it I know catalogs use again those two libraries I mentioned but yeah we look see to see

something like see what you've worked on so you handed it yay how did she get over from Aaron worked on it and then somebody else saw it and said hey I can make it better and it contributed it contributed to the project and now it's just about yeah absolutely it's one of the great things about source software in general to seeing that kind of thing and just something

that's more context means earlier Corey Florida was talking about the progression of using some of these tools the concepts of a cod I it's basically an exercise that we just repeat over and over and over again versus Cowen's and now we're cones are very out of context you're just writing a data structure you know is that something that you might have seen because I've worked with

mentoring people where I gave him the Cohens first thinking that that was a great thing but they didn't have the contacts yeah and I think there's a lot of people who don't it becomes waiting not you know here's the syntax one language you have to be motivated in a very specific way I think and it's sort of the way I learned is to think about syntax and all the bits and stuff and I

I'm re already want to learn the language for something but there's less people who prefer to learn the language by talking to a guy yesterday it was writing a closure service now and he just really likes just jumping into a nap yeah I'm having you know having all the other context as you said there for him right he wants to know the reason he's he's writing these things and and

he's not really necessarily interested in in learning for the sake of learning the language itself but he wants to use it immediately to do things and I think that's really mean different learning styles that's really interesting happy but it is just one more tool in the toolbox that people can pull from sure well thank you very much for our connect cell phones and for speak what needs is

absolutely

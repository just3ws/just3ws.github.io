user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's Mike again with you tastic I'm so here today go to calm 2013 here in Chicago I'm sitting down with one the lead organizers crust and thora he is

one of the leads here and he hasn't kicked me out yet so we're doing pretty good I thank you for sitting down with any person ha thanks for having me I i interviewed david ghaderi when he was uh if i said that correctly um but anyway I interview David when he was first here scouting out Chicago and as a possible place for go to come well obviously a lot has happened between Dan and also

sitting here today you know can you tell me a little bit about maybe some of the back story about how the decision was to finally come here to Chicago how did you make that decision and then even more how did you get involved in running bow chica yeah I'd rather start with the last question okay because we so my company truck pork that organises these things have been doing conferences for

many years and we really started it as you know initially it was it was basically a way to do our own continues lifelong development learning experience and of course sharing that with our local community which made it possible so you imagine a little small company in a far away country that doesn't really can't really afford to send our employees doesn't fancy conference

abroad and actually back then there wasn't really that many good comfort it was in this kind of industry practitioners conference the weren't that many it was mostly either either very academic conferences or or these trade show we think which were very marketing I here's how you use our product so expensive so 15 years ago the word really no conferences

in this in this middle in this middle space and that's what really the conference we wanted to go to ourselves and then add to that didn't want to put all our employees on an airplane repository us some other place whether it was conference like this so we figured we better make our own comfort right um was that called kochu or was a different campus Wow the very first year

it was called Scandinavian Java technology conference or something obscure like that and then pretty quickly we transitioned into calling it JA who JK oh okay because this was most of what we did back then looks job on we were like a java java shop and so kind of focused around the object revolution really happened in in the mid 90s people really starting to topic turn into

programming big time and job of course was the big thing that they pushed this so so Jo Jo who was some to the name at that point but something was a few pronunciations even your eyebrow then you said yeah ciao yeah there's lots of you know we want to be open up in Australia we also get back then it was called also child yeah civilians couldn't figure out how to

pronounce it so so down there was then later renamed so yeah y ou W oh okay um this is really just a different spell yeah yeah and also more generic and about the same time we decided to go with the name go to as that's the more generic well it also has a nice play on go to Chicago go go to wherever wherever yeah and it and it makes me the go-to guy yeah oh you are gonna put you out or

whatever yeah so um so what I find really conferences is it's a great way to meet people you know organizing conferences it's fun it's a good way to meet people in a positive vibe right both the customers business partners because you meet in this and learning environment where where things are new and exciting I'm see you don't necessarily work on exactly you see

things you don't necessarily work on is it's a good way to broaden your scope and go and be on top of things right so so in many ways it's uh there's so many positive things about it do or it keeps and being the organizer of course we put a lot of effort into figuring out what is the what our new trends that are interesting times it provides an excellent way to meet new people and of

course it's a challenge to continue to to be to be on top stop correctly so that's the big challenge and driving conferences like this is to you know we always have to be like a couple years ahead of everybody else how to stay ahead of the pack in terms of what's what's news and what what's happening and of course you can't do that yourself right so so it's a matter of figuring

out how to how do you make other people help you figure out what good is the next big thing or what's what what's going well it sounds like there's a challenge because one of the things I noticed its unique is you invite speakers other conferences will do open calls for speakers and it's something money should be more burdensome to have to you invite because gentle figure out

okay you don't really do knowledge about who's who and what in what they know in different domains that's right I mean it's a net sense it's very much it is quite a lot a tough down conference many years of they have every once a year we have a meeting where where we bring together kind of an advisory board or program committee for for all our conferences

so we have like different people coming every year that typically will need to clean with it and send people over weekend and basically just brainstorm on new topics and the people we bring there are speakers that have been to our conferences for some years and then it kind of forms a pool of ideas or topics speakers that we can get draw from okay over the next year so you lean on a lot

of you go to conference and then should have built up a network and then you sure to tap that on network to find out hey what are you guys interested in let's exactly to rate a nice list of speakers and topics yes so so of course that's uh you have to kind of renew that you have to figure out a way to you know not always invite the same people to organize that without offending the ones

that don't get to go and at the same time keep some continually so that you know there's just kind of shared understanding of the level of the angles we want to push and wait and we tend to you know really like deep technical things things that have a historical route and value we often bring in like old guys that invented stuff many years ago like historical perspectives

practical applications but it's gases there's a lot of different things that kind of weigh in on that kind of decision nickel so but yeah it's a it's you know it's it's surprisingly challenging to just to keep pushing the envelope and to keep finding finding interesting stuff but of course it's a lot of fun to be in the middle of the right game like that also and also I

think it's funny when you mention that chain one of the other conference that satisfied what you wanted from a conference you don't have to ship people off overseas to be able to attend the conference now you have a company there bronze conferences and your shipping those people overseas to run the conference Hagel if it was a Zeppelin like it didn't his has just taken off in

a way she didn't expected I'm hell is that supple things about running conferences one is you know the really good speakers you know they have something interesting to say they typically go more than one place to say really we find some really good figure they would and they put a lot of effort into doing a nice presentation they would most likely want to go in

different places and give this in person station or similar presentation and you know so why not goes other presentations also happening on one of our comfort that kind of expensive down the other thing is the audience for a conference it is that's what we find tend to be fairly local a typical would see like between 60 please sixty percent on order of

sixty percent of course it varies but order of sixty percent local attendees right and as of course because it's much less expensive and more flexible to go to conference near to where you live well you go home and sleep at night if your employer something need so you can get back and get it back sound objection emergency it's not the same excuse me thing it's not travel hotel and all

kinds of things going on top so um so attendees tend to go to their local tumblr so so that was that then there's also it's kind of an economy of scale in in running more than one conference because it to turn it into a professional organization in need you need work to do around the year right if you only only run one event a year maybe that's that's not enough work for for

somebody to do all year all right at least not you know because when you actually run the conference you need I don't know five people to run a conference okay to organize it and like the carrot think we're in that order to people um but you can't keep five people busy boy that's right here to the comforts of you so it makes sense to have more

conference so you're going to have a professional team that does that what you have a core team that goes and once all the campuses of class yes okay and so so you have what a central office somewhere and they work from there and then they just travel around as conferences occur or how did how does that planning happen how did how did you well we have well they have a number of

offices and typically we have people working in different offices that are that are part of it too so we have these people in into our moose Denmark office okay London Amsterdam Zurich and in San Francisco letter K and a part of the conference team and in Poland also and they you know travel to they all they don't all go to all the conference I'll save it because there's so many going on

as you can see our Lester's yeah you're all just well we all over the globe we have on an order of 10 large conferences like this a year and then in many like one day events very snide well so if you collection heights yeah yeah there's lots of like techniques go to nice but there's also one day one day conferences at the topics and it's similar to attract at one of our conference all

eligible like one day conferences we in your blue no it's girl base this is a single day when I queries no single single track small conference smaller conferences and we also use the organization to run conferences for other companies like weird we've been doing we've been exhumed springsource conferences okay the meal meal for Jay Newton all of

these conferences so you work with some specific technology vendors to help run their conferences so you have and this is more of a question you know it's something statement you so you have go to comp but also try for status some basic conference organization yes it's a collective as a business ok so we also do that and then and then there's a number different brands which really

they different really reflect different partnerships that we were doing so we also part of the coupon conferences behind that we're doing with infocube partnership with them involved um tips offices of teleconferences right so there's a number of different things well the neck that really means that we can keep a professional organization running conferences

so you have things are going on all the time with conferences this is you know that a lot of times when we look at a conference with the konala just someone say your thing but really when there's a company like yours behind it it's coming it's running you're more like an offense company than just with it and yeah well conferences system is Alyssa part of our business right now and you know

what I think part of what makes our conferences unique i think is that is that we're really is out for a company and we you know the what drives us to the topics and to the content in general is what we would like to see as a software company oh come so my my day job is as the CTL when it's a first job okay me hundred have hundred people and there's there's maybe out of those three

hundred this 1015 doing conference organization okay that was one of us one since i was going to ask is when you first started saying oh I want to watch this conference just as my vision of what a cover should be did this eventually replace your previous business focus but it sounds like it hasn't no this is a venture that you're not this isn't replaced the original

that's not it so it's a great way being a software company continuously we knew our not knowledge and it made really mean so we can begin it's a software business we can continue to be a top of things and do the newest things we're just like we were early with Java and that was kind of predated the conference the number of times been you know been fortunate because of this to

be part of new things happen so we it's a constant source of inspiration and new business opportunities and new technologies that we can see and evaluate and and felt our customers right so it gives us a good footing some kind of high-profile technology software shop interesting so this is this is definitely those I don't quit your day job kind of things see you're doing this

is kind of on the side to help support and do some interesting stuff but you kept the core focus of the business and this is an adult to expose what your company is and then also satisfy some your own training yeah we actually don't quite careful not not promoting to try for the company at our conferences okay because you don't want to turn this into try fork world alright because that

would that would make it sound like devil devil world or whatever laughs like a marketing marketing like thing was just you know much more indirect aspect of the country the core focus once you add a conference of course is you know transferring interesting knowledge from the speakers to the 10 days and you know you know when you run a high quality conference

you also tend to often hear this from his figures that that that the kind of attendant attendees that are attracted to these conferences also tend to be high quality so they really enjoy their texting with attendees and the questions young you know the stories and issues and whatnot had been at its Indies have so this is good for four speakers as well as the 10 course I mean dumb a good

quality conference is one what the speakers want to go to see the size students Brian to interact with the people they're very conference so yeah it's always at anything other than bolts after this session or they say they talked with you now to get to know everybody yeah you often see there's that many other conferences that the speakers will tend to fly in just for

the talk and then they're off again or they'll go to the speaker's labs here at our conferences we explicitly don't have speakers lunch so we don't want this the speakers to kind of escape into certainly a little special area where it's whether it's like a VIP area right like that one we want it to be be visible and part of the part of the event and all that champagne and caviar

is really expensive ha all we do have is typically have like a speaker's dinner you know with what would typically invite you know also typically we have volunteers CS students or user group which is a pencil but not want to come help it's it's a it's always good to have some extra hands right at a conference like this for checking badges so helping

with running air into various things at the conference and one thing is people that are going to be watching this who you'll run your own smaller conferences or just interested in how things go and myself even included you know I remember when dave kane and he was just kind of scouting out chicago getting to know the community talking to lots of people I'm but I am curious is some of the decision

not not just for Chicago but what is what are some of the how do you decide on and evaluate a location and then make a final decision that yeah that's the place we want to try to be hosting a conference at or is that a trade secret there's no special secret in that and and and it's not it's not very scientific at all I mean typically it's a it we get requests to run our

conferences everywhere so typically it's it's a matter of like personal relationships typically we know people in that area we are would like the area we want to go there ourselves great ah there's all kinds of subjects it matters also but of course a strong user group group community one of the things that we do not we're not actually very good at marketing these things right and and

like regular marketing is very expensive so we tend to run the marketing by you know kind of lean barely means and and indirectly we are usergroups and running our go two nights and these kind of community like efforts so having something like strongest local user groups to to to help us bring up the message is really valuable so that's

definitely important when you've been selecting a location whether we think that there's somebody there that can help us bring out the message and get kind of get the message to the potential attendees so if I'm in the city and I'm looking at this video and I'm like oh I you know I think my city has has some unique value that would be great to host a I vote you come how how could somebody

robotics get in contact with with somebody from thing to go to come from talking to him figuring those things out well it's it we're typically easy to find you know we're all moved all over the world in our conferences right so if I mean everybody welcome to come in approaches okay um I mean there's nothing nothing special about that okay there's no specifically if you'd like to

host go check on this is the form and you have to have this listen ousness qualifications hmmm no but it's it really uh you know no I mean that Sam that's all very effective and you know comes from talking knowing people and I did and everybody's welcome to ask us then you're just our final question is having runs from my conferences what is there any advice you have for somebody

who's running your conference maybe in two to three hundred percent conference for things that they should think about our be aware of that maybe we're surprising when you first ran a conference that you've learned is there been any particular things that might stick on your mind is like this was something I didn't expect but over the years doing X Y or Z is is really

improve the quality of the conference or one particular thing yeah it's difficult down I think it's important to it's important to make it worthwhile for me and think of a think of the speaker's made and it's important to make it a fun thing to go to put the speakers suit I think I think that's if there's one thing one piece of

advice like is of course it's important and the conference is not run for the speaker right quite put but that because want to come there and enjoy being there do something for the speakers and think about that so I think that's important it's important because that's like the seed that's like that the core and it drives all the other good effects okay so if you take care of your speakers

you're usually going to be having a higher quality conference and bringing speakers back your four year exactly so it's like you want to be in the positive rumor mill of kind of the speak that the speakers tend to know each other right on across conferences so you want to have a good rumor going that's the conference yeah all right well thank you very much particular time to talk oh you

appreciate it and appreciate you let me do the interviews here too you're welcome thanks user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm you

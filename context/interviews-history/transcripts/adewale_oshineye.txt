user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at SEMA 2013 and i'm sitting down with a dios mio and he is one of the co-authors of the apprenticeship patterns book a

few years ago which is still a popular book in the sufferer craftsmanship community but it's also an avid documentary and he's one of the people that takes his observations and you're able to just as you said take them where the people are and you're very avid documenter almost almost to like a casual journalist I would say but you're a developer and as check Henderson can I

joke earlier what is the extra prayer developer do as they look at the other person's shoes but you kind of look a little bit higher and you're looking at things and I think it in a unique way so first you know thank you for taking the time to sit down with me and you know what what when I say when you kind of said you take aware that people are let's start with what does that mean and

how do you figure out where the people are so the way you find out where the people eyes you ask somebody it doesn't really matter who you ask they'll tell you something and it's a place to stop it may be wrong but it's morning you knew when you started for me it's about so in my job I'm a developer advocate i work with google's platforms I work with external companies external developers

to help them grow whatever product or thing they're making using our AP is part of that job means you have to find these people now some of that is putting yourself in a place where they can find you so I try to make sure that I'm on pretty much every social network or platform that exists so people can find me but that doesn't mean I have to be an active user of every single one so for

example I'm on app.net I don't use it that often but I'm there if somebody wants to ask me a question so it's trying to be available so trying to plug yourself into many places as possible well trying to be in places where you can be useful to people not necessarily of everywhere so for example I look at a lot of the big Chinese social networks but I realized

that I wouldn't be of any uses understand what anybody is saying right yeah it's I was I think it's qui gong Kegel the one of the uh I'm trying to think of that that the china-us are actually I'm thinking of the Chinese are a Twitter equivalent I've looked at that and like well maybe I should put you classic on there but I don't know how I can engage there so it's it's a very

interesting perspective is you kind of had to be selective so you want to be it sounds like you want to be in this many place as possible but not just any place you want to be in places where you add value where you are helpful I think you talked earlier about how I'm a document so there's a couple of patterns in apprenticeship after that I'm really fond of one is record what you learn the

other share what you learn them and the reason i like them is that often most of the things people think I share not really sharing them I'm just recording them just recording them in public and something that's useful for people so for example i'm interested in a thing called Zuko's triangle it's a tricky problem in identity and i reckon the bat in a few times over the years I've never

found one good source that link to all of the interesting articles by the subject and so I made a post in which I hash type it feature me and I put it there so now I can go to google and search sucrose triangle hashtag future me I'll find Matt and if I don't find it it means I didn't actually create it and now create it so it's doing these things to help me future versions of me find

information they need and then that tells our usual for other people but because you put it out in an open place it can be there but it's so it's it's that I'm helping myself but if it might be useful for you great exactly it's the same reason why I take so many screenshots and put them flickr initially it was because I wanted to learn I want to understand how people

design software why people do the things they do and by putting them on flickr making the public i found that when people ask me a question like hey how does this work i could say oh you want to know how you know NPR does signing you know how to do signing effectively if you are using Twitter to do sign but you need the user's email address oh I took a screenshot of flavors of some the

five staff and doing that a couple years ago I search a Google I find it a girl cool i send you the link right and you think oh thanks but I do do it for you yeah I did it for me because I want to understand it two years ago and now it's useful it's almost like taking your memory and being able to put pieces of it oh it's where it can be utilized yes I've taken the things I recorded the

lessons I recorded and I now make Panama format where I can share them and again that also brings us to an interesting point earlier in a post interview conversation I was talking with somebody who said that they became a speaker by accident and I said well but obviously you had something to share he didn't have to become a speaker you just had something to share and you know that the

speaker part was important it was just that you had something they came up that could be interesting for someone else but it's hard to determine what could be interesting for somebody else so just by putting things out there you let other people decide I think people decide about the things that I share do they find useful and the things I share they find irrelevant but I focus on recording

the things I was valuable to me so for example I had a day once where I went out and I basically took screenshots of the home pages of every popular social service I could find on the web and we had about 50 of those I told people oh by the way I've collected fifty of them heads of what the front page looks like and then people safe saying oh you missed this one

a little bit around cool thank you and now about 80 something of those and I'm enter this startup they call the back scratches and we were having a discussion about what the design of their front page should look like what did it say what is it trying to achieve and I was trying to explain and wave my hands and I remembered I had this album over 80 something front pages of sites

and I update this over time so you can see the evolution of these sites I said you know let's go through these and by going through when you go through 80 something the leaves you can start to see oh these people have focused on making easy people to sign up right these guys really want you to basically buy stuff and want to make it very clear that they sell things these people they

don't expect you to ever hit their front page to this we will be signed it and you could start to see these patterns but I hadn't created it to help the start about his mentoring you've sung it created in the beginning because I was curious and then other people helped me because it was helpful to them and now it was it becomes saying useful to all of us so it sounds like you you know you

have all these curios that you've accumulated in one of the risks here if you have lots of knickknacks around this is getting cluttered do you occasionally prune so I don't prove I guess I probably should but I don't what I do is I throw them all linked to fairly obscure places have a screenshot album liquor I have a tumblr called presentation bottle which contains

random photos I faked my visual presentations I have an album on plus of the front pages of sites I put them there next electronic so it doesn't feel like it's clutter because it doesn't get him away and I depend on web search to move to find them again and often things that I've accumulated and I think maybe I should prune this do I really need you know five photos showing the evolution

of look at home page and then flick it as a massive redesign and then suddenly understand in the context of the evolution of it then this is contingent in the evolution becomes really valuable I think that's one of the really powerful ideas i got from a guy called Bush he wrote a paper called as we may think just after the Second World War and he describes something called the

Memex this idea that if you could gather the information and then somehow plot the trails you take him through that information and when other people were trying to explore that same space they could see your footprints and by looking at the the part of the warning to that data set my oldest footprints they would understand what was popular what was a valuable it maybe even what was safe if

also that it if you're all of a sudden you just see a well-worn path that always ends at a certain point maybe there's a boomer or something so maybe you find that everybody who reads this article then reads this article and always quotes this article but never that one right you might realize maybe that outlook isn't that useful thing mmm typical coat yeah one of the things that

did ask this makes me think about is that trying to write I recently suffered this with blogging and even we're trying to jerry captain for you tastic is I think about hmm I gotta write an article it has to be really interesting but it doesn't sound like you're limited by that it you write and then you take a step back in what some may be some something or this is how long inferring

it you let some self simmer and then come back and say oh okay there is some something useful there but by the constant writing the constant generating content and then eventually take a step back and looking at bigger picture you can plug them together and see a piece of something that can be interesting that part of the problem that we have is that we feel that we have to do this big

thing up front we gotta let this big amazing article from but I think the way I it's not that deliberate I wish was that planned out it's more like record and something record in public something occurred in private so the recording paper sometimes they record digitally and every night again I share so for example I came in this morning and I was talking to somebody and they

were somehow they come from a non-traditional background and I wish there was some kind of road map on the things they don't know they don't know right and I said no I did a talk about this two weeks ago I promised those guys I was probably going to send him some notes and I haven't but here evan is my laptop and I said you know what I'll just push this online right right

because otherwise we have to email it to you into everybody else you went to this talk and I put it online i can send anybody a link and if they want to share other people they can and if it's of no use to anyone it's okay and I think that's what you just described is what I was trying to say is that the embrace the informality of our information and that the information be naked a little

bit that it doesn't have to be always dressed up in a perfectly intro point point point summary structure can sometimes we hear some information I mean it's okay to make mistakes it's okay to publish something and say oh this is wrong I actually wrote something of a while ago and I mentioned leads low and actually no I was talking about something around community for me and

then Thomas van der Waal told me oh you don't know if I read slow clearly and I like sharing with me and I went oh it's there good explanation of this and it's as well know that Wikipedia pages Amenas horribly confused but Harrison play just to start and I you've spent the last you have sort of been looking up and I feel like I need decent standing of it now and so I have this mental note I should

really write that up you know not necessary to help other people but initially just to clarify it for me so sometimes i right not because I want to communicate but because I want to understand it slide a I got from a nautical Wiggins in sir he has a book called right to understand it's the arguing this you write things down so you understand them better because now

you have to say well what does that mean and once you've written down you may actually then say okay now I understand this you can publish that as it as it is I've you may not understand you may need to look Lee and say you know what for other people to understand this I have to clarify so i'll try to explain reasonable to for example right so do you know that castle um I know

that name so he invented ethernet amongst other things but the general idea i'm going to mangle this is that the value of a network increases as a function of the number of connections between the nodes in that Network okay if you have the world's only phone it's utterly useless right okay because you can't phone anybody if you can if there's another person will you confirm

that person there's two other people there's two potential phone calls you can make there's two potential photos they can make those two potential phone calls this person can make now there's six different parts and that grows initially as a number increases the valley so the value of communication that you can reach the more clicks act like so it's I think it's N squared to

the size of the number that number of nodes in a network so we came up and said you know there's a interesting thing you can see in these netbooks imagine you could form groups of people with India networks so in a group of let's say five members I can form a group that's God's there are all these combinations of two people as a group those are groups there are all these

conditions are three people they only condition for good people and this what grows faster than x squared this goes at 2n so the point he makes is that if Meg have slowed to grows like this Reeves Law grows like this and the inside he comes from that is wait a minute that means if you're building a social network if you've done the communication system if you let your form groups the

utility the value of the thing grows much faster so it really causes a good for me network in a group forming network the value goes faster than a normal network so in theory if phones had started off and they'd worked out a way to let you phone model people phones would have increased in value much quicker then because they could only do one to 10 is it because I can by having

a connection to two groups I actually have for each member of that group I'm able communicate directly to them you can communicate multiple sets of people so the set of people you can communicate with if there's a network they say it has four members and I can only do point to point then I as a person can only have a path to each of those three

people s3 right but if I can have a path to all the subsets right as well as to each of the individuals that's a much larger number of connections which means there's a much richer set of things it means you can take a large community pull aside little sub groups and the subgroups can invent things that the whole group couldn't have done and if you have many of these subgroups you can

do lots of interest in things so Flicka is one of my favorite examples of this there are obscure Flickr group devoted to pretty much everything so I had my i'm using my fuji x100 camera nowadays it's quite old but i like it and as a community for that or then that means there's a committee for people who take black and white photos with the fuji x100 and then there's probably a

community for you who say black white photos with the fuji x100 in london and then that's probably wanted music photos like that in North London and then in the eastern part of the London and in all these subgroups and it's all these places where you can interact with the things you make and all these potential conversations you could have I think the idea of reeds is noise that there are in

a group forming Network there's more value and I think one of the mistakes we make is that we think of the internet that we say this is the internet it's got to you put something billion people in there are two point something billion connections I could have but then you look at all the subgroups all of us each site is its own little sub week and that's why the internet is growing value

so quickly compared to something like the phone or television because you go we do one-to-one or 12 minute you couldn't reach subgroups this is why things like what kind of instant messaging stuff we're seeing I've growing value so quickly compared to television and this is a really bold insight and the implications of it I don't

well I don't even understand the kitchens you had that it's very interesting even at a microscopic level I'm thinking about even small tools that recently I the team on my mom me switch from campfire to to hipchat we have good okay well that's a group their balls group chatting it's fine okay people can join groups but in one I can spin up a very simple small subset of chats a team

is working on a specific thing but I don't have to go off and into ass up a tool to do it i just i'm right in there or i don't have to go up and it's less complicated so in hit chat and just suck his people and i'm in a subgroup and but i can still have the main group they're accessible and but it came for are going to kind of go and it was a lil bit more cumbersome and you know he had to suffer

a different room it was Jennifer why once I sure to everybody they just immediately switched over every the whole company within one hour which everybody was over on I'm the new system and completely just left it over one behind then it was the first sense how people using was sub chats sub chats not having to spend a buzz separate Ruben and having a developer channel just hope

some of the three developers where I had our own little group so we could talk without being noisy and in the main group or rework the thing is you already wanted to have these conversations of the past but you didn't because they'd be noise to the whole community right in the same way that you can come to SEMA and there are people here who are willing to rails and their people here

really into closure if all of us has always been that one conversation then many of the interesting slide conversations can't happen so there's people for example hair who really need to know microservices and I've been spent a lot of time defining those people and you're interested in that topic and in a network in a conference in the event that makes it easier to

find these subsets these birds of a feather it's much more valuable than if there's this one ization it's one of the reasons why I like a multitrack conference of a single track conference single track conferences are much more focus and it's easier to manage but you have less variety you have few way you have fewer interactions the network is less rich

either as I really couldn't coffee this morning I did it was a real sunny haha well I came in early to get set up and I got to witness what I think is a description of what you're describing an action where we're inside of a larger group but in the coding comfy what they did was each table was separated so when I came in I didn't realize what was going on I just saw clusters of people

sitting around different tables and I assumed that when I first walked in I just assumed it was just people that happened to group but then as I walked around I saw oh no there's a c++ table there was an airline table and then there's different numbers of people at different groups but they self-selected inform their groups and then something went up onto the stage and was able to

address all the group so it was we're in this big subgroup but then inside of that group there's subgroups and they're all talking and communicating to each other but when you came and sucked out you could talk to all the groups I'm not sure exactly how that maps into it but it's something now that I'm thinking about when you're talking about heaven groups of people and then they can have

their own private shatter that's no distance Verlaine interesting is only going to be interesting to people in Berlin but if somebody stands up and they broadcast they can hit all of those groups and that each group can then decide whether they want exactly see this is what we said earlier we talking about go whether people up let's go with the right people so if you are

interesting talking about a line you should go where the airline people are if you go up to something that's larger so you might go to Java one for example huge conference there are probably other people there they'll be really hard to find yes go to an airline conference and it would definitely be electable there I'm looking very easy to find yes now and this is I think one of the thick

lessons from Reed's law that you can create these little subgroups where you can do small things and some things what's crucial fail that's okay because it doesn't affect the health of the overall thing and that's why I think there's a lot of TV lots of really small interesting communities insights and which that's why you so many different

sites yeah yeah and in it exactly if there had been one table where they put out a banner for a language and nobody wants that ah the other groups would still exist the conference would still go on but that one table just thought I mean what I think I would have done differently I would probably would also giving people little pieces of paper when it could put up they could have

written down the names of groups that I the organizer wasn't the world so goodness knows how many of the people who are there we're really really interested in elixir for example right I would love to have talked about that i mean i know dave thomas is interested in that but and then they think the organizer could have come and said are let's put the ER line people next to the

Ruby people yeah you know and then that's a way to connect those two brew exactly so I'm one of the concept I'm really actually interested is the constant very awfully so say heads off for like hatred for me yes so everybody okay a large number of people know about the cost of him awfully but birds of a feather flock together phenomena okay which is what we saw this morning with

all the roomie people on one table or like people one table job one table that's nice but the reason I'm interested in a truffle you truthfully is says that what happens if people who want similar flock together how do you create that kind in Riley how do you have ideas flowing between different groups so not the same but similar but different ok so how awfully is people

who are similar quantum clustering together at roughly two people who are different clustering together okay the idea is that if you live in her MA Phyllis network where everybody know you know is a ruby programming the number of new ideas you run into its gonna be fairly low because you all with the same things you all do the same things you've relatively simple tools however if

there's one person in your little committee whose so an Al and programmer then they bring in ideas from the Olin commuted Ruby community and from really commit to the other line community and if this person is here in a home office network because they're clustered together with Ruby people and along people the and if you have a few of those kinds of people in

your network you have new ideas coming from radically different places and this also makes me think about an interview from a cna as well from last year i did with Patrick watch about network leaving is this a similar exactly it's this idea that you have our awfulest network that has her trophyless networks working through it and if you do that if you create this you go to the trouble of

doing it you can be mostly much more valuable so you can say I'm buying a ruby conference but I'm not bringing some of these of UX designer to share some of their insight so I'm going to bring in somebody who is a concert pianist and bring them in to share some of their insights and it's different it's tough you wouldn't have come up with because you don't belong in that

community that world and they're bringing their new ideas and it changes you Jesus your community in ways you wouldn't have organically it changed it's interesting so like as a user group organizer might think about if you if you focus on Java bring in a rubios if you let focus on or the Ruby medicine they do something very interesting where they actually bring in people who aren't

even developers um you want to build bridges to other communities the way that's how new ideas new possibilities it happen well thank you very much particular terms done with me a lot to think about thank you very much user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of

information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm you

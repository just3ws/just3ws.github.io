you hi it's mike with you tastic I'm rails complicated 14 and I'm setting or three Hightower ah who runs the Windy City rails in the Chicago ruby conference will also brand-new conferences which just announced today would be curry well great first thanks for taking the time to speak with me thank you for having me you won my first our enemies hope you're

not was a guinea pig yeah you on my last every one of those yeah but I you know you and thank you for taking the time what is thank you what is Ruby cream Wow Ruby Karim is a brand new conference we just announced it today it will take place in January okay when you tell somebody ruby conference in january the same won't it be cold and then I tell them Ruby caritas in the Caribbean focus

in Barbados barbados are Barbados yes January and precisely Chicago man it's beautiful it's beautiful there and the ideal audience the people that were that were attracting our intermediate to advanced Ruby developers who want to get better they want to ramp up their skills and the format will be one not a typical conference we have presentation after presentation I think that's good that's

what we do with windy city rails but with Ruby qareeb you'll have a 30 to 45-minute presentation all of my and to our lamb directly tied to that presentation okay so it's almost like the hesitations little bit Aquino yes and then you have a few hours of focusing on the DL deep dive you know so very much hands-on deep dive it's for the developer who is well beyond

beginner you know intermediate to advanced and they want to ramp up their skills and so we've already lined up lab advisors so the people who were there in the labs will not only have the opportunity to interact directly with a presenter also with our lab advisors there and it's going to be exciting in how many is a somewhat of a perfect opportunity yes yeah of days January 27

through 31st in Barbados and only 100 tickets will be in Ellison yes question is right it's our kind of oddness focused audience yes very Jimmy not going to just trying to have as money as soon as possible no no not at all in fact we expect that we'll have a good number of people who are writing software in the Caribbean right now yeah you know like remote so so so something

already live yes there's some robbery live there right now and you know for some of them might imagine that they kind of want to keep secret such a good thing living in the Caribbean yeah I encode all over the world that some of them will want to keep it secret I and in addition we are going to award to full conference scholarships to students to to students who are studying in

Barbados right now oh really yeah you're gonna bring them out to the car yes thank you help them get exposure to you yes people from all over yes that's what they'll get and the students we expect to a trap are people who are already doing movie right now and will know that because one of the requirements for the scholarship evaluation will be they'll have to show us a project that they've

completed in Ruby okay so it's not just that they make an application fee is actually have shown that they have some rubies yes yes they have to show you looking to go to an excellent yes they want to do that you know and you think about student especially students today some of them you know they go to school they do whatever it is this studying there but a lot of students right now

are doing some remarkable things while they're in school you think about the creative ruby on rails right now what he was doing when he was in school there's students like that all over the world and we wanna we want to find two of them who are on yes yes she helped expose them and then expose you know I let them expose what they're doing to us as well yeah you know we can learn from a lot

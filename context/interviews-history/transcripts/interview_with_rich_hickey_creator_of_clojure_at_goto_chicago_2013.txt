user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations athira of information find out for yourself today that your classic calm hi it's Mike again with you tastic I'm here again at the go-to conference in Chicago 2013 I'm sitting down with rich Hickey rich as you may know is the

creator of the closure programming language I said it's a lisp dialect on the JVM thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me a it's a very busy conference but I appreciate it you're welcome um so you created closure and it was it was a you released it to the list mailing list and yada yada yada eventually there's user groups exploding conferences being formed about people

who were rabid fans of the language and the concepts and the ideas behind underpinning the language and somebody who's created this tool and then basically kind of released it to the world what is it like or what is your experience been creating this tool and then seeing these various groups pop up when you didn't have a marketing team you didn't have some evangelists out

there seeding money for user groups to pop up what what does that been like for you well it's you know it's quite surprising yeah I think when I wrote closure I definitely did it as a personal satisfaction project and you know being a new language analyst I did not expect very many people to be interested at all but I think Paul

Graham's book and essays and and the success of Python and Ruby sort of seeded people in their desire for new languages and for a list that they could you know actually use for day-to-day work so yeah it was quite surprising you know a message to two dozen people yeah and it got you know put on Hacker News and 20,000 hits the first thing it was

really something was some interest in the idea of it was already there before closure was well in one of the things I find interesting is that it's built on a pretty stable like the culture underneath job on the JVM people around that that's a pretty well-established community it's not not too much exciting things going on if people aren't rabidly well not so many rabid I'm a Java

developer I think people identify is Java but they're not as enthusiastic about it is they would say I'm a well versed closer to them or you know ruby developer so yeah I just think it's interesting that this the hottest language right now is built on this really incredibly vanilla but boring a platform it is that Spence something that that it's been you know a

boon or a bust with working with getting support for people on the JVM I think it's quite critical to closure success that it's built on top of something that it's an industry standard and people are comfortable deploying in production that's one of the reasons why closure was it was possible for closer to succeed was the fact that it was possible for people to use in production

and use where that work and and I think that's what helped drive people's enthusiasm was that they they knew they had to work with the JVM and now here was something that let them do something new and yet remain connected to what they had been doing as opposed to sort of drop everything and try something to okay kind of having that boring base allows you to have a little bit of

excitement and you know that that the underpinnings are nice and solid and they're not gonna yeah well they're they're not they're not just boring they're also quite capable and and robust and well tested and and and there's a lot of leverage in the libraries that exist there so you know I wouldn't want to belittle Java and the gbm's role more closure wasn't

necessarily a negative thing units it's it's that the born I know I can get up it's gonna be working right and I don't have to worry about yes not exciting and yeah you know you don't want to be excited way and but looking at another language and group the review where you don't always know things are gonna work you know those the libraries are always under a lot of churn you know that's not

necessarily the most stable community but what I see what the closure community is that much like the Ruby community that just grew up in ping this rabbit very much very passionate very vocal community I see a kind of mirroring in in the closure community where it seems like while closure is built on Java and it's it's a very well strong foundation the community that

came up in the Java doesn't seem to see the the community that seems to be migrated most to closure actually seems me more than Ruby community at least from my observations so the the numbers actually say that most I would say you know poor our plurality if the closure program just come from Java but there are certainly people coming from everywhere

you know from Ruby and from Python and from Scala and and but yeah it's a lot it's a lot of people who are using Java I mean a lot of Java programmers are interested in other things right and now this is this lets them pursue that so we yeah we definitely get a lot of job Java programmers have you have you gone ship to spit in and they use scripts I've ever heard like trying to go not as

rich Hickey but just see how people are using or how they're talking about closure I mean I've gone to the gone to groups I have always given a talk so I don't think I've just been an attendee too often sometimes at the New York I will just be an attendee yeah I mean it's it's so exciting to see what people are doing and and how big these groups are now it's quite it's quite a lot

going on you know we have now three conferences a year Coast and West Coast and Europe and the mailing list is gigantic 7,000 plus people or IRC is full of helpful people and very very active and that I think the community has been great there are people who are looking to help other people succeed and that's just been itself right what an even very

interesting projects and they're the reason I'm probably high probably in a ruby bias and I probably the reason I probably see more people from the Ruby community going to cloture is because of just my local you know what I see and I mostly interacted with Ruby in it I was just inferring though that more it seemed like a lot of the developers I know who've been doing Ruby are kind of

bored with for me or they started see cracks in rubies methodologies and how its implemented in there are certain similar limitations and they're looking at closure as being an answer to that it's is there any is there any truth in that I've been I've heard that you're you're a vocal critic of Ruby the language okay then that's that's no I couldn't be because I really

don't have very much experience with Ruby at all I do see people migrating from Ruby and you know they have their own stories about why they've done that but I would let them speak for themselves about that okay and in with with looking at the way the groups are forming is they're starting to be any I'm in the can rush II I don't like to ask is how

do you receive feedback from the community but do you have kind of like job Glennis model the Latin the Lennox model where it's you're the benevolent dictator and you decide how new features I brought in or do you solicit feedback from the users how do you go about working with the people who are out there using it and espousing closure yeah so it is a benevolent dictator

model but there are they're on the mailing lists and there's a big list which is sort of everybody and then there's a developers list which is somewhat smaller and more focused on moving forward and implementing patches and things like that so it's a more active group and that's the primary feedback mechanism and then there's a there's a JIRA and people can issue bug

reports and enhancement requests and we tend that so that's the best the process there now I am curious it's in the the conference's when you when you're when you're do you do you go through the Apple model of trying to hold back big releases until right before conference or or is it just new buddies this come out on a they come out on a regular cycle I mean

if we're if we're close to one before coppers we try to get it done I mean yeah we rarely have it done and then wait but we will often try to get something out beforehand so that people will have it to talk about it but it's not coordinated with them specifically okay and with with dealing between what what has been surprisingly I mean when you launch I'm sure I don't think you

expected there to be conferences and user groups popping up to the language but what is it you know aside from that what has been the most surprising aspect of the way people have started adopting in espousing I think it's just the the size of it has been surprising it's got everything against it right it's a list but it's functional and being on the platform it's on its dynamic which is

sort of not in keeping with the other entrance there and so just the quantity of people that are interested is really been astounding I mean the groups are huge now and they're all over the world and so yeah I think that's been the biggest surprise I think I was super concerned about the tone of the community from the very beginning that would be positive because you know there

had been other Lisp communities that had struggled with that and I think that had been a barrier to adoption and I wanted to make sure that closure had a clean slate there and the thing that's been really satisfying has been to see the entire community propel that forward because that after a certain point has one person you can't you manage that it has

to be sort of in the fabric of the community and I think a positive attitude is is in the fabric of the community and that just you know it helps to reinforce itself it has it has a in the Missis more of a question of becoming the center of this kind of list revolution for lack of a better choice is that is that impacted you like I know or I would see certain individuals that

when they go to a conference they may have gone from being just that person in the audience to now there are a center of attention and they're having to deal with that and I just wonder if that's something that's impacted your ability to move and in type of technical circles without being like a star for that people like hold there's your chicky and then they kind of pounce on you is that

been something that you've had to deal with or it's been something that's that has either been a positive or a negative thing that you could well I mean there's no there's no denying that what happened with closures changed you know my life was you know I wasn't a public figure before closure and and now yeah there's all this all this attention to closure and the ability to you know speak at

conferences and things like that you know I've tried to use that as an opportunity to talk about the ideas behind closure and you know not really to sell it but to talk about what it's about because I think those things were important to me in in making it but no it's it's mostly opportunity that's certainly you know I don't feel like people are passing or anything else I

mean I really enjoy meeting people and being part of the the conferences is let me meet a lot of great people and a lot of great speakers and learn a ton from other people so that's it's just been great do you see do you see the the closure like I'm saying the les Burke revolution do you think that closure has a long way to evolve and it's going to be working for with the

community or is it something that's kind of reaching a stable point and more we're going to be just minor changes we're where do you see so it's interesting it's funny because as you kept saying list by I wanted to respond by saying you know I don't think closure is sort of a battle list revolution at more than it is about a way of thinking about making software

simpler than it has been I mean that's really what it's about on the flip side being a list it should be small and most of the growth should come from libraries and so that's what that's what the emphasis has been and will continue to be you know it's not like it doesn't serve anyone for me to pile on features and closure and experiment with all kinds of stuff closures at the bottom of

a lot of people's work at this point and so stability and and and Anna cautious incremental rate of change is the most important thing because you don't want upset everyone who's made a decision and taking a risk to choose to use it on the flip side you don't need to keep fiddling with the list because in this it is a small thing and and and it is grow about via libraries and so that's

where the community has sort of just taken off closures growing most in the library space which is the which is how it should be not the core should be a stable kernel yes and then everybody bolts run it and then when I was seeing Westbrook solution I really should have been talking more about functional because it from where I just observed as I watch people who are adopting lists I

was shooting me adopting closure more on their workflow around me I also see you emacs and i also see them dabbling more with schema or or some other I'm drawing a blank here but other more esoteric languages or different structures and trying to stay one of the the the logic languages that I'm just drawing a blank on but but it's changing there it seems to me that people who have adopted

closure either the way they adopt closure helps them experience things in a new way or they're already prone to experimenting and closure to help them make a leap from a whole style I do think it's more in the people than the closure changing people I think that it's attracted people that are interested in ideas and that want to you know move forward and want to

investigate functional programming what to have better tools for managing concurrency and and and want to use it in their day job but I think you know I've never actively marketed it you know with with resources or not right I've never sold closure I just talked about what it is and and let the people with whom those ideas resonated show up and that's what's been

great because you know you didn't twist anybody's arm to use it you have to keep convincing them it's like these people have chosen to be here I think that's why they're so enthusiastic because it's a self-selecting yeah and and and I am most impressed by the community being a community that values ideas and you see it in the conferences it's not a lot of you know like how do you do X or how do

you do wire here's a new thing you know and here's the details of a thing and there are a lot of talks about ideas and a lot of a lot of investigation for instance of logic languages and CoreLogic is an important part of closure and and yeah so that's been that's really great I think it does attract people who are I'm interested yeah so it's it's not

it's it's a useful gateway drug a little bits of giving people a chance to break away from preset notions of how to write programs exposing them to new ideas and then saying okay well I've already seen that I can do something useful that's different than what I'm used to doing now let's go check out some more something and it kind of breaks that ice but you know like I was saying that I

know VIN users who are now completely dedicated using Emacs because they started to do closure and then they became comfortable with the parentheses so then they start to dig into Emacs Lisp so decided to just change all their their workflows there and it's been kind of interesting watching these individuals since they they make their migrations yeah I think we are you know

I think we're are in in their second phase of the kinds of users that we have in that certainly the early couple of years were people who fundamentally were interested in some core aspect than that either functional programming or Lisp and now we are seeing people who just see someone that they respect being enthusiastic about it and for whom the entire thing is new right both the

parentheses the list the functional macros like the whole thing is new and Nate they're really taking on something that's novel and a lot of new ideas and managing that second phase growth is something that the entire community needs to do because now the educational burden of closure is is much bigger right when somebody's got sort of none of the you know they frequently say of

closure maybe it's got four components to it and most of the people who came to it knew two or maybe even three of those right and now we're getting people who have one or maybe zero and so they need the community to help them get up to speed on serval almost all of the aspects of closure I mean people using closure we've never used the JVM or Alice or a functional

programming language or you met right you know so that's like a lot of novelty it's a lot of what you just said was it might it's coming I haven't done that background that it's been hard not for me to get on to Vanneman Ruby and all that and then I'm watching the people that I work with already moved on to closure and then they're got a whole new

tool chain that I don't know you know for the ground up and that's maybe you know I'd like to kind of X you a closing closing question this for people who are just completely new there's just so many resources out there some of them are getting a little long in the tooth you know some blog posts are outdated something but this er what would you recommend for somebody's just saying I

won't run closure you know what what what would you recommend a certain workflow or a tool which IDE what what would you recommend for somebody getting started they were saying I'm gonna I'm gonna do this uh-huh again it depends a lot on what their background is I certainly would say to investigate some of the books there are a bunch of great books out now

a lot of the early books are in their second editions and have had revisions so most of the books are current and you know if you can get an opportunity to browse through them at a conference or in a bookstore stuff like that and get a feel for it I would pick sort two that are in different spaces and you can you know talk on the mailing list or an IRC for recommendations that's a great way

to start and then absolutely you know getting in touch with the community early is super important you get on the mailing list hop on the IRC and you can slow people know you're starting out and you know but everybody will have a different set of needs you know their editor experience might be different their background might be different and what they're looking to accomplish might

be different which would also sort of shape the answer so I don't think this is sort of a universal answer to to getting started engage the community yeah just try to reach out you know people will have plenty of advice sure for that and that's what I said I do think that this next phase of growth is on the community even when I started with closure I mean

I didn't have time for instance to explain a lot of Lisp aspects right so a lot of the early adopters either had to know that or sort of get that on their own because I I just was trying to tell the story of how closure was unique and couldn't tell the story of Lisp and sort of the fundamentals of some of it and and now you know the scope for somebody who knows nothing is bigger still so

that's where the community comes in and they're already there there there's a bunch of support of tools and alternative documentation sites and and you know examples and yeah all kinds of exercises and things like that right so there's a lot of different things then you pick what you know makes sense to you and but I'm quite proud of the community and how well they are

receiving the newcomers and being positive and helping them you know succeed great well thank you very much you're gonna tend to sit down user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations athira of information find out for yourself today that you cast calm you

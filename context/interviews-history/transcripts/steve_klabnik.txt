hi I'm Mike I'm here with a Steve clad Nick at Windy City rails Steve does well if you do Ruby you've probably touched something that he's touched but he's also working with the hungry Academy to kind of bring people well up to speed with programming in a very short period of time make them employable can you talk a little bit about what you do with hungry Academy exactly totally so hungry

Academy is a partnership between jumpstart lab where I work with Jeff Kazmir and some other folks and livingsocial yeah and livingsocial so livingsocial knows how hard it is to hire developers and so they decided to take 24 people who had never programmed before of a program very little and essentially we've a jumpstart built them a curriculum and we went through 40-hour

weeks of class in like 30 hours a week of homework to train them into developers and over the course of five months they learned everything they need to know about building rails apps and the end of it they all went through the livingsocial hiring process and all ended up actually being hired which was something that they didn't actually expect to do they figure they would take

16 or 20 of them but they ended up actually taking all 24 so how did you find these 24 people I mean were they not developers at all people that transition so there was a mixture so what what livingsocial did was they put out this website and said we're going to do this hungry academy thing if you've ever wanted to learn how to program like and you want to work at it like let's do

this and they actually asked people to send in videos of them talking about why they thought it would be fun to learn to program and why they might want to be a programmer I sorta so he had to do a little video yeah kind of like this passion totally and so then you know a team at livingsocial went through all of those videos and figured out what who they thought would fit in well they sort

of went for cultural fit over everything else so if it was someone they felt like they would like to work with then they you know put those people at least that's my understanding I wasn't involved directly with that process but you know so most of the people had not done any programming before some of them had only done a little bit so like I know someone for example who she had

done a little bit of rails before but said they went through everything she knew on the first day also she had heard about it because she had been dabbling with programming and that's not like the channel share it through Bose not Merrilee a programmer before doing longer academy stuff okay so that was sort of the typical i would say hungry Kadim ii student with somebody who

either knew someone who was a programmer or who had heard about it because it you know received tons of tweets and retweets from everyone neither trying to get the word out like we want new people to be developers so that just curious too is issue were teaching these people about the programming we also i mean the the culture at livingsocial from the people I've spoken to is very important

and you're obviously also will engage community were you exposing people hate you know there's there's technical aspect but there's this other human aspect that totally so um I actually was not involved in the day-to-day teaching of hungry Academy Jeff living in DC and being in there at their offices Jeff and Matt Yoho did the actual day-to-day stuff but I visited a couple different

times and that was part of how they ran the project or the class was bringing in ruby developer small side stuff so they had one of the r-spec corps members drawn by you know like a ton of different people work for a living social and tons of different people in the DC area so anytime a well-known rubios was around they would bring them in and be like hey this guy wrote

something soft for you right let's talk them I think I pretty sure that like Aaron Patterson stopped by one time and gave them a you know talk about some stuff I know at least one of the r-spec people did and like you know the various other both employees and not employees of living social so that was sort of one way of doing the cultural stuff also in general when Jeff and I teach a

jumpstart part of our standard curriculum is an introduction to Ruby culture so we teach infra rails we actually start with a history of rails and a history of Ruby and talk about like you know Ruby came from Japan you know rails is invented because this company had a need to build better you know software to manage their freelance business and like all that kind of stuff

but it was I soldier yeah yeah so we emphasis his ring culture naturally and chunky boom yeah chunky bacon and a little teeny bit about why but um you know so that's like the first 15 or 20 minutes that new students that we teach always get exposed to because the cultural aspect is one of the best parts about Ruby and it's one of the most powerful resources that

we have so it's really important that we let people who are learning the language know about the culture they're about to join yeah that they're not taking something that was creating some corporate lap some place that was incubated just specifically to fit this one target demographic you know he was brilliant and wanted to create something new and interesting and kind of was a

little fun at first but then resins they've caught on I don't know like one or two people do it I it's kind of big now but um but it with the culture though and Ruby being itself actually kind of disruptive now you know the the growth of Ruby and starting to see it in places that aren't necessarily just startups and really bleeding edge total companies you know I relate that back to

to user groups and how they're I think a little bit disruptive in that they can change the way you approach having your your your social network that you don't just have it at the corporate office you have it with people that shared similar passions sir and and you you you tweeting right heavily about things like Occupy have you seen anything like you know with Ruby having been disruptive

towards programming like user groups and technical communities or self-organizing has that do you see any kind of relationship with like what's kind of going on now with political movements like Occupy I mean ultimately a user groups are definitely like a grassroot phenomenon right like your town does not have a user group unless someone cared enough to step up and start I use a

group and it's very similar to the way the Occupy organizes with working groups so you know each Bridget Rowland Kampmann twould spin-off different groups so like this is the food group and handle the food stuff this is the library group and they're handling all our donated books this is the you know Media Group and they handle our Twitter and Facebook account anyone that's

interested in doing those things can sort of self-organized and work in those areas the same sort of thing with user groups they usually follow a similar deal right like oh we need to find a place to hold our user group this month so i'm going to do that because i care about the future of the group and it's not because anybody told you to do it is because you want to do it and put the

group together so there's definitely some degree of communication in the sense of similarity with a grassroots pneus you know of user groups and the way that that sort of stuff is organized for sure we're definitely at a like a crisis in the Ruby community I mean unlike a literary sense where it's a tipping point one way or the other so we came

from a sort of super league a disruptive background right and we all hated Java and we're going against Java but the problem is is that now startups are getting more heavily client-side and so we're actually starting to lose the startup shininess that made us popular but our hatred of the enterprise is holding back our adoption in the enterprise too so we sort of need to

choose like embracing this new JavaScript heavy future which Ruby still has a major part of and you who does talk and a little bit is going to be about that when you see rails if you're watching this later you should check it out or his talk at railsconf and it's about this kind of thing where the role that Ruby plays in a heavy javascript world and how we can make that happen

and that's the path that needs to happen if we want rails to keep being in the startup world if we want to embrace the enterprise which is something that's been really successful to JRuby is actually a fantastic way for enterprises that have a lot of JVM deployments to use Ruby but not have to tell their ops people do stuff differently so like one of our clients got acquired by IBM

recently and their big app was AJ ruby on rails app because their prime technology was in Java they didn't want to have to teach all their ops people something new so they look to jruby to be able to take advantage of rails as quick development time but still leveraging their existing technology so that I think that those two paths we don't necessarily have to choose one of

the other but we should do one or the other of those things and so if we don't embrace heavy JavaScript apps and we don't embrace jruby and the enterprise and maybe distastefully you know do some XML every once in a while we sort of abandoned both either or both of those futures and you know I'm sort of scared that rails will not pick one or the other or both but choosing nothing is

not a path forward so that's that's one of the things that I'm concerned about is the future of Ruby and rails it's vicarage side you're going to be on and embrace that right other year same we're going to go and support the you know the integrations with corporate software and wherever that will take us or we're going to keep doing what we're doing and we're going to go off and do something

else but it's a clear decision yeah it's doing doing what we've been doing is now I'm going to continue moving forward right like anything that static will eventually fall apart especially in fast-paced startup world so we're pretty sure this yeah and so we need to make sure that rails is adopting to the way that the startup world is moving in order to continue to be the darling of

the startup world so and I you know one of the themes in your talk was was don't be you're all not another don't be evil but you know that people look at companies and assign evil not evil kind of labels you know the Google's not evil boria's yeah what is been but a but but the point is they send these labels and looking at like user groups in one of things is it can be expensive in order

to run a group and there's an ongoing cost do you have any thoughts on like approaching running a group or our conference that were you normally like kind of dependent on on some kind of corporate sponsorship sure you know so we were in Steel City ruby recently and we had a couple corporate sponsors for that but the the big thing is like not letting the money come with too many

strings attached so like if someone wanted to give me you know hundred thousand dollars in my conference but they wanted their logo on everything and they wanted to pick the speakers for example that's a totally different beast then like we want a table at the sitting off you know in the corner and you know we'll give you a little bit of money so I think that is important that we think

about the with the implied strings that the money gives us and make sure that it doesn't end up being too big of a costs like naturally we have to pay for things and so the money has to come from somewhere but I think that it's possible to do so in a way that's relatively inexpensive so like a steel city ruby we charge 50 bucks for our tickets and we only had like 10 or 15 sponsors and we

still made it all work anyway and our sponsors were awesome and we wouldn't be able to do it without them we would have been in the red right but it was not like we had to charge you know $1,500 like railsconf used to be a couple years ago in order to have a reasonable conference everybody really liked it we had it a beautiful venue and had lots of great speakers and like all that stuff

so I think that it's just important that you are conscious I think the underlying theme of most of the stuff that I talk about it do that it's important that you are conscious of the choices you're making and you don't make them for arbitrary reasons and so I think that people assume that we need to have a conference where you spend a lot of money and you

have these big sponsors and you have these elaborate parties and you have these elaborate venues and maybe that's not always the best thing if that's what you want to do you know do it like Nordic Ruby for example i love Nordic Ruby it was amazing but it was really expensive right and but there are other conferences that are not expensive that are also amazing in a different way so

it's just important that that choice is made deliberately as opposed to just assuming that this is how you have to run a conference okay or a usergroup yeah one and and this is not a gotcha question but after watching your talk here you're obviously well read do you have any any recommendations for people who are interested in in organizing we're interested in working inside of

communities something that maybe wouldn't be like there's not much reading material from a technical like running a technical user group or or leading a community do you have it it's or anything like you think of maybe their baby so one of the problems with with reading about this stuff and especially like if you want to apply the lessons that like occupy had to user

groups for example one of the issues is that all of that stuff is very much an oral tradition so you learn about these things because you interact people who had done previous organizing and you hear about their stories and you learn that way right so I'm actually not a hundred percent sure of a good thing to read because so much of it is lessons that I have learned from actually

talking with people and their previous histories so go some stuff that is written down yeah and you can sort of look up a lot of those histories but if you look into where all this stuff came from if you look into occupy came from the New York General Assembly and a lot of the initial members of it were involved in anti-globalization movement in the late 90s so looking up all of

that stuff like things related to that stuff is the way that you would learn about those things without doing so but I can't point in a specific book that is good about this stuff because I learned it by doing it yeah and it's it's you go and you see how it's done and you pay attention yes question yeah yeah that's that's actually one big critiques of occupies they didn't learn enough from

previous social movements and ended up reinventing those lessons because they weren't there at the time so like nothing is ever perfect or beyond critique but you know it's important that we continue trying to strive to be better and we keep referring everything that we're doing to like be better whatever it is because you'll never be perfect but you can

always get better okay well thank you very much Steve totally really appreciate it

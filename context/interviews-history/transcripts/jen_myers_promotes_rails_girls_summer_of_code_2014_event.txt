I hi it's Mike theme tastic i'm here at railsconf 2014 and i'm talking with Jen Mars today about the rails girls summer of code thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me today thank you so rails girls summer of code it's not the google somewhere Cody's right so rails girls in an organization of those workshops for women to learn more about

rails and so they have also organized a special thing called Summer of Code which is intended to get more women doing of a source work so it's three months from july-september that is paid scholarships for women to be able to work on open source projects hey and do they have to live in a certain area nope not at all we just have people who of the students will apply and kind of

self-organizing two teams and they can do it from from anywhere that they are okay so it's it's more of a scholarship where I be my hometown I could be in Oklahoma and you know but I'm interested in rails and nfe now interested in rails who applies for this by one was the application I think that may second is the ending application for students might it might ought to be passed with

US its published or when you're watching this but but you are so looking for coaches up through July great all the students that participate are really lucky because they get to have coaches so other people who have been doing rails for a while I want to help out their learning you can volunteer to be a coach do that and we can also contribute as a sponsor sit actually sponsor the

scholarships to make sure that we can fund the women to do these projects so the cultures they don't also have to be in a specific geographic area not that I'm no I don't think so i think as long as we can get everybody connected in a way that works for them then they can make it work yeah because some of the initiatives like this I've heard of require certain geographic options but

you're saying this is nationwide does it go overseas where is the son is 11 state actually a lot of the people organizing this are located in Berlin yeah which is one of the reasons I'm helping out supporting them and one of the reasons that they're not here to talk about it themselves yeah i mean i'm in chicago so i could do that so yeah it's anybody who can participate

or anybody who wants to participate those can and the nice thing about open source is that's the way it works too is it's something that people can jump into wherever they are and that's the same thing as going on here ok so it's it's targeted towards helping females who would like to get involved in open source gye if I were a young lady or even older woman who's looking at this

do I have to have like a lot of coding experience to do this are you what's the bar for well I think there's different levels most of the people who are participating in this know a little bit about code it's not necessarily an educational program or we get materials for that if you going through a rails girls workshop then you're probably going to be in perfect shape to do this

and I think it's primarily designed for women who have gone through a workshop and it's kind of like okay what do I do now she had Emily said and they said barrier to entry yeah and if somebody is interested in maybe doing this next summer throughout the year then take a rails girls workshop and then you'll be ready for next summer yeah ok yeah so he just a basic you have to have a basic

fluency and understanding of rails and that ecosystem to be able to participate but other than that and Sky's woman I think so yeah we're still that's why the reasons we have coaches in there too so that people are definitely going to be learning experience too and that's a positive thing are the coaches all it is this is this a female exclusive thing or no I don't believe so I believe that

anybody who wants to help the students throughout their projects can volunteer and I think having a lot you know all the volunteers that we can get to help the students do their projects is good ok so if you this will probably be out soon enough that if your person used experience rails teacher or developer you can reach out to the rails gross where what is her

website there is rails girls summer of code and org I think it's a whole long string org and they have a specific website just for the summer campaign it has all the information about how you can volunteer and donate and all about it will probably at least a strong together girls girls summer of code into Google it'll be great i'm sure you can get there yet is our twitter account

there is a twitter account which i think is rails girls SOC will server server code yeah so you can find all the information there too okay well thank you very much for thank you don't speak me appreciate it a good luck thanks user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for

yourself today yet you classic com you

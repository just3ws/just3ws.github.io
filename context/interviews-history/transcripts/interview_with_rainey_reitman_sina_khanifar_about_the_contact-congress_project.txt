hi it's mike with you casting i'm sitting down with Cena canna fire and rainy right men with who are involved with the eff and they're working a project called contact Congress thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me can you tell me a little bit about what contact Congress is and how you got started sure maybe I can kind of explain a little bit of the

motivation and then Cena can kind of explain how it works so the electronic frontier foundation is a nonprofit organization we're based in San Francisco California and we work on the intersection of civil liberties and technology issues so for example free speech online or privacy and fighting against surveillance and defending innovation and for many years now we

have been trying to harness the voices of Internet users and speaking out for their rights and in particular pressuring conference to do the right thing so you make policies that make sense for the internet and space technology and we really wanted a technology mechanism for people to reach Congress that would reflect our values but as some of you may know Congress

actually makes it very hard for constituents to hear from them they have these really painful forums that ask for all these things like your your address and your city and then also your exact zip code and then sometimes what topic you're having or what the your your you know whether you're ms or mrs. or mr. and and we were having to pay these terrible proprietary systems that didn't

work that great in order to do this and then one day we heard that sunlight foundation was actually working on a project that would be an open source system for contacting Congress and and that's when Cena and the eff got together and started to actually hack a solution to this do you want to talk about it soon yeah sure so we so basically it like really said there's

really complicated forms that you need to fill out if you want to email Congress and to real pain for users if you want to contact at all three of your representative it was about an issue that you care about you would go to each site individually and fill out this long forms so Sunlight Foundation started working on this project and they began by and creating basically what amounts

like an open data format for filling out these forms so for each representative or 500 and i think there's about 40 of them maybe 4545 representatives they created a file that describes how a computer can go through and programmatically fill out each of the form fields with the necessary information so you know that you think crazy things like requires zip plus

fours and which most people don't know right I'm looking up his non-trivial each of these fields we sort of labeled them and and and i created this data formatted let's sort of a computer system gopher go and fill out this information and sunlight foundation sort of started off and did a little test run and did all 100 and sentences and created data created files for each one

and then when we got involved the protected being sort of going for about six months their government senate is done but there was the big big task of getting all 435 House representatives members and that and so we made a big call to developers and and an RC F F's community in particular to come and help out and generate all these files yeah and we actually published an open letter

to the web developer community and said help us fix this project help us and we thought okay well I hope it works and it's probably going to take two or three four weeks and instead we were just inundated by support from the larger community there were just so many people that wanted to help us dozens and dozens of very talented web developers who stayed up round the clock for 48 crazy

hours hacking away to build out this open data format for the entire US Congress which means that now we have available not just for eff but for any nonprofit that wants to use it a mechanism for everyday users to get in touch with their members of Congress and speak out about the issues they care about yeah and that I have two questions but the first time when i ask is has

this this is already live in it sits out there where people can use it correct well yes and no the open data format is absolutely live at betty can go on github and take a look at it but for example eff hasn't switched over to using it because we need it like a front end for the system okay has anybody tried to use us to actually get any action or communicate

or broadcast to to all the to Congress so yeah I think sunlight foundation have a project called open Congress and which they're using it for actively and we're about to launch assistant amid eff as well that uses all the data we've been testing it over the last few weeks making sure that it runs well I'm going to be launching it and in the next couple of weeks okay and so looking back

at some of your earlier projects what the the day we fight back is this in inline with that because I recall that there was a project I don't know if it was the day we fight back but it used twilio to help with automated calls to to local representatives is this was that the day we fight back to did that's or yeah that's right so that David so this is kind of like one of the biggest

missing pieces for sort of grassroots activism so if you're a big organization and yet that this is a big organization that's been paying these fees but there's you know dozens of other really big advocacy organizations the green pieces and the ACL use of the world and when when you're doing advocacy work you know there's two two main cool section maybe three calls to action you have one

is cooling or representatives and that's a cool tool that we've had built for quite a while and it's open source and there's an emails and there's tweets and tweets it easy it's really simple to winning simple thing to build emails though like historically for the last you know five ten years since people have been emailing their representatives you've had to pay a third body to go

through and and be able to email them and they maintain proprietary data sets and charged a lot of money so if you're an individual or a small organization who wants to help people send emails that representatives it just wasn't possible so if I'm an application developer is trying to figure out how I want to be able to promote certain cause or you know sofa is coming back or

something like that I want to be able to create an application how people be more wear and get in contact this contact Congress a protocol that that's what I almost kind of sounds like could we I could you grab that use that and help to expose different people to who their Congress people are in and how to connect them exactly yeah we make it really easy and really simple and next

time there's a big online action it's going to be just so much easier to do the tech side of that kind of thing and it already started hearing from other groups that have totally I mean very little to do with our space like animal rights groups are interested in it and things like that and so it's for me it's very interesting when anytime we have ways that it makes it easier for the

community at large to make their voices heard in Congress and that for me is one of the most exciting things about this project great and so I'm to another further step back in speaking of freaky learning to about people's voices one of that the goals of you tastic is to help learn more about you guys and in or are you both and I'm just curious is what one motivated to you how did you get

involved in in online activism what what was is this year obviously it's not your first project but where did you start and how did that I get started I leave it to you who wants to go first go first I've seen it has such an interesting story so let me see how did I get involved so I'm the activism director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation I've been here at this will be my fourth year

here prior to that I was working at a nonprofit organization in San Diego that advocated specifically for privacy rights and there were definitely digital activism components to that but it was also activism that was very much offline so it well not offline so much as we did have some direct to consumer support we had like a little hot line that people who call and ask questions through and I

was doing that and then on the side for a while I was organizing what was then called the Bradley Manning support network and has since been renamed the chelsea manning support network which was an effort to advocate for the use whistle WikiLeaks whistleblower chelsea manning and i really felt i think probably a number of years ago before i started doing all that i had a

real intent moment where I I spent a lot of time thinking about you know what am i doing with my career with my life and what is this how I want to be spending my time and I decided I wanted to shift at a corporate work and move into the nonprofit space and I wanted to find a place where I felt like I could make a big difference in people's lives and that I could use my skills as writing to

to really affect change and that maybe I would never make it as much money as if I worked at some big corporate job but it was really important to me that I felt like my life had meaning and so I you know made the switch and I've been incredibly happy ever since Cena yet so my background is a little bit different I come mostly from like a start-up developer sort of world I've been doing

startup since I was in college and about a year would preserve almost two years ago now i left my life startup and Rex would randomly drifted into doing tech activism around cell phone unlocking which was an issue that I cared about a lot and started a white house petition and sort of it was kind of just like a that was kind of my wedge issue that got me involved and as always anytime I have

a problem I try and solve it by making a website so i started making all these website it's about the DMCA and cell phone unlocking and just realized how difficult it was to really build good good sites with the tools that are available particularly to individuals who didn't care and an issue and and so I started into I through that process I a got quite familiar with building

activist and websites and be good to know a lot of the people like rainy who work and do this kind of work and so in june of last year's almost exactly a year ago when the first snowden leaked started coming out and i got involved and helped out building the the website for the stop watching ads campaign and then since then with all the different leaks that have happened and at

different sort of sites they found the NSA the day we fight back and also I've sort of been organizing a group of volunteers who help and do this kind of work I'm called Task Force and so it's kind of how I got into it and generally I stick Lester act to the sort of the difficult part of organizing all the groups and making something happen and

more specifically just like the text side of it which is what i really enjoy right and so has has you choose me I have a terrible sore throat so I'm trying to be a trooper as I'm going through this so apologize the you mentioned with chelsea manning and with with with the Snowden era that from my perspective I'm seeing more interest it seems like in open government and it's

slowly starting to build and people are becoming more aware of this as something that you've noticed over the last few years you've been working in inside of online activism has it has there been an uptick and awareness and participation and it has it been a positive have have you ever had worked with law enforcement and other government entities and and had a positive relationship or how does

that work so it's a two-part question how is how has the your experience working with the community changed with some of the more high-profile topics that have come up in what has been your experience working with government or law enforcement agencies if you've had any in these cases with these projects yeah it's a tricky one I haven't been doing activism for that long so it's

hard for me to give a little perspective on on how I can dismiss changed over the last few years where you'd be able to talk more directly about that I mean law enforcement we definitely don't usually know undernet like rallies when the law enforcement of president I've never you know not really dealt with them I've done things like you know gone to Congress and met with staffers and I

think they're becoming a lot more educated about tech related issues I think developers are becoming a lot more engaged with the trying to build tools and mostly out of frustration right because dissatisfaction with with Congress and and with the government is so high I think people develops in particular ways trying to you know figure out what they can do to

sort of smooth over the process or make it run a little bit better so I mean as I've started paying attention to this I see more that there is a quite a vibrant community of developers working on different aspects of both activism and movement building through sort of tools to make democracy and government work better and truly fascinating see uh you know I would echo that that it's been

it's been a really interesting timing we're kind of in this era of the whistleblowers with big whistleblowers you've got your Manning and you're snowed in and and then this is and you're seeing them really pursued quite heavily by the government being a you know facing decades in prison being charged as spies under the Espionage Act and and at the same time I feel like

we're seeing massive amounts of coverage of issues like the the press has really swept in and started to use the data that we now know thanks to Snowden and thanks to Manning to write some phenomenal stories you know who look back at WikiLeaks coverage over the last few years I mean you're talking about all these New York Times stories in Washington Post stories and it's really

dominated our understanding of a whole bunch of foreign policy issues our understanding of America's overseas involvements in various Wars and and of course our understanding of domestic surveillance issues and I I think it's particularly important right now because if we look at obama obama came into office promising to bring the most transparent government ever that he was

going to open up the doors flood light into everything that we were going to have a better understanding of how our government works and instead of you know information freedom advocates have just been so let down by obama and in fact he has been incredibly assistance to transparency efforts and i have often thought that whistleblowers are sort of a stopgap measure when a government

absolutely cannot and does not embrace even the barest necessary amounts of of transparency then there's a role for whistleblowers guide by their conscience to do the right thing and I think that has created a real inspiration for people everywhere to talk about the role of transparency in government and i think the open government movement is thriving and it is one of the most

exciting sectors to be working in and it is something that is really going to fundamentally change our relationship with our government long-term and it's so interesting because you know software developers and technologists of all sorts are so central to that whole topic and so so that I would say it's been a very exciting time for me and then I also don't work with law enforcement

very much I don't ride to hear that for better for worse I yeah but when you mentioned about you know when we think about the results of people like Snowden and chelsea manning and how they're kind of being some of the penalties are some of the the risks of being whistleblowers i was more you know not just wondering about how people aren't become becoming more aware but if there's happen at any

pair i don't stoop Ranieri is not the word I want to use has it caused people to be a little bit more concerned about sharing this information with each other and coming together in participating in these communities you know if I if I find something out says I'm doing some kind of research into for example the in Chicago there was a nice project that looked at lobbyists information in how

where money was going and I was really curious when they came on it turned out that they realized that money was going to better places than they thought it was it was going more to hospitals at least they realized where it wasn't all just um cigarettes and Diet Coke lobbyists it was lobbyists trying to build libraries and in hospitals but when you go in there and you start to

dig you don't necessarily know what you're going to find and you might end up coming up with some dirt unintentionally it has been any concern about that or is that ever arisen in a project well I think this is an interesting time to be an investigative journalist in the United States you you see threats being made to journalists all the time you

know Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras who are the two reporters who did most the Snowden coverage for the better part of a year word nervous about coming back to the United States where give they going to be put in jail were they going to be held and forced to testify against Snowden where all their documents going to be taken from them when Glenn Greenwald's partner was traveling to a

tu Berlin I believe he had a stopover in Heathrow and was detained and not charged for nine hours under a terrorism act that they have in the UK and do nothing for being a journalist and you see investigations being launched into various reporters trying to get them to testify against their sources I think it is a an unfriendly environment in certain ways to investigative

journalists working with my sources that have a very interesting material and that's why so many journalists are now turning to technology solutions like for example a secure drop I don't know if you're comfortable talking about secure job senior I can yeah nice echo trucks not something I know as much as oh look secure drop without getting into it is just a technology project that makes it

easy for journalists to receive documents from a whistleblower without finding out the identity of the whistleblower secure a drop ah such their job I thought it was a fair job information no no secure drop and what's nice about that is it creates a technological safeguard to prevent you know the government can ever put pressure on that journalist to turn over

their source because i don't have the sources information they can't contact him or her and that I I see this sort of movement towards using technology to safeguard sources to safeguard freedom of the press to safeguard our for expression rights and I see early prototypes around this type of investigative journalism like WikiLeaks sort of leading the way and then I'm

very interested to see where journalism goes next five to ten years around that I don't know if that answered your question but I don't like free association answer no that's that that's I I don't have an answer that's why I asked you the the last thing I want to I want to bring up is that earlier you alluded to how the Obama administration has been not entirely forthcoming in in

some of the information but they did not that long ago relatively speaking put out the DIA I can remember the name of the site but where you can you can make requests for for Congress to be able to consider but you can make proposals to Congress and you can go on there you can say i'd like to have marijuana be Laws repealed in i think i'll talk about white house back though why house I've

got people right yeah yeah the website do you want to talk about it Cena yeah this is this is a point the rate of the rainy and I disagree on okay Graham so it's an interesting effort right and I think it's you know one of the first efforts of its kind particularly in that the Obama administration is actively responded to some my white house petition back in 2013 was one they

responded quite positively to and so I naturally have quite a positive view of that and that it helped me achieve my activism goals quite quickly I will preempt what r it will rain is about to say and there's her there's quite a few problems with it though right and in particular privacy issues around you know having to give your email information to the White House who may

then send you random emails about random campaigns I think it's really interesting experiment and I know that they're working on some things and the developers to allow us to sort of send them information and via different websites so for example you go to change the rule can send and send a sign a petition on the White House Taub gov website okay

which i think is is kind of cool interesting and so i think from a technological standpoint it's kind of interesting they haven't been responding to a lot of petitions is enough there's one of the other big issues there's a big one on a chloroform that's been outstanding for god knows how many months now and so it's effective to a degree you know it has its advantages

and disadvantages but i'll let rainy last a little bit well I actually have come around a little bit on the White House petitions thanks to suna advocating for them internally here I so the problem she mentioned before I think there are some privacy problems I actually went ahead and signed up on to the White House mailing list because I wanted to see what kind of stuff they

sent me and it's all this you know kind of propaganda style you know this is what the White House is doing to you no honor our veterans on Veterans Day that kind of thing not let's like very kind of feel good stories not really a substantive stuff and they they do let petition sit on responded to four months I think fundamentally my biggest problem with it is there are so many phenomenal

activism campaigns out there that are on different sites and I feel a lot of times like going to the White House website to put your petition there it's kind of like going to the free speech zone at a protest like you can be over there and that's where you're allowed to have your free speech and everyplace else in the world that's that's not we're not even going to listen to that

that's not going to make a difference whereas I think there are so many places where you have hundreds of thousands of people speaking out and doing things and then their voices have just as much a right to be heard as anybody using the White House website so i and i am a i'm also a little bit irritated because they respond to petitions that hit a certain threshold and they just Robert orally

choose that threshold and then they increase it whenever they want so I think that it does have some technological aspects that are interesting I as an activist I find it a little limiting okay yeah that because I was what I was going to get it was that it sounds like what I've observed is a they don't respond to everything and and but what I was ultimately wanted to get

to you is how people see the whitehouse gov and they look at it this is 0 this is how you send an email to to our government this is this is the this is the channel to get through to them but then there's other organizations like eff who are trying to build multiple channels to reach the right target for for specific requests in and having the government

come out with a site like change a door or what house gov does that is that helping or hurting the mission that the eff is trying to work on it and that projects you're trying to do or is it i'll stop by saying so you know the whitehouse.gov website at best lets you contact the executive branch right that it doesn't get you anywhere in congress and this is something I'm acutely aware

of because the White House came out for cell phone unlocking a year is passed be multiple bills in the house but and you know once personalized but nothing's passed Congress yet so you know having having the White House do that is one thing but it doesn't affect actually getting bills passed in Congress at all and there you know there's been rumors if the house representatives doing

something very similar to this for quite some time the problem is that like right it's a really difficult problem for the government to solve internally I think because like look at the winner people website in you know in how many years I mean the next one the next president is elected is he going to maintain any of these outstanding questions what's going to happen to all this information about

the individuals who've signed up and the questions that they passed and will they even implement well you know will the next president you can control meant anything vaguely similar and does even President Obama have any you know real reason to answer any of the questions that remain on the platform now that he's not up for reaction again right so there's all these questions about what

happens to the data and what happens to you know how long is that program actually going to last and how much is it going to be improved on I think whitehouse.gov site could be really great if it was iterated on and improved and if some of the some of the concerns that for example rainy races were addressed more actively but I think it's really really unlikely that

going to happen in the long run yeah and I just you know I think this is a really big kind of philosophical question for digital activists who are trying to do sort of grassroots organizing in online platforms which is like how do you make people's voice heard and when we think about corporations like big companies they know exactly how to make their voice heard in Congress they do it

through money they just throw a lot of money at the problem and it their issues are resolved and for the rest of us it's very very very hard to find effective ways to make it clear what the people want to their members of Congress in part because people feel like Congress doesn't listen and that's partly because Congress doesn't listen and it's also because uh because it's it's there's

there's not a very good channels and mechanisms so I was interested to see the whitehouse.gov petition site I'm interested in the work that we were doing to make it easier to email Congress what I want to see is more and more innovative ideas coming into this space that we should have let a thousand flowers bloom let's see all the difference we can find to get technology

to help us speak out to Congress because we need to find ways to make sure people's voices are being heard look but the one thing I wanted to know was has it gotten in the way of the work you're doing with eff though has it has it has the reason i ask that is I think of it like Starbucks moves into a small town and they have the money and the advertising camp of clout to get the

choice spot and everybody sees them and knows them and they think I'm just going to go to Starbucks and then they kind of squeeze out some of the smaller independent organizations like an eff and I just wondered if there'd been a squeeze on the work you're doing because of people just saying all I've already done a whitehouse.gov petition I I don't need to look at the eff I'm I've already

I've got that is that is have been anything you've experienced well so I'm Cena can also answer this and then I am gonna probably have to get going right after this question I hope that's okay no I would just I would just a wrap up by saying that you know hasn't been a squeeze on eff one thing I'd say the only problem I've really seen that came as a result of the White

House petition site existing is that other organizations will sometimes think that the whitehouse.gov site is more effective as a platform because you're supposedly guaranteed a response if you can get over the threshold and so sometimes coalition's of different organizations will say well let's put it up on the whitehouse.gov site and then we have all those trade-offs that we

talked about before so I you know I just wish sometimes that other advocacy groups were a little less enthusiastic about the platform because they kind of thought through some of the long-term things i think the dangling carrot of getting response from obama is very enticing and i can certainly appreciate that but i don't think that's it necessarily makes it the only really

good actors and platform out there so it's a mixed bag it doesn't hurt eff in any substantial way but in a lot of ways the FF isn't like some tiny little grassroots organizations are actually a fairly substantially you know large organization with members all over the world so it helps so perhaps we are better able to survive the onslaught of the white house petition site than your

average little tiny nonprofit so what when the political winds blow and whitehouse gov might fall away eff will still be here will still be there yeah you know what I mean I agree with that sentiment it said eff go okay well you know we've had a nice conversation I want to say thank you very much is there anything else you'd like to to let people be know about or you'd like to

say before we go no no I think that's it thank you so much for having us sure thank you very much for sharing alright have a great day thanks man user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yep you guessed it calm

you

user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's Mike again with you tasik so here at go to accomplish cago they haven't kicked me out yet I'm sitting down with Dan north dan is well known as

the kind of the father of BDD but not be fer you are the one who wrote the first paper description and first implementations and I also think it's fascinating that you're having a kind of a kind of class who likes to question dogma over years yes I last seven years BBD has become dogma either you do it or you don't you and you can't redo the TDD got a DVD and there's all these things

and be mature person who questions dogma what does it like to be somebody who created something who's now them except it has a dogmatic thing as a dogma I think yeah um so this to me comes down to experience so what happens is when you have someone who is new to something when there are novice in a particular area they want to just find a thing that works and want to be told what to do

they want rules they want structure and they want to be able to follow a recipe and they want to get quick wins in that way into sort of part of learning theory is that this is how we operate while we gain context and mobile gain experience and once you've got a bunch of experience in a bunch of context we could start making good decisions right now what happens is people will pick up

something without any context so right well then this this must be how it works and they're really uncomfortable as I was talking about with uncertainty they don't like the idea of uncertainty they don't like the idea that we can't know some things and so there are they'll fill in the blanks and this is what we do so BDD and I've deliberately never written down i mean i wrote introducing

me today article never really been that descriptive or prescriptive about what it is and what it isn't because to me it isn't a set of practices it's a way of engaging and it's a way of it's a way of trying to get work done it's already thinking about a problem yeah and and Liz chaos is this really watch is basically it's about the conversations right okay

everything comes back to the conversations and so you know I said it at all recently like the only be DD tool that matters is one in your head but that's everything else is just a detail and so you get the kind of the camps that are the another aspect camps like Jay behaved Hampton the cucumber cups and all these guys and then and then this world of misinformation about BD is

this immediate Latin be the only works at this high level and and then you use TDD down and whatever and I think a lot of that is a basic misunderstanding of what tdv is and what I was trying to do with BD v and we're nice ended up so I think with anything as long as soon as it around for any length of time people will become dogmatic about it yeah there's that there's a there's a subset

of people as if you know that there's a type of people if you like who are going to pick up on something and especially when they start making that their thing I confess selling you know I'm a ddd consultant then they've got a sound pretty definite about things this is this is BD D and this isn't me this is why you should listen to me yeah this is why you listen to me so why'd you pay

back right you know um so I i have a working theory it's only a theory i have no data only it's only only only observational which is that people start selling certifications things were well like yeah like any of those things when when they think it's the last good idea they're going to have so there's a yeah i'm going to monetize this thing now I never wanted to

monetize b.ed because I don't think it's you know it's just it's a useful thing it's usually shouldn't monetize ideas that's that's crazy well rather you shouldnt trying to lock down ideas there's a kind of lovely quote if you want an idea to travel you shouldn't try and travel with it okay I really like that yeah I mean you look don't assign it to your personnel no no very much

like here you go so I print out this so beanie these started as me trying to coach TDD better because TDD so awesome I love to you I love them the thinking that goes in TVD and though you know you've heard me bashing on TV play i'm not i'm bashing on TV these sellers because i'm bashing on the zealots right it's automate it's like it's not really tdd is a pattern right okay it's a

pattern in the classic Alexandrian sense of a pattern it's a strategy that works well in a particular situation in a certain context it resolves some forces it introduces other forces and it needs to be used in conjunction with a bunch of other patents so there are places where the is the first thing I reach for his TV right there are other places where it's just going to slow me down or

it's going to be irrelevant or is it gonna leave me to a wrong solution you know so so when people say or dare nor does an OT DD that's that's it's almost sounds like that dog my trying to find the conflict where it really isn't it yeah it's make its making up a phantom enemy and and that's part of it I think part of it as well is it makes a good sound bite yeah you know Dan north is

advocating copying and pasting code I I am right as there's a certain context in which I want to copy and paste code and the context is very specific and I describe it to one of my accelerated HR pans or ginger cake and the point about it is it's a pattern it works in a certain context that doesn't say you should always copy and paste code or you should never copy in basic Otis has

given these constraints in this environment in this context it's the useful strategy to have any okay yeah yeah and that it's that when it's towards that level of mastery were I wonder if part of the dogmas people just don't feel confident enough also that there's one Saruman take a step back and I'm going to just go back to what you talked about with the last idea

I've heard that the reason that they want to charge money for its president they think it's gonna be the last idea they I've heard that in with music as well I've heard it as an argument why is our own that's how many songs does an artist have in them and if they don't charge for him how do they know that they're going to have another hit and if they don't protect your copyright how do

they know they're going to obviously right so it's been thinking I've got a hit here so I yeah okay la yeah so that was it sounds like there's a human way of thinking about problems it isn't unique to software development it is it's just humans do this when we're confronted with a fear of this is all I've got yeah yeah maybe I certainly a Linda Riesling we talked about it since

I lost the version also the outside the idea that you have a thing and you might lose the thing is much more compelling than so she was talking about reward structures and she said if you offer someone a bonus for doing something it actually it ends up being a disincentive like all the data says it ends up being a business centers that the damn pink strive and they are there's a ton of

there's a ton of research madness he's one of them turned eight and that all sort of behavioral economics school um but that if you present it as I've already given you this bonus but you'll lose it if you don't reach these targets people will work extra mile to hit those targets okay so it's not even those hypothetical its here's your cure it but my take it away yeah if the risk of

losing a carrot is more effective than a carrot yeah or a stick yeah it's to offer the carrot as a thing that you could leave I can see how that is because I can be like I have this carrot you're going to take it away versus I don't have a carrot I don't lose anything but you know I might work all the way it's in line and not get it I have to say even what

you describe is I've seen these bonuses that companies were now when I come business we're going to offer a bonus to you for performance I've been enough companies were always something that bonus time was you know we weren't doing so hot last year yeah well tough yeah yeah yeah we're gonna pull that dinner she's not just my new boat yeah yeah yeah yeah and people will leave I mean

you'll actually lose people right by doing that because of the the lawsuit they know lost that thing in their own right yeah I knew you had that thing in Alister right so they rose over there's a great interview with Alanis Morissette randomly in a lot of music frankly and I just met her second album so first albums are angry angry music yeah and then a second album she's met this guy

and she's really in an hour which is really happiness his album happy songs things I've done much but there's not much data is actually it's a good outlet some solid songs on there but it's a happy album and and they were saying like all your fans are really furious because you know you're not writing is angry music and just like I don't write angry music or a music about how I'm

feeling yeah I was angry so angry music I'm happy as I wasn't happy music yeah I like this myself to the first ave yeah yes yeah well this is the end yeah exactly and it's like you know I i I'm a fan of yours and i want to i want i want you to carry on being angry because I associate with you and and you get um yeah in our industry I think this there's something about as well there's

a cult of personality thing where you associate someone with something and and that can become a reinforcing League yeah so there's folks certainly in a commercial end of the industry who do do one thing I they do that one thing again and again and again again and it's level you know are you stuck there like move that thing forward that thing was great it was a great solution for the problem

you head in that context what's the new context what what has that move forward I'm someone who's the antithesis of that it's all at Michael feathers who's always always on something new he's always like his boys brains always going he's always coming up with ideas you know he wrote this book about legacy code about a hundred years ago which is still a classic

deserves a place on every programs bookshelf and he's just doing crazy crazy other stuff now Chinese looking at how codebases evolved over time and all this you know every time I see him speak it's fascinating it's new it's a no it's taking ideas forward and so there are folks who you know the only Association i have but Michael is it's going to be interested right right do you mean

that's not our apartment is very interesting and it's the i call it the the noun problem once you get a noun is your middle name that's if I like you know you're you're the legacy code guy or you're the BDD guy then you're kind of like wall yeah I'm doing other stuff as well I really was one step on that journey and and also if you look at it as a little ecosystem there's I'm not

I'm not what the action is all right look at guy cottage with specification my example is care with the bd4life stuff you look at Chris mats and oliver marson with the road options and I all of these things are kind of going off in really interesting crazy directions yeah and I'm looking at that going wow joelie know i'm really enjoying seeing that from the others other side of that

assembly is like I remember reading your post about BDD background yo know six or seven and I was dhruv down that at the time in I remember just you know being like oh this is you know this is really great wanting to figure out how to do this and Donna because I hadn't been defined yet but I can understand that urge to want to look at the first person the first person who initiated it and

maybe not necessarily trusting those that came after in when you're looking and you're trying to figure out what this thing is you're trying to understand and get some my that i can remember continually going back to your blog and trying to get more information out of kids yeah I needs but nobody's but multiple we're in some of me just thinking on the idea and saying

how do we talk about this idea it was more of well how do I understand more about what that person was trying to say and then it becomes well so I could see how that that thought process can evolve in people who are looking at these ideas well this is mrs. why I i name dropped as seriously as I do is what I want is that when people come searching for you know for me because of BDD that you know

pretty the first or second thing they see will be me talking about Liz or talking about going or talking about Chris or via these guys because then it got up well that somewhere else I can look and and it creates that Association eric evans that's the same thing with the main driven design he'll talk about and you know the folks who have taken that on and and and devolved that and

develop that so you go look at pretty much any of these talks and he's talking about what other people are doing with with his ideas which is fantastic yeah it sounds like a great a generational thing in osaka nice you see these things evolved and it's a different mindset between that i have to push people down to lift myself up first i'm going to build people up in this i'd build them

up i'll come up with that well it's the zero-sum game thing it's like I I don't believe in kind of slicing up a pie I believe in like a bigger pie generate right cuz then that's that everyone everybody's y'all have a lot of fine yeah we let apart yeah awesome this applies kid um yeah okay well going to so many different conferences and speaking to different types of audiences

one things I've talked to some speakers mothers how do they prepare and how do they maybe change the messages or how do you or do you change your message when you're talking to a predominantly job audience or predominantly agile practitioners people who are identified themselves as agile they become do when you are going to be talking about your topics do you adjust

what you're going to say for the audience or if you say I am a message and I'm just keep repeating that specific message so now who was that I think it was someone like Rebecca Carlson is the CTR thought works said to me what I was sort of a big deal i said to her i felt nothing about BBB favor and I said if you've got an idea and it's a good idea you'll just find the EQ

playing again and again and again and again because people need to hear it again and again and again and you're going to go los different audiences and and you're going to keep saying that message now that's if you're trying to get a particular idea across what I find is and I was looking back I forgot like I know 40 or 50 different tools I've given over around eight years or

something across all kinds of different topics and what I'll try and do even if I'm giving the same talk again on the same title and abstract kind anything so it's the same as the ruffed is largely the same message I'll always try and refresh it and because it may be that in a theater talk I gave six months ago my thinking's moved on and I looking at like oh do I still think those things or

have I tuned that message or actually this thing came out of an ambiguous until I were kind of tweak it so I'm constantly tweaking my talks constantly tweaking well yeah trying to move the ideas for what I mean I I had a massive epiphanies probably the right word in the last couple years with the accelerated agile stuff I went from being a big a a job consultant and a

bigger agile consulting firm I me know if it works isn't doesn't have a named methodology if you like they'll use whatever works in a situation a very pragmatic in that way but there was very much it'll works feel of doing agile right and the kind of clients i'll be working with heavy enterprising organizations but he needed to move in a help them move at

the speed they could move up and then I nothing his tiny little team doing crazy stuff and and I had to rethink a whole bunch of stuff so I was in I was easily iconic last thing I there a whole bunch of like for me real core truths like that I got you guys in silly believed about a house on fling it written that I've found myself challenging and what I try and do in those situations you can

either just go lalala and we write back in my in my happy place or trying to simulate that and so that's where I've ended up now and someone was asking me about like why I call it accelerated a jalar not the past agile and isn't matter what isn't that time for new thing and the I think the main discovery I've made or main realization i've come to over the last couple of years is the

thing i've been working with and the thing i've been in a dime now trying to document is agile right as in the manifesto rather than agile as in the methodology right there the methodologies infected the core principles yeah yeah and and you know and people over process suggests that people interactions are more important than any process ergo as soon as you

start defining that as a process you've systemically set up to fail right you know there is a dogma around scrum there is a dogma around Kanban there is a dogma around BDD there is a dogma around all these different things XP XP had to 12 Commandments you know you talk to Kennebec about XP and that's the opposite of anything he wanted people to be thinking right he's very much he's

entirely values-driven you know he's very much like the whole point for him the whole point of the first book was you know communicate a communication simplicity feedback or the other core values oh by the way here's some things did it on this really cool project was it support here's my supposed to support that and it was experiential it was like we've done this and these are the things

that we found that worked that you have to do this right and and then that became you know and he also had his lovely picture of how they support each other and work on it was a patent diagram it was a diagram of result of resolving forces and patterns like he thinks in patents he's one of those guys and unfortunately people wanted rules and the point about

pattern is its contextual the point about rules is there not and so people took all these pattern there's all these really good ideas like TDD like pair programming is brilliant in many situations it's not a thing you should you know it's not guys that there are no silver bullet right including that automation automation has a evil darkside as soon as you automate

something you're locking that thing you're now making that thing brittle right yeah um which may be okay maybe you want fast and repeatable at the expense of malleable but it is at the expense of your right great yes there's always trigger yeah and all of these things and so um so dogma I come and bring him right back to the opening question and I think dogma comes from

where we don't have context or where we have fear I think those two things tend to be very closely related so the more context we have the more experience we have the more we understand a situation the less fearful we are all the less irrationally fearful we are right so it is it all comes down to Yoda it always comes out yet yeah well thank you very much for taking the time to stop me

really appreciate it thank you Thanks okay that's good user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you cast a calm you

user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's quite a few task again so now with Jason logic who is speaking here at the web missions 2013 at the gene siskel film center in chicago and Jason's told

me about his group called yolks for good which is a organization that pairs top designers with nonprofits and helps with sewing the needs that they have to do their social good so thanks for taking time to sit down with me Jason I really appreciate it so so what is UX for me sir great so first of all honor to sit down with you thank you very much for inviting me so you xfer good is a annual

event a partner and I created or founded three years ago now and it brings together some of the top designers around the world in pairs them with some crazy nonprofit social challenge I and over a four-day span we immerse ourselves in the problem space and then on the back end of those four days we generate ideas through the synthesis of all that collection of knowledge and

sleeping ourselves so when you say immerse what what maybe can you give an example of a profit nonprofit you worked with sure and how you approach that meant did the immersion sure so i'll start with last year as an example so last year we myself and my other co-founder jeff leitner who runs up the insight lamps which it was kind of the platform that you look for good was born

out of and it was born out of the space of jeff working with leading nonprofits and trying to rethink kind of break apart their models and stitch them back together is kind of a think tank right and the work that he was doing alongside the work that I was doing in the UX phase merged to say hey wouldn't it be an interesting exercise and warm that we feel is too often limited in terms of

having really talented designers and leveraging the way that they see the world right at the believe that they bring to the table fact that they kind of see the unseen if you worry well right and so would it be interesting if we partnered them together and give them an opportunity to try to address some of these challenges so great so we're doing this a few years

now last year as an example worked with the grammys and their nonprofit foundation called musicares in more lines okay to tackle to social challenges really one was about access to greater access to social services and a music community down there and the other one was positioned really around financial means and stability for musician music is such a fabric of the

tuning of that of that city of it yep new normally it is music oh yeah totally right and so when you look at it that way what's challenging about it is the standpoint that there is an abundance of resource what happens well it's highly competitive and save them the prices and the ability to kind of you know pay for your own livelihood to write warcraft goes down right so it's highly

competitive you get a club gig or whatever so you mean right up with a lot of things like street corner musicians and musicians leaving the city to go on tour to command higher trips out yeah right exactly and so the other thing that's interesting about that is that and New Orleans as a city does not taking tours and focus the music isn't part of their necessarily their

marketing of the tourism attraction and and that's unlike a Nashville or in austin right where it's kind of a big component to it and so that's also very interesting right it's very specific yeah as an example you know the average income for sushi New Orleans is 27 thousand dollars a year right and they have a city of a few hundred thousand people and have millions of visitors

that come to the city a chair if you were to you know figure out a way to introduce more dollars from those tours and visitors right into the hands of musicians so you could potentially have an uplift of the annual salaries begin average income for those in museum it should be the money across a broad spectrum of society correct that one person so that's kind of on the

financial side of things and then you can also look at like the opportunity for those musicians are Street corn use issues to think about like other digital ways to help solve some of these challenges like to jump can we richa ties this aspect of tip charged we work with club owners of any winners to put you know access the digital tools in the hands of musicians right in band etc

that can enable tourists you say and really like I want to engage with this musician group and now I want to provide some level things aren't great side of the band right so you're working with non-property mornings and you're trying to pair up some designers with them what was the specific engagement sure sir over four days we brought in folks from Rome country from Twitter and Google

bhama for America and for manifest digital we're among the cosine practice there and basically from all over and who had thought about the dynamics and the team chemistry of the skills the briefing table solve those challenges soon we immerse ourselves in years with from folks at running radio local radio station retro Graham first to ban managers to club owners to going into

clubs and actually talking musicians themselves folks playing instruments on the street corner right so run the gamut in terms of who are all newest releases who that hustler is what they're capable of these already are yeah really start a really certain exam right and then take all that data and start to say well what can we learn from that what complete views right mind you also partnering

with other great organizations like sweet home New Orleans and the Jazz and Heritage foul this themselves right to then come synthesize it come up with as many ideas as we can right and again both around social service savings so report out provide things ideas to those organizations those ideas are kind of out in a while continuing that was last

year right this this year in a partner dollarama center in vancouver british columbia and that challenge was specifically around establishing a greater basic social and emotional learning in the school system it's already semi established away but they need to build a bigger ground swamp right get that out there's a lot of science and research that goes behind it

you know sue that's great but what we found through our work with them is that the kind of was playing a bit of a defensive approach right and they need to kind of approach it from advocacy and put tools and resources in the hands of parents and teachers and other educators within the community to help drive focus around this aspect of social emotional learning which comes down to things like

altruism and social responsibility empathy and all sorts of really wonderful things that right now that are established in human beings all those patterns are all established in human beings by the age of seven right right and and then that those patterns are carried forward for the rest of independent individuals life so how you do that right well you do that by

talking with school administration and officials educators from kindergarten all the way through high school are people who are heavily involved in creating educational program services within the community and then you go into the school you sit in your talk with students so you know I spent an entire day and Kate through three school and talking with teachers in the break

room and sitting in on classroom activities and participating in those right it's really watching observe like crayons are fun what's happening right yeah well I mean it was you know one of the instances would a lot about how to deal with emotions right and one girl in particular at a hard time expressing her feelings and should be teacher immediately went to

saying use your emotion we love emotion teach student pad on the wall yeah I said they won up to it and they turn the dial to ord sad yeah and two it's hard for a you know a small child to express that verbally like what's going on but they can identify with their emotions point to a picture and say that's why I feel ya right so that's then started to elicit conversation between the teacher

right it kicked into ok let's examine it start kind of poking at that and see like wires what's matter right tell him right and starting to kind of talk about those feelings will talk about which cause and goes right so then the root cause get them done drugs right it was a really eye-opening experience to see mine some of these types of activities and simple tools and teachers are not

school district community or leveraging to create better human beings were absolutely fast okay so mean same kind of process ruin a processor pet we had designers from around the world which was great two days of immersion add a synthesis and lastly we came on drew yeah it's reported out our ideas one of the ideas was this nation around about how hard she works which was online

resource were students are students teachers and parents unity about exercise and activity over what to do with your your kids right so if you wanted to have an a 10-minute exercise around how do you address the uniform of bullying or something I do that right that resources are not all chanting it's nice that idea was actually that I hurried forward into of luck wishes I'm

so chocolate happen on okay well late May until the worst day period we actually built a prototype functional prototype retweet present stupid dollar comma 7 and now inside look oh yeah it's exactly and that's either the auspice some people Dali Lama season we identify and need an organization around then work together to you to say okay we're going to do

this a specific study do a few days of study then you get together and we'll do that actual were what is you create a prototype all right she seemed everything inside yeah take that to a hackathon okay we need to implement this design or let's work through this great yeah so it's a it's some identifying and understanding proverbs baseman Cano get there getting that background context of

designer so they can start to understand what they're dealing with we get that situated stakeholders and redesigning where would get the commercial inside of that all your auntie makanda that means include immersive experience bringing they brought anyway complete game synthesis of what our findings are to generate my things off those president back key constant competition those

concepts get believe it and i think bagon a non-profit to continue those ideas carry something to confess ah tons have been a loose organization student 22 stop energy x4 good calm and up there's so much time she turns each other babe it 12 everywhere those late nights some of those a bit work yeah bitch mom going to be talking about as a personal reflection its designees

velocity and really it's kind of rawness genesis of a signer right you know it doesn't doesn't turn off right your personal and professional max you're so well-versed i'm glad that it doesn't turn off and show what winds up happening your your personal life affects how you design and flooring interest your kind of way of thinking about how you approach problems it was

integrated exactly so that's a little about mutants to pay thank you for taking the time stop thanks rowdy I appreciate it user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yep you guessed it calm

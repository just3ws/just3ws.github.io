hi it's mike with you task i'm here at go to comp 2014 i'm sitting here with sydney strike who helps with go to come and help is it help is a big word she's been involved in helping to decide the location the finally deciding at chicago and all at ford searching scouting for locations and then a lot of other stuff that's involved in i just want to say thank you very much for taking the time

to speak with me certainly i saw what does helping me in the beginning it was finding a venue that would actually take us because chicago's very much a convention town right so all the hotels are used to saying well if you're going to stay with us you have to guarantee that every attendee will book a room right and they want a huge financial guarantee right up front that's not our

model our model is to appeal to the local community we do have people coming in from as far away as Poland at someone just yesterday oh right but mostly this is is for the the local community no so you know we're here in your tube and we're back at the Drake Hotel um you know when you were looking back now let's say over two years ago three years ago now up and coming and talking to the

hotels what was finally brought you and what was so my criteria used to decide on going with with the Drake in particular well all the rest of the hotels said you know this is our model financially and put up or shut up so we looked at a number of other venues trying to find some place that would fit because we like to have enough space we like to have great catering as well as

the ability to interact with speakers for all the attendees this hotel had a recent acquisition of a new a sales manager came in and I approached her and said so you know we spent a lot of money on catering because everybody must have a good time an easier they'll stay in and coffee or soda and all that all that stuff and they the conversations in the hall are just as important

as the conversations in the are the sessions of the providers right so they were actually willing to be flexible they went to management and said so let's look at something different let's try this so I kind of the lesson I'm not taking from that is if you're looking at up at a location don't just take that first one you're going to have to go in there any dig and and I think I looked

at 20 hotels as you always a couple of public venues around the city so yeah so that was probably a lot of footwork right there yes lots of emails that's phone calls um but to go to the other aspect of it from from the venue to the community what about the Chicago community and again on the part of the Chicago community saw one here nice things but in all seriousness so you've

probably had a lot of choices across country what was it about Chicago that that made it a destination for gochu well it actually came out of a conversation that happened when we were doing consulting and I was working with Dave Thomas and a number of other people and we had a large project here in Chicago and one night over beer it was why is there no major software

development conference in Chicago when there are all these great tech people and lots of technology companies but there isn't a focused software development conference and that was eight years ago okay so you know it was seeing a lot of talking thoughts that have come from a long time from a long time yes yeah and Chicago seems to be if it we have a nice technology base here

there's a diversity of technologies it's a really fun place to come it's an easy place to get to four speakers because of o'hare being a central airport yeah so we have o'hare and midway yep you know that much rather comes from all over I know that's what I take for instance you know Michael Nygaard he said one of our speakers this year is a great great speaker but he's up in Minnesota and

he's like it's great to be able to come to a conference where I only have to get on one airplane oh yeah not too many transfers it's a pretty direct fit or is it that's actually of us may be our day is dry and from depend where it is yeah but also you were looking at your go as being kind of ripe for heavy a major conference contract and working with the communities one of the unique

things that I've got experiences that you don't just come in and plant a flag and say we're going to host a conference you do some smile preach and interaction work with user groups and other local communities can you describe how you keep actually also how to describe how you came to the idea of doing that kind of interaction well this is a conference about software development but it's also

by software developers that community is skeptical of always about about value and they want to know that there's value so they don't believe you know a marketing person like Maynard they want to hear it from a developer so it just seemed to be a natural outreach to reach out to those developer groups like all the meetups that are in town one of the problems of course is that they are

skeptical so they don't always answer my emails when I say we have a network of over a thousand speakers that we vetted and we can pick from them and invite them and they'll come because we ask them to write and we so you know we like to pair to improve the the offerings in the community with the user groups and provide them with a tech talk evening right um as well as the go two nights

ago two nights exactly yeah um so you know I will send an email to you know all the organizers of a given right need up and say hey you know we'd love to pair with you will bring you a speaker and we'll pay for it right um and all we want to do is to be able to you know stick up our go-to banner you know it's all about the speaker as opposed to go to yeah there's definitely a value even

if you did nothing with as user group organizer even if I did nothing with go to you after that it's it's a great opportunity to just have somebody come in and bring in a fresh talk or fresh idea that might come from outside of the normal sphere of love local talent we try to bring you somebody who's not normally here right okay and was that something that you did for the first

time with go to or that that does that idea come from previous experience I where did that idea to do this kind of outreach come from the one out the person I know that doesn't the most and the start of this was was Dave Thomas right when he started with ya who is the kind of the parent company for for go to he was doing it in Australia and he's been doing that in Australia for nine

years okay networked well there so it works well they're brought the birth our concept here so it seemed to be the the natural way to evolve a conference here so so if I'm in the in a region that it's looking at go to and seeing success here in Chicago and I think that I'm in you know I'd say Minnesota st. Paul Minnesota for example just because we talked about Minnesota in and I'm

thinking you know we could we have a tech community that could support a go to conference and I think it financially viable what are some of the things I need to think about what I want to reach out to you like what would you like to hear that that would make it so that way it would be financially feasible to bring something like a go-to to your city well if you're going to be in a

place that's hard to get to buy an airplane you better initially I better have a list of sponsors or say that we're going to help support this right in is it also being able to present like the the actual community itself on if you look at all of those things yes okay for one thing you know we started talking to all the speakers we know about and we're thinking about doing a

go-to in Chicago what do you think and they were all Oh Chicago would be great we'd love to come to Chicago right because part of at least is that it's a great destination and it's also easy to get to and speakers the good speakers are busy and they travel a lot so you know sending them someplace that takes 10 or 12 hours to get to yeah so so sometimes you're just if you're too far

remotes it's going to be yeah it's pretty it's gonna hard because that's one thing that I think is is missing in understanding why these conferences are so expensive when I you look at it and I know I've suffered the sticker shock many times self and twelve hundred dollars for two day conference oh my gosh I can't you know like work that out or my company

won't work that out but there's a reason for that that that that dollar that that price it's not it's not just an arbitrary number like last year you were describing that he actually wasn't even profitable it was not we lost money last year hey on investment so yeah so but me and then here you are so yet again so you still see enough value to please Lucy a future okay because yeah one of

the reasons that we have a long list of speakers is that we do treat them well and so if we say we're going to take care of you they're more like they trust us to do that and coming to a conference so that takes that relationship that we've had I'm sorry I've lost my train there that whether what you should put through with a speaker community yet so that they want to come out that's right

in and be part of the conference yeah because that was an interesting aspect is that like you don't have a speaker room now I don't that you you push the speakers are you know you're gonna go talk to people yes well that's one of the reasons to put out a little really good food and you may have noticed it just kept going right there when I break in another break and then there was

lunch so then there was another break right so including mimosas to start the morning yeah yeah I saw that I I I knew I had a long day so I didn't get it on tape they look delicious well in the whole point is to get people to stay out in the halls when they're not in it in a in a listening to a presentation so that you gypsy do get to walk up to Adrienne carcroft four inches and say and engage

him in a conversation right oh it certainly made my job here I know so alright well let's say thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me thank you very much and thank you for letting me come and do these interviews go to comp they've been a lot of fun two years in a row very good like thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas

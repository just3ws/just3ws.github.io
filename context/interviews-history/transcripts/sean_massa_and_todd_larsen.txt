hi i'm mike with you tastic sit here with Sean masa and Todd Larson who are involved with the the Chicago nodejs community hi guys can you tell a little bit about what what you guys are dealing with node here in Chicago yeah sure the group started in about March of 2011 so I think we've had like 16 meet up so far so it's not really new but it's not really that yeah either like middle-aged

for user day I suppose it is but we do have like over 450 registered members too so it's definitely something that the community has been interested in since we started it but yeah we just get together every month and talk about what's going on with node what people are working on what packages are coming out so what philosophies people are coming up with in conventions yeah like

that note is one of those communities it's really come up really fast I am I mean professed faster than Ruby but I mean I just kind of wonder if some of that is because people have been doing JavaScript so they had already kind of accepted JavaScript monologist oh I can do some more with the languages that have been something do you get a lot of people who have like a lot of JavaScript

experience but no nodes that one over note i mean what's kind of the audience what I've kind of noticed is it's actually more people that come from other maybe back-end technologies wanting to learn about node there are definitely people that have transitioned from like front-end strictly front-end development doing JavaScript and now they kind of want to move into the back

and sort of things yeah yeah but they also you'll get the people who just do a little bit of JavaScript maybe just some jquery stuff and then no it actually legitimizes javascript for them and they slow to get more interested in not just note but even with more advanced like client-side libraries Sony and you know that also do you have like a more mixed audience at your meetings because you

knowed like Ruby doesn't have the greatest story on Windows by node seen something really embraced by like ash and like I know the azure group and they run note do you get a more of a mixed bag of attendees oh yeah it's we have actually a surprising amount of Windows people yeah man yeah it's definitely you know linux people because note is

multi-platform that's one of the big selling points we definitely get a bigger spread of people yeah for sure you see a little bit more mixing and this yeah and a large spread of skill level as well it's not just like people who are hardcore to know it when I first came out it's some people would never touched it and some people we've written their own packages okay do you guys do

you guys do any heck meetings or is it mostly like presentation style or trying to switch it up a little bit we've done some workshops yeah we did the open source workshop you let that went really well I think it seems like our most popular ones so far has been the full stack talk and then some of our packages the package show-and-tell where people can come and kind of get a broader view

of the current state of nodejs okay yeah and you know Jean youyou've have a background working with Alton ads and Todd I don't know what your your background is but you know how does this community have you seen can you describe at all maybe the difference you've seen going to alternate meetings versus node meetings like is is there been a different vibe aside from maybe so

fresher and newer yeah a little bit a lot of ways they're sort of similar like it's it's a little bit more pragmatic and a little bit more thinking up front I think but I felt that all net was more like we don't have to do everything with the official microsoft bag choice whereas node is we don't have to do anything with anyone's back I'm just gonna make this tiny little package for

this thing that I need or just consumes other tango packages all that UNIX philosophy like do one thing and do it just small things yeah okay that's been really helpful for the community I think because you people do make these large frameworks like people have tried to replicate rails in nodejs yeah like that there's a big express that expresses a really thin layer okay but they've gone

like way beyond like really you could write code that looks like its rails code almost in CoffeeScript for example oh cool but I mean those things are going to pop up regardless but I think the overall community is really focused on like the smaller looks like i'm just going to write an express app which is analogous to Sinatra and Ruby right and then just

pull in the tiny pieces I need instead of starting with some over our children work do you typically meet just back to the meeting from it do you typically meet once a month like what's the ballpark where do you guys meet at we do once a month but at the rate of things changing sometimes it feels like we should be the more frantic but yeah we should we stick to once a month third

Tuesday every modern Tuesday of every man and I now there's they're also the Chicago JavaScript to have any cross-pollination with what they're doing I mean or is there enough crossover and the topics we haven't had any sort of official crossover homestead play something that we've been wanting to do but I guess I just forgot about it you see a lot of same faces yeah if you

realize though yeah there's definitely a attendee overlap okay yeah but it's different enough like node.js versus the client-side frameworks yeah also like one's more focused on front-end e ux implementation or traditional you see out of java script writer okay well thank you very much guys for taking the sound soccer thanks for have never

hi it's Mike here with you tastic I'm sitting down with Abdi Graham who runs the Ruby top oz and the Ruby rogues and the and the Sudanese wide teams blogs and podcasts he also does this very interesting thing where he held remote pair with people on open source projects and and also some paid projects after you thank you for taking the time to sit down I can you tell me a little bit

about how you got started doing these remote pairs and and how that's been working out for you well thanks for having me um so the repairing of just I don't know it I think it seemed like a natural progression honestly I had been working remotely for a long time that's that's just been sort of one of my long-term intentions was to work from home because I like being around my

family and and I like choosing where I live based on other other things you know besides being in a pretty no tech hub or something like that so I Mountain sort of suburban pennsylvania here and so I've been working remotely for a long time for various companies and um I am also a fan of pair programming because I've seen how effective it can be for spreading practices throughout a group

and you know and for keeping everyone on the same page and keeping keeping the bus the the bus number down and stuff like that so um you know I've been so you know the kind of net the natural thing was I've been pairing within companies that I've worked with or for remotely for a long time and um at at one point this summer I found myself with the the opportunity of taking

another traditional consulting gig but I had been really feeling the pressure uh the pressure on my time from the consulting gigs that I had I felt like I wasn't able to move forward on some projects that I wanted to get going like Ruby tapas and uh and I wanted something that would be more flexible something that you know it wouldn't be wouldn't be you know hours and hours and hours a day

and also where I didn't have to feel like um like getting a you know like getting getting the the product shipped was dependent on me working overtime and stuff like that I wanted to be able to to actually like you know have a good cut off with the work that I was doing for people and that can be hard sometimes even with consulting it can be

hard to sort of draw that you know draw those boundaries and so I I had I I had already been taking some sort of some ad hoc pair programming appointments and and not as an intentional thing but just some people had gotten in touch with me you know people that I knew from from from other things had just said hey can I could we set up a thing where I pay you and we just do remote pairing from

time to time you know usually somebody that wasn't typically people that work didn't have a good like they weren't in a company that had a lot of other Ruby programmers you know maybe they were the only program or maybe they were consulting like a soul consultant for something like that and they wanted to work with somebody else you know to to just both for the company and to hone

their skills and stuff like that and and so I've been doing that for a few people and I thought you know they seem to be getting a lot out of it and coming back and so what if i just did more of that instead of the traditional consulting and so I you know I took some time to cut like think about like what would that look like um you know and sort and write up some some copy about you know

the sort of things that I could I could consult on as a consulting para programmer and um and then I just kind of put my shingle out there and I've been you know basically flooded with with requests for appointments ever since okay and I mean do you mostly gets open source projects or do you get a lot of file of paid work through this as well i think i would say i think i get

more submissions for paid work than I i get for open open source work now I I do have to i run a backlog for the open source work just because I'm not able to do as many of those appointment I do those for free I do free pair programming if it's if it's on open source software and I'd love to be able to do more than I do but right now I can only do one a week

because it's um you know it doesn't pay the bills right um and I'm kind of curious uh you know Carrie Bernard I interviewed him over a cna and he's talked about how doing destroy all software he has people just sending him requests and and saying you know can you look at this code can analyze and they kind of an expectation that he can do all that do you get that with the pair

of program do you ever get people saying hey why don't you have time for for my project or hasn't been pretty like a congenial what did you have in your experience it's it's I it's been extremely genial I I uh anybody who follows me on Twitter well first of all knows that I tweet way too much but also knows uh that like somewhere between like you know like once a week or once a

month iight week the same line over and over again I get the nicest emails yes um and and it's because I do and I keep tweeting that because it keeps happening um you know I honestly the the Ruby community is fantastic and and I don't know what it is but but I get you know for the what i get is is just the nicest things that people people say and and i don't really i occasionally I've had

people I've had you know every I I get a lot of requests for can you give me some advice now I'd say more often it's more like career advice right then it is like can you fix this code okay um but you know I try to get back to everyone you know sometimes I'll say look um I i I'm sorry I tried to look at this but I just didn't have time to really dig into it um but for but I know I wouldn't say I

get a ton of people being like can you know please fix my code now okay yeah yes ever saw that was one thing I do wonder is like how much is a signal to noise do you get on these requests for you know word somebody remember I don't know if you ever looked at old code project or anything like that some of the older code sites or people would go in and basically post um or notice on

the Guru sites we can you do my homework for me kind of requests I just wondered if you got those kind of things that's uh um the the weird every now and then I get like some the most common the most common sort of like missing request that kind of misses the target is is I'll get a request that says for an open source pairing session that says I I want some tutoring you

know I like I want to pass this test and I'd like some tutoring and i have to say look the open source pairing sessions are really for putting code back into the community right so like if you have a project that you own or that you wanna cook you know commit to commit to not commit to but you know make some submissions to that's open source you know that's that's really what that's

for it's not really about me teaching yeah so it's not really code 101 it's more of you kind of have to have some least basic uh experience with programming be almost there it just may be a little bit of guidance or something that you need yeah I mean I do a lot of tutoring a lot of training and tutoring but that's pretty much under the the content in the context of paid sessions

okay uh because you know it's it's I mean it's tiring and it's it takes um it takes a lot out out of someone to you know to do that kind of that kind of work and I I kind of look to the open source sessions to be a bit more relaxing a bit more you know a bit more fun because hey it's you know it's working open source code romance that's awesome and so going over to some of the

more public stuff that should you that's the the Ruby rogues that's a pretty popular podcast I've seen Jim Gray is is trying to really get it elected to the to the best podcast of the year he's been tweeting about that a lot yeah it's always a pretty enjoyable interview and I matter of fact I listened to your most recent interview at least the first part of it were you guys have this kind of

banter and there was something about jokes that can't be made Jim Jim Gray I believe said something about we can't say these certain types of jokes and and then immediately somebody made a joke about back at jam about the wheelchair or something like that I was about standing desks and it was you know only friends can do that kind of thing yes and and that's really what

it sounds like on that podcast said you know how did you guys come to start that cast and well let me let me be clear here I i I'm a late comer to the honk at I'm the most recent addition to that to that group okay um and so as far as I know no so it's it's Chuck's podcast you know he he put it together initially and um I actually don't know the details of the early history I can't remember who

exactly was there at the beginning I know I'm pretty sure it was it was Chuck and and James and I'm not sure who else at the beginning I'd have to go back and look at some of the early episodes to see and I know that they you know they added some some folks along the way and then and for a while there um before I came on um Aaron Patterson was a regular okay and um you know which is awesome

but I I came on for an episode um and then they you know I I didn't I I guess I didn't insult them enough and and they had me back on for another episode and at some point um Aaron said decided that he just didn't have time to devote to that podcast every week and at that point they basically took Aaron slot which which is kind of a big seat to fill yeah this tender love so well then

I'd like to just jump straight over to the distributed team or the Y team excuse me so apparently you I should say not apparently but it really seems that you do have a passion for remote collaboration yeah and I have not yet listened to the white teams I saw it and it was kind of the day I that I decided I had to contact you to talk cuz i was i was working on you eat a steak and I was

not feeling good about something and I saw another Ruby tapas come out and then I'm like hmm Wow yeah he's got Ruby tapas and in Revere oaks and then there was something he tweeted something about why teams was like and then I went and looked at your biome like the sky is like a between the end of books I didn't even mention books um what have you learned through the wide

teams and what kind of was your inspiration for doing that the inspiration is just you know uh I work remotely and I probably always will because I want to live where I want to live with my family and and and I don't you know so you know my I a few years ago I thought to myself you know what is the best way to to you know yeah I felt like you know if if I'm going to make a

career out of working remotely with other software developers it behooves me to become good at it and I figured the best way to do that would be to talk to a lot of other people who are doing it and you know pick their brains and you know and i also just felt like you know when i was looking around back then I thought you know that didn't seem like there were a lot of good resources out

there for you know there were a lot of people doing it there are a lot of people doing different kinds of of remote work arrangements whether fully distributed or just like you know there's you know a main team and then there's some satellite people or whatever a lot of these things were going on but there weren't any resources where they were getting together and

talking to each other and so wyd teams has always been you know the dream for that has always been to build a community around the practice of dispersed teams remote work so if somebody was going to sit down and grab and listen to one episode is there any one particular interview that got a lot of wisdom from or um I think I would have to get back to you wow that's a

that's a really tough one to answer um you know I know a lot of people really enjoyed the Chad Fowler interview um but you know truth be told there have been so many good ones it's it's it's hard to narrow down here's the question that is it one of the things sitting down with user group people and people involvement of technical communities I've seen certain pattern

sort of emerged in the way different people approach to community the community have you seen that with the white teams I've been like I've talked to these 20 30 50 people and some patterns have emerged is that in something you foss i think a lot of people are are in fairly similar situations I mean you have a lot of startups that that you know they have

they have people in them that wanted to work together you know maybe they had all worked together at a previous company but then they went their separate ways and you know different parts of the country or the world you know but they still want to work together you've got some groups like that you have more established companies that are just realizing that they don't

have enough local talent to fill the slots you know that they want to you know to do the work they want to get done and so they're trying to hire people from wherever the talent is rather than then just in their local area um and you know and and various things in between there but I mean those are some of the trends that I see okay and and just kind of to come to an well

I actually have two more questions one is I'll just go with the equipment first I because I'm I'm curious as well and I'm sure other people who are going to be working remotely I'm curious for different reasons I'm just interested about the setup you used for recording and I'm sure use some of this for your remoting work as well what kind of a microphone and stand and set up do you

use for sure so for recording what I'm talking to right now is my my blue snowball which is the kind of the I think it's probably one of the most recommended you know podcast recording mics out there for if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg um you know it's it's USB which is wonderful because you don't have to worry about like like interference on the analog cables and so

that's that my stand is just some cheap stand that I had lying around in my in my attic um you know and I've got I've got a pop filter that I got along with them Mike and let's see what else as far as like remote pairing stuff um would you want to just know about like audio equipment or yeah I don't know just what are you used for communications do you do you have a

camera open regularly or to you I try to have video going and here's what I do I'm going to try to rotate this and hopefully this won't come tumbling down if you look over to my right over here well one thing you see is a mess but let's see if we can get this far enough over let's see just sort of see the corner there it is the corner of my tablet which is mounted on a amount

which holds it up in the air okay well to my right and what I try to do I try to use my tablet as my primary um comms device and it's you know so I've got skype and and and cheap Google+ and Google Talk on it and so i'll try to have the person that I'm working with on my like over here on the tablet and I can look over to them and there's their their face on video assuming we've got a

decent enough connection you know I spring for for business broadband but not everyone has has a good connection and and sometimes the Internet has bad days but but you know I have them over here and then I usually have the screen share that we're working on in front of me on my computer so it's a little bit more natural than like the the the like staring back at each other kind of setup

where you're both you know where you're using the camera on your work laptop right um thing and I kind of like that it also takes some of the the hardware load off of the pc that I'm working on yeah and you don't have to worry about reboot or anything like that right for um for that I've been lately i've been using a vxi blue parrot a be 250 xt plus which is a headset it's a bluetooth

headset that is mainly designed as i understand it for truckers it's got ridiculously long battery life it's got like 20 hours of talk time and a and it's got a fairly aggressive um noise control you know for first around like get not picking up on surrounding noises yeah that would that would be kind of necessary in a truck they're pretty loud yeah but you know it's nice

for me because like a lot of the Bluetooth headsets out there are there they're mainly they're oriented towards people making occasional calls they're not oriented toward somebody sitting for you know two four six eight hours at a time and working with somebody else and so that's why I got that that's been working out pretty well and kind of where I'm going to end the final

question is working from home working remotely you're disconnected a little bit from the banter that the chat in in a normal office you're more of a person who's on the edge of technology you don't really I should say you know Ruby and the tools you're using might not necessarily have to depend on user groups or anything like that for seeing her abreast of what's going on but do

you ever go to user groups or oh yeah yeah so my sort of you know home user group it I would say is the Baltimore be more on Rails group which I've been going there since their very first meeting I believe um and there's also a group up in Harrisburg and I try to I try to get get to both of those occasionally I certainly don't get every week get down there every month but

occasionally I try to get the to those I have a lot of friends at both and yeah I love users groups and I you know it's people like I said a lot of two people write to me asking about like career advice for a young programmer and that's usually one of the very first things that I stress is get yourself involved in local users group right now would appreciate if you put us in touch with

them because i would love to interview them as well the people who run those groups and um okay and the last but most important question is do you have a filter for your voice or is that your own natural barrett uh I don't have anything going on here I mean it's just the mic okay because obviously whatever it is and however much it is i'm going to buy

because I need everybody voice um I mean maybe maybe I have maybe this basement just happens to have good acoustics I don't know well okay well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me I really appreciate it sure thanks thank you ok there's the mark alright well yeah that's perfect

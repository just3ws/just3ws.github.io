hi it's Megan with dick tastic I'm sitting last night with my stringer one is the data side chicago room it's not about a year and you know bull thank you so much for taking the time to sit down what is status on chicago so we are a meetup group we started like you said about a year ago we use the trendy buzzword data science not big data yeah but someone respectable yeah yeah sounds

more acceptable but maybe it's a little bit more devious but so basically we try to bring together kind of the way that we frame it this kind of three groups of people so data people with kind of analytics backgrounds so maybe with a background statistics or hard science we also try to bring in people who have a design background so maybe user experience design or even kind of design

in a sense of an approach towards problem solving okay so so when you say design you all talking about front end human interface well actually in the broader sense maybe I like designer might take a particular approach towards designing some piece of hardware device or a medical device or it could even be an architectural design but it's not necessarily the traditions or more

common use of design where I'm making pretty yeah not making something pretty but but trying so the way that I like to think of it is that designers do a really good job at trying to like I a good problem to solve and that's actually one of the core reason is why we thought that and I say we because the idea for the data science group kind of threw out datascope analytics which is

no company but i'm one of the founders up in pocket so we saw this kind of need to bring the technical community together with maybe a less less technical community sometimes in our experience that technical folks that have a kind of data analytics background muffin start and say kind of hear some data what can be doing it whereas the design community they've basically kind

of perfected instead of asking questions like that they say what's important to do and then figure out how to how to do something valuable and solve that problem yeah so this ask the right questions that I have a lot of lumber I need to build something yes we'll problem whatever I need to go do I have homework exactly and we kind of if that's a great analogy because it's I

like to think of data is like an it's like a resource maybe not a natural resource but as a resource that you can use to solve problems but it's really important to figure out what needs to be done first and then how can do to be used as a resource to do that and so we want to cultivate with the group that way of thinking about this new resources just I mean it's like if you think of it

as lumber it's like data is doubling every three years or something ridiculous the amount of data bits story and so it's like this a resource that's just exploding in the amount so how we use that resources what they were Germans you found a group how to brave the idea of the data centers group come from so actually I went to couple of of meetups actually one of

them is hacks hackers here in Chicago okay I went to that thought was really cool idea when he explored the meetup page again I saw the hex peckers yes you know happening that at the time it was aaron paul green and she still organises it and Brian Boyer and so I went to that that was really cool explored the meetup site saw that there's a bunch of really cool and interesting kind of data

oriented groups like a big data group the Hadoop user group machine learning meet up and now there's data visualization also okay and the data science is kind of I would call it kind of like a it's a vague term nobody really knows what its definition is and it's meant to kind of encompass like solving the right problems visualizing it in a way that these these kind of our

analytical things can really be communicated and so we saw that is kind of a missing piece of the meetup community look and really our goals I mean it's a growing vibrant community of people that want to figure out valuable ways to use data and then to solve important problems for the city and there are all types of organizations have you ever worked with the opening

government group yet been absolutely dissolved there's a ton of cross membership between those always so I think these groups tend to have their own kind of sub community yeah is also an interesting I'll seeing them the idea i'm dealing with large datasets a million new tool sets of starting i set up there's an hour tutorial just you know all the languages for years Rooney

and jobs for never sending our which interface have you even seen not just people who were already in the industry of dealing with these big problems but you see a lot more people coming from outside then we were doing just you like so rails apps that now showing beginning yeah absolutely and with there are a few things that have kind of popularized

that approach to you know big one is nate silver in the recently evident 35 million 5 530 either listen yeah so I mean that the the fact that his predictions were right on right ended it was he was able to communicate that I think that's an actual key point that there's a lot of people who are making the same predictions actually but I need summer with its blocked and a fantastic

way of communicating that end and that really resonates with people and so it does bring it kind of a ruby community and people from all over the place that see like wow this is a really really powerful new way of communicating and it's kind of an objective view I said so he can just do good and it also made it accessible exactly that's something that's already looking into designers

and people can express exactly the sling that's in the view of like the kind of data science Chicago meet up view is it that's kind of a missing piece that the technical side there's there's a large community of people that kind of get that put it but we want to try to cultivate the sense of you have to have that in the communication and you have to

and solving a problem in my first place so it's kind of like those three key aspects to to really bring in speakers and Trump discussion about how we can all do that better that's kind of a golden well thank you very much for getting the time to sit down let me show you video

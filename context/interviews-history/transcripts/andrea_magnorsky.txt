hi it's Mike again with you tastic I'm on the line here with Andrea meg norske who helps run the game craft the Dublin Alton ads and she also does a podcast called 32-minute O's which is a minutos a very American here I'll mangle it but it's a spanish-language podcast hi Andrea thanks for taking the time to sit down hi Holly then and it's great to be here talking to you good good now you're

in you're in Dublin right now it we're in dublin ireland dublin ireland ok i'm in a via the united states so so we're a few hours separate it's the afternoon for you yeah yeah it's a very nice to 25 p.m. right now so let's just jump right in what what is game craft okay Kim craft is a game jam where you have to be there at the last one lasted 12 hours and what a game time is is that you

start today with nothing and you end the day with a game and you can work with a group or without a group and you know there's prices you meet new people to make games wit and that kind of stuff no like it's just like games for any platform or system Pacific yeah the idea is that you get good at prototyping our you get good at just actually make something it doesn't matter what it is

you know and use any platform you like the IDS you come from nothing to finish or you know to have a rough road type and that very sad time frame so like what kind of what kind of game should be we'll make well it was really funny we had one and like two weeks ago and we had the people you know we had html5 games well you know multiple multiple mm I most love games we had single-player

games we had my 88 games made in unity with really nice heart and we have games made with a love you know it's a game engine and from Lua it's a it's really interesting that it's really para it's from puzzle to like I'm a most to anything really oh cool and uh you said you had like prizes and things like this so you have like corporate sponsors or how does that

work yeah we created the the gaming industry in Ireland is growing big time and that also means there's companies then some self tanner unknown i cajoled team onwards work and you know we just reached out to them and said hey do you want to pay for some food and some practice and they were like yeah this is great because for them and they get to meet people who are interested in making

games and and for us is great because we means we can run a really nice event right yes so so this is this um you've done once or you've done it a few times and this is gone out twice and we have a slightly different one organized for the eleventh of December and that's one word with just companies like with just like little in the indie games companies that we're gonna do we're gonna spring cast

it life and we're gonna put a pic donate button and it's all gonna go to a local charity and the idea is I can you know game charming and hood with a kind of Christmas spirit and you know do something for Christmas that it's not like oh I'll just put a hot hahaha yeah so so what what made you start this or how did you get involved with game craft well I have a games company oh ok well

that would make sense yeah so something back there and and Matt that cat right yeah i'm one of the co-founders of bad cat games and we we make we make a pc console games maybe some or you know this man and and you know we kind of went like you know there's not enough this kinds of events so i just because i have experience running events I just went and talked to hey let's do a game

jam and got really popular and if the first one we had 250 sign ups and 150 people turning up on the latest a free event right and it was great the university was the university was the host so we had a full kind of ground floor full of people making games and was really exciting so you had people like sleep in and hair go in now it was just eight hours oh there's eight

hours okay so they were like particularly at the end everybody was yeah let them make their mainlining the red ball you know yes huh yeah what we had food into place so then what that was actually really good and you know people kind of commented and well you know actually made it thinking okay you know we'll just do this and then as soon and the same day people think what are

you doing this again so that was februari and we did one now in November so sure so now that you've done a couple of these now do you have any advice for somebody who's planning on doing a game hacking events sure and I I think the distinction I made on our game time is that you have to be there and there are some online ones that are great so if you're doing a presidential one I don't

know if that's the correct word like 11 you have to be there at the end make something so that people talk to each other about their games either I like that everybody has two minutes to present the games to everybody or that they have to go and talk to each other for some like some keep them a hook so they have to talk to someone else and then the other thing is actually having

food on the place so people don't have to leave and come back yeah 3 shuffle and water and you know the coffee and tea that kind of stuff it's actually coaching to run and and prices are a nice addition you know yeah make it comfortable inter offices are really good and for for running the events particularly open open plan offices so you know talk to your local people that

justice things and you know say hey can I use your office for a game jam yeah some would say yes yeah and and for the people that might want to participate in a game hacking event do you hear or any kind of packing endurance events do you have any advice for those people that are going to be participants yeah and always prepare what choose your framework before you go and it's super

handy to be ready and not having to spend an hour or so ago what I do downloading the framework or setting up if you're going to use repository set it up make sure you know don't count them wireless because there's gonna be no people maybe I won't like to start and that kind of stuff have a bunch of USB sticks just because you're gonna be

working with people you might not have network that might be a good way and bring a bottle of water okay yes I'll stay hydrated yeah okay and you're also involved with the Dublin aunt dot net and so what is what is going on with our all-time at Dublin well and at the moment I'm not running the organization of the group anymore okay because I founded it like a lot three years ago

and with someone else where we found that the other net it follows the principles of net I'm sure you guys know your audience basically just alternatives to microsoft.net the technologies and and we had a really really nice group and I thought it was time to leave the community drive itself okay cool well what what what drove you to start start the group well and I was

involved in Ruby Ireland at the start so and they I thought the wonderful work they were doing and I just craved it you know something that would cover my main language which is C sharp so then I met Claudia parola with Jill he's another guy that helpful he said let's found this it's like okay so how do we do this it's like well you should put a website look you're gonna meet in a pub and take

it from there yeah and you know the first day we have like 15 people and then you know we can having meetings and it kind of stays at that 20 30 levels of people Leo's very interested in learning more did you use meet up or were you just word of mouth or how did you communicate and we use google groups and twitter okay that you let people know about the meetings yeah yeah and you

know we you know the things like Ireland is relatively small there's a one and a half million people here so and developer community is not at so we all kind of know each other yeah so it's like hey you know there's like beer oh and we talked about go this great haha yeah veering code is always good yeah and I've recently handed off a group myself after a couple years and so

I'm interested in somebody else who's done something like it when you hand it off your group to another organizer or how did you do that how did you handle handing the group off with difficulty difficulty well would you say difficult you mean you didn't want to let it go because she enjoyed or no I I really wanted to let go so much work to do it right you know actually keep it going

particularly every month you know and the thing was finding someone that would look after the group with the same level of care and you know that you wouldn't disappoint the community by not being there and and I was lucky enough that the guys taking over me and we're working in my office so I was like I sent an email to everybody saying listen I need to leave and some needs to take

care of this because it's only fair and and I think you know maybe what I'm doing is getting and tired and boring because two years you probably just keep doing the same thing so I wanted new blood and new ideas and now two guys actually took it over and then one of them had to move to Switzerland so now it's just one guy all right he said I break up Andrew Smith that's great yeah

it's it's it's very satisfying when you see it handed off to me it was it seeing the people that took over it started to schedule meetings and see any this isn't dead this is that it sits right in and the last thing is is kind of interesting so you're in Dublin Ireland but you do a a spanish-language podcast yeah what you don't sound like you have a traditional Irish accent now come on

I learn in Argentina okay okay i came to 10 years ago okay so you do this this this podcast what what is 32 minutes 32 minutes and 332 you notice or 20 de minutos is a podcast about Todd net technologies to and I was interviewed on it a few times I just talking about like better practices secure s and whatnot and then you know somehow it kind of turned out it's like hey you know we had

to learn like two or three times can you do when I kind of host the show oh really and I was like yeah sure is haha because every time I was talking I I was struggling with the Spanish even though i'm a native speaker because i don't speak it often enough and I thought this is a great way to connect with a community that is latent and hungry for knowledge and hopefully I can help and

also get to practice my Spanish a bit more you know and make friends in Spain and thats all good things yeah so I had to wonder though if you did you did you learn technology in Spanish or did you learn technology in English because I have some friends and some colleagues who aren't native English speakers but the bias in programming is generally English and when they try to translate

stuff back into native language my wife is polish show sometimes when we're having a conversation she's helping translate for me words she doesn't have equal words for them was that something that was like a brother one of the things and in Argentina unlike in Spain were very Pro using the English words like you know your networking class is not cool Reyes it's called networking oh

so in cat5 is cut five and I disposable still i disposed of Allah you know so so but it this is not the same in Spain so the podcast is about sometimes incredibly funny and so no I and also I left Argentina about 10 over 10 years ago so I never thought with technology is like in that in spanish i thought one I like it's not a problem for me at all and

actually I find it weird in the podcast to when people say for example i'm used to say NBC and i may say so it's like what what is that doesn't even make sense for concern you yeah it's like whenever an acronym gets translated in like you know the USSR the SSSR that old it always struck me as funny like translating the Russian acronym into english in its always are just feels

variants like yeah that is ok well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me I really appreciate it thank you very much and I'm glad to hear people are doing stuff about user groups cool anything in its a let me know I'm round crisis and an Twitter in crisis on Twitter

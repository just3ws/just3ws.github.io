I'm like I'm sitting here with Zack who runs the boston soft craftsmanship group and welcome Zack can you tell us a little bit about the Boston software craftsmanship birthday sugar we have been around for about a year and a half and we do you were here before the last I see me right yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so the group I think we started April a year and a half ago whatever that is and

we do monthly meetings usually like the first Monday ok the month and the meanings we try and make them practice space or conduction base so like interactive ok so like like doing commas and pairing exercises and things like that yeah Eric exercises or discussions like will read a paper like you're this look like God's laws the way I'm drawn up like now the kakad scraper on a

relational design or porcelain I try to think we read a last month we read this unit paper okay I'm gonna trip back yeah and then other things we've read trying a blank right now but but what but you you kind of have home yeah sometimes we try and have a little bit of homework um so that people could have come ready to discuss something mm-hmm and that's definitely a better and said uh as I

just had to wonder if that whatever be you know it might be nice for me if I came to meeting and I know I'm going to be at the next meeting that I put in that time to read the paper so that we can be prepared for the meeting but if I come in and I Justin coming into my first ever meeting and I haven't read this paper i think is if you ever experienced anybody that's like what has

been a reaction to that if you had any people come in and participate and yeah yeah so I think sometimes we attract people depending on the paper we are reading so okay I know like the last meeting we had a guy who was lurking on the mailing list for a long time and he saw we were reading that s unit paper really interested in so they want to talk about other people um sometimes you

know another room is prepared I'm not always prepare yeah pretty lazy about grieving but it's okay because crazy yes I would you rate a min us you know it's it's just that no as long as there's enough people who can help a discussion ago okay okay and oh go ahead so depending on kind of what homework we had it'll like usually inform what activity we do ok so like one time I had

everyone just kind of peaked at think luau Oh no ha ooh I do it the scripting like the scripting language and then we all just kind of like played with the language bird I'm tonight so it wasn't like a formal I gave repairing at so much more tea let's see what we can do yeah so let's make this thing park yeah yeah we've had a couple things like that where we're just kind of like you know

messing around with something that no one knows or you know we do like there's a programming game that I invented and some of that looking you you invented a game what if what is that its rules the rules are we take some kada some simple exercises will be more complicated and everyone pairs up and you code for 15 minutes and then one person stays at the computer and another person leaves you

get a new pair and then then so you only pair on the code base twice oh you kind of like inherit a new code base okay so you're the words like the navigator and nurse apologies got to keyboard into working with them and then you get promoted to the driver's seat yeah the driver goes off and they will new yeah sec okay it's kind of silly but it's fun like sometimes you're pairing I'm like a

language neither of you know but it's okay because you're only on it for 15 minutes right so what also your kind of keeping people moving even through it and you're not just waiting for people to raise their hands of presuming you're like no you're next oh well everybody put it everyone's paired and then we took a timer so every 15 minutes oh we show everybody so it's not just one

station where we please watch oh no everyone all just everybody yes oh yeah like eight people we have it's musical chairs exactly then she will show you the court yeah there we go yeah new name musics done everybody get up change sheets some of them okay silly it's fun but um yeah and give me a previous conversation Boston is like watching universities if you've got any

students coming into meetings no no that's its do you think it's just maybe they are not aware one more or is it I think um cuz that's me a unique environment when I try Suncorp very corporate surrounding I don't know I don't do the best job of publicizing oh that is that one you know it's great it's great you know it's hard it's hard it's hard up all the size and running a

user group it's hard it's a lot of work and so that's one of the challenges I think of running it user group is doing the publicity yeah and fence I big you so like right now we have you know no I don't know 62 people who come in meeting it's a regular crew but I think I think you made the point about the how big you wanted to get okay the user who isn't always watches trying to build the

largest base of attendance it's can I build a group that I can meet with on a regular basis I enjoy interacting and learning it doesn't always have to be 550 people by 80 people are of ten people it's are we having fun to be this long period of time and I'm learning things yeah I think it's an interesting perspective on yeah and for me that's what the saucer craftsmanship group is

around is kind of my education and you know my other peers education until you so you don't want to make sure that yes I don't learn best passively I don't think most of us do so it's important to me that whatever activities we do our kind of interactive right you know a discussion internet well thank you very much for Randolph II great appreciate it drinking

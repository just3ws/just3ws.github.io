hi it's mike with you Pete astok again I'm sitting here at a side tank mean on the site a site as a Chicago information technology architects scrutiny and I'm sitting here at MW Murphy who twr fee on Twitter who run see I user group item thanks for staying out of me thank you can you tell me a little bit about what is psychic well a chicago information technology architect group the whole

long name that we're officially required to have there because architect is a protected name professionally we have to call information technology otherwise we could sue oh well we started 2008 four of us that wanted to get together and discuss our protection related topics but we didn't want to limit it to one particular practice within architecture

we essentially sit down with Microsoft people job of people Ruby you name it we good as well ask is it is that focus on panel we're very agnostic as far as what platforms we cover I'm granted the group that started the the architects group was all Microsoft people an architect evangelist from Microsoft Larry clarkton Carl Franklin from maven wave and gentlemen from CDW Stephen

Rylander Carl and I are the only two that are left from the group at this point and yeah between shuffling our normal consulting jobs and trying to get speakers and so that we can offer the Chicago community of view into different technology topics that affect the way we architect solutions okay so your talks are more like kind of higher level this side put together solutions that's how

much implementation details we vary some of them are very high local concept in other ones we've had a couple one that we did last year was Java versus C sharp and design patterns okay so we went down into the code and no you know more of a application architect level and then we've had ones at the data architect or information architecture of them I've been to one of

your meetings before but what was our differently what was the ah it was the CAG the CAG a chicago architecture now when you kind of mentioned half and a change name was that why i got a week since we've only had architect as are the name we got some warriors cease and desist letter is o to sit down with the lawyers for the architectural profession within illinois yeah and they allowed us

to change the name to chicago information technology that's good so they were I mean was it just like a cease and desist or were they like we're going to sue you that it was you stop calling yourself architects or parking so at least it was which is really it's strange that they would restrict it but I guess there's Union

concerns or something or its architects physical architects are trained certified people whereas that's not something that's probably done then the IT we don't have just one mole the ice ax the international association of software architect is been trying to do that and that was one of our original options before praise group is doing

become a nice attractive okay but there were a number of legal things that who would have had to take him on as an official entity and board of directors and everything else that we were more interested in supporting the community right away trying to set up all that infrastructure yeah that's cost money and it's time well yeah and we we need a whole

business plan so we just opted to go more of a free-form a forum type of them now what kind of AA meetings you have to anymore presentation style or do you have back to work now they're all presentation style kind of open forum question and answer they're usually about 45 minutes long and you know as far as the presentation

itself goes we'll go maybe to about an hour a half won some questions or fabric well thank you very much for they're going to come she ate

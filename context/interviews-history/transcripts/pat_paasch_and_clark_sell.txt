hi I'm Mike I'm sitting down with Clark and Pat this is Pat this is Clark from ankle bracket in the market is a user group up here in northwest suburbs and actually just came back from a meeting so that part can you tell me a little bit come on it's a hanger bracket which was that is very guys that was my commend gals I guess laundry on hannity coat speak up yes not loud enough yes

any opportunity we're in a bar we do after angle bracket so so what is angle market but why don't we just do two more so we've tried to warn him Berg web developers like yourselves to come and meet once a month take a topic and just coat yeah somewhat on structured / structure language on target kind of kick it off by talking about it I've been up to air could you start a goatee

and it kind of revisited back via Ryan some people switch around yeah my kind of awesome this is coming to hands on yeah I and unlike most desk interviews I pictured participating in these weekly and I took criminal things I liked was it is we have a topic and then it was kind of like some people work i'm done that stuff something to look back Jasmine you

know some people why was we got pusher with Ruby so you know it was it's all front end with no no balance around other than you know so how long have you been doing this is so second or third about three hours yeah yeah so this was the first meeting was the Virgin pumpkin and so what did you guys fun and I know you've been in luck it felt quite a bit with usually in Chicago still are

different adventures so you know obviously you were able to bring a lot of what your experience going to show me boobs what planet yeah why devs why did you decide at this time away from the user group I'm scared yeah I mean something different yeah I think we said any kind of this life from Lori we all sit at home and code we all learned and that's usually by our song

yeah I went along with a lot of times I think getting experiences for different people how they perceive something are you something different question the only further enhancing I'm getting hands-on friend yeah that's what tonight was about and I'm hopefully as time goes on in a source repository we're all working in pulling back into we can grow a set masses of that you know when you

walk away when I'm spitting oh well we were doing this web second thing i forgot right I haven't been using it for a month or two so it's been a long wait but I know I can go to angle bracket I get up and I can just go grab that and I should be able to refresh that and oh by the way packed in this thing is web sockets all in Laguna and work through this thing we do look across welcome

so kind of it's kind of the point so kind of you want to build up a body of knowledge users group see more to help the pain not just learning together but also good selfie the people can go back and use the effort ok one of the ESN eventually did wanna be selfish but the point is it can be selfish what you want to learn using so you want to learn something because you ain't that for the

meeting and say I want to learn this for you or and when we've been running that if you want to get out tonight this is your two should go away with something that you're not happy and find something that is somewhere interesting and you know in like even with the pusher for me it's something I'm working outside project and if there's an old priority normally when I sit down and be like

what do I have to do on this punch you know when to slow down for this two hours that I WebSockets isn't clean let's dig up from way back in the backlog bring it up is not an excuse right to you like to do that so that was that's not fun so on and so on my never experienced with pusher next time we go there yattaman that grants that experience of something else right like

a deputy why you want to spend on metal ball yeah I'm gonna think of that yeah they're also longer ya mean we did we are guys with mature jasmine no single are gone that route I tried to get no expected running mailing this is a little bit of 15 people made something for him that's a pretty broad breadth of technology yeah just yeah I was impressed level level

hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here go to come 2014 I'm saying you were just humble who today presented on dev ops and he's got a background as the co-author the continuous delivery book and those was working on another book that will get it to in a minute but also in and also and also you're a busy person uh he's working on a new conference called flow con but first you

know thank you for taking the time to speak with me and strove for having me ah your talk today was on DevOps can tell us a little bit more about what what part of DevOps mean what you what does DevOps as one of those terms it means a lot of things to different people you will help to write the book on and continues to livery which helped lead into you kind of what we call dev

up so you can you tell us a little bit about what that means to you and how that relates to your talk today yes I mean which is a very big question yeah and debate rages on how to define the hopes and what DevOps really is but for me ultimately DevOps is about creating a culture in which we're always learning how to get better creating and evolving and operating great products and

services with a particular focus on collaboration between all the different people involved in doing that whether that's the engineers young people the operations people and all the various groups are involved in doing that so it is it just about deployment it's about the whole application cycle from from code writing to delivery yeah and you know even outside that cycle I mean even

well the point of continuous delivery is to give you this capability to be able to get changes out fast into users in a low-risk way to make it economic to work in small batches but once you have that capability the question then becomes what do you do with it and there you know that I think you know the people in the devops field will tell you that you use that for creating a feedback loop so

that you can make sure that your work on the right things so you're building things that actually delight users and improve the customer experience and so it kind of feeds into that whole discussion around making building things that delightful and better so please and is that what your goal of your talk was the right actually what was the title of the talk so

tightly was a long one it was very long titles I do sorry about that so yeah devops culture and practices to create flow devops culture and practice is decreed flow and flow being flow being being able to get ideas out to users as quickly as possible so i mean the the question of the thing that is actually doing the flowing was kind of the premise for the talk right because i go

back to the choice of reduction system and the idea of flow in the context of the Toyota Production system is you know the customer puts in an order I want this car how fast can you get it to right so this kind of idealized concept of one-piece flow of being able to go from customer order all the way through to delivering the vehicle as a single piece of flow with no kind of

interruptions and queues or anything like that which you know is unachievable but your ideas that you always moving towards that so the idea is what secret of that in the context of sort of development so my contention is that what you what you should be looking at is check-ins creating builds and trying to get those bills out of users as fast and as safely as possible and how do you

actually do that okay in in it and some people that is even at the very beginning of how to write software is a controversial topic right now of the TDD rhino CDD dad like we can't even agree on how to write software modules how to finally get something too to that end user is that something you've been experienced or having conversations about my trying to figure out those kind

of things with your teams and yeah absolutely i mean one of the things that again i said in the talk and i also say in the book and to anyone who'll listen to me frankly is that you've got to build quality into the product so the idea that you can somehow write some code and then there's like quality activity a bit further down where you my name is any good that doesn't work or

you have like a set of quality team is the responsibility of the people building the software to build quality in one of the ways that you do that is through TDD by making sure the developers are responsible for writing the tests that show that there software does what users want and what they expect of it I mean TDD is the whole other topic in its own right and

you know one of the things for me about tid is you know going back to the idea of satisfying the user what we do in TDD is we put ourselves it forces us to put ourselves in the perspective of the user of the software right the first thing you do any write a test is you know for when you're starting TDD for a new module or component or class or function you think about what's the API because

you have to write the test against an API that doesn't exist yet right so you're designing the API which puts you in the perspective of the user yeah and that for me is a really important point of GV air forces developers to think as a consumer of the software they are about to build design an API that's simple to use and simple to test you get that pain really they're like well what

what comes here right and actually once you've worked out the right test to write actually writing the code that implements that should be relatively easy the hard bit is working out what the test should look like and and and so that I think actually is very you know there's a very lean aspect of that and just you know jumping straight over into alluded to a book that you're working on

is this also in the same vein of tar paper roses what is the book so the book is called lean enterprise and the book is about how large companies can innovate at scale okay and so excuse me pardon me the problem we had with the continuous delivery book is we talked about technical practices and the principles behind them but organizations have trouble implementing it and we see

it time and time again people say oh we'd love to do this where we can't because of oh excuse me again we can't because of our architecture or because of governance or because the compliance or because of our budgeting process and so the book tries to address the whole ecosystem of innovation how do you build and grow a company that can innovate at scale you know big companies who don't

treat I t is a competitive advantage find it very hard I mean I t ends up being the critical path right because there's no investment in it its treated as and you know in order to hammer yeah it cost Center an order taking function and then you know it takes ages to get nothing done it has to follow all these rules imagine if your software actually was a competitive

artist your business right how would you do things differently and of course there are companies who do do that you know Netflix and Google and all these other kind of companies that are doing this stuff at scale actually treat software as part of the product development process and is central to how they innovate and its kind of exploring how enterprises can adopt back

culture and I can see how some of this all of these things can be daunting for somebody who's adopting them because even even these terms lean flow now I'm doing the other one but they have multiple meanings in different contexts like it when you described flow my first earlier and you describe flow I'm thinking about the lokra flock and then you're talking about product flow and

its is it been something that's been a challenge making sure that people understand these terms that have been used in different contexts that they understand the context of what you're talking about yeah I mean it's a huge problem even understanding the concepts and understanding the names and then on something how they fit together and you know people make basic mistakes with

this stuff and then you know again it's not because they're stupid it's because it's genuinely difficult here counterintuitive a lot of people think the lien is about cutting costs lien is not about cutting costs lien is about reducing waste and by reducing waste we end up with lower costs but you don't just go out looking for expensive things and cut them out of the budget right

right but people do that people like world we're going to go lean that means you're going to reduce our head count yeah and we'll actually no that's not the case and again if you look at Toyota I mean in japanese culture until quite recently everybody had a job for life so you could never fire anyone so the idea with lean was that you would increase productivity by you know making people

more efficient of what they did more effective what they did and that frees up people to work on high-value things instead and what they would do is they would use the efficiency games they've got through applying new principles to drive the growth of the company because those people who are doing all this low level stuff and our freedoms do higher level

stuff and now we can do more stuff and so that means we can expand our market or introduce new products you know it gives you the power to do all these additional things whereas a lot of people adopting leave they think it's about you know making people redundant of firing them so we can release costs right no absolutely oh that's totally not the point but you know this is just

one of many misconceptions yeah and it's very counterintuitive in its in its even this is a word that is comp and a lot of interviews is empathy I mean trying to put your mind into the listeners mind and that's that's always a tricky I'm here or doing these interviews it's trying to to take what are my own biases like when I hear lean i'm a developer so I'm thinking I'm not flow I'm thinking

developer flow so when you're in your at these presentations do you often get people that are or when you're talking these topics too often get people surprised or pushback expecting something different in and have to be brought back into the fold or yeah stands all the time I mean because you know people come up and they know they expect yours as we can see this livery

guy we need to be songs very technical things and I found that the technical stuff is not the problem the problem is leadership and culture and so I tend to talk about those things these days and you know being a bunch of research in my book so what comes on my talks is basically a lot of the research I've been doing in the book and talking about that stuff and that's not what people

often expect to talk about but in my experience is the most important stuff so yeah I mean I kind of hope that people will come and be excited by some of this stuff and be inspired I mean the most I can hope is that people come away with a bunch of ideas for things they can try and that's what i really hope but you know people are not necessarily going to get what they come for and yeah

so uh one of the things i want to do is say sorry to the people that you know when they were expecting out he talks maybe they got something leaking you too and what do they say you didn't get what you ask for about you you need it right um maybe hopefully I am well and then just a sec west reading to your conference you're working on flop and fried is obviously something

thats related to this topic yep ah but what is it where is it okay so this year it's a the week of Labor Day third of September in September in San Francisco you go to flow cotton ball low calm down flow con org okay and my fabulous British accent but the W yes i'll go w cmin door and the idea of the conference is to explore the whole range of stuff that goes into building great products

and services so we talked about UX we talked about product development we talked about you know deep dive on technical topics talk about culture talk about all those things and the idea is to emphasize the fact either it's a cross functional activity so you know we don't have a developer track in the you extra and uh abstract because that kind of goes against the whole principle

which is though you'll have to work together and we explore all the different aspects that go into creating great products yeah the developers need to know more about the business business or the needs and apathy had more obscene with what business needs and the business needs to understand what they're asking so everybody needs a kind of kid apathy yeah it's like I know and

that's absolutely right mean my personal experience I wanted to design a conference that reflects our industry as I wanted to not as it looks right now and I also kind of wanted to think about you know what makes you a great conference when I go to comments I often will attend topics that I don't have very much about so that I can just get my mind blown I really enjoy that

experience so I kind of wanted to go to a conference where you could see a bunch of things that were related to what you do but not directly related so tangentially related and get an idea of how will this stuff fits together create bigger picture because again one of the things about lean is you know you can't just optimize your particular part you've got to think about the whole and

think about the high level objectives what you're doing so you know it's important to think about all these other things and how they fit together and as you say great empathy for all those different people and what they're trying to do so the conference is focused on that and on real stories of people doing real things in difficult situations September a third yeah in San Francisco

San Francisco flow cone at work yeah and if you register before May the 30th doesn't holy boat so you get it cheap great well thank you very much for taking the time to speak to be pleasure thanks so much I've index user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for

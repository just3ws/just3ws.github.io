hi it's mike with you classic i'm here at railsconf 2014 and i'm standing here with liz amin aunty who is a co-leader for the girl develop it Chicago thank you for taking the time to speak with me solutely what is girl develop it you said this is a nationwide or an international organization we have about 25 chapters including one in Sydney Australia which is super awesome our

main goal is to teach women of diverse backgrounds have a great software and how to transition into technical careers in a safe space warm welcoming inviting question friendly space and how did you go about bringing a check or Chicago did you found it with somebody else or how did you work that out we're actually celebrating our one-year anniversary and 12 thousand members it's really quite

impressed I am actually a new co-leader I took over in January from the previous chapter co-leaders Jen Myers in Brittany turban who founded the chicago chapter last year so myself and my current co-leader Katie kind of picked up where they left off and doing classes events meetups career workshops all sorts of stuff so what what kind of how do you go about letting people know that he

obviously adhere the conference and sharing for what are some of the ways of people that maybe participate or one more about your organization oh absolutely where a girl develop it calm Twitter we are GDI Chicago there's also girl development on Twitter which is our national office we have all of our medics on meetup com most of them are free classes are paid

we do strive to make classes affordable so they're significantly cheaper than a community college class or an online class but obviously they're not free like coatesville and things like that we are an in-person alternative to that some people just really thrive in classroom with instructors we've got ta is to help people one-on-one ok so it's mostly twitter meetup we've got to

Facebook page and it's a lot my word of mouth most of our instructors are women in software engineering or design who come into classes and they share them with their co-workers and their co-workers say hey I can learn to do your do that for Elsa that's a lot of word of mouth ok so if something wants to go they could just search for a girl develop in Chicago what if there is

somebody watching who's in a different city that maybe doesn't already have some kind of organization where's may be interested in learning more about starting their own dingo girl develop it calm and shoot an email to headquarters there's a later on there to contact headquarters we're always looking for new chapter leaders we launched a few new chapters and

reporter I know we've got an arbor coming up this quarter which is really exciting for us because we've had to trade for a while but not Ann Arbor and we're always looking for more people and are there any events in particular that we're coming up in the next few months yes we actually have a few we're doing a summer series of jumps trip classes to kind of take you from very beginner

basic level to advanced I can actually make a backbone application level we would testing and all this kind of awesome stuff most classes run throughout the summer and our fee-based they range from I believe thirty two hundred dollars per boss and we also have free meetups twice a month that are kind of just come from your computer for your project hang out let's be friends

we do one that usually the second Thursday and the last Tuesday and if I'm a male running a user group and I'm looking at my community passes to Carlene bunky yesterday OMG antik advantage yes conflating but I asked for as well yesterday what are some things that eyes user group organizer who might be male in an all-male rubery might want to think about or be aware of

unfortunately my community and try to reach out to females who might want to come sorry it is all yantra middle-aged white guy from each other it's always really important to have codes of conduct in place and volunteers and staff were aware those codes of conduct so that if something does happen they have a safe place to go to where they can get the issue addressed and they can

be listened to and cared for in a productive positive way it's also really great to have someone come in give a talk to your group maybe about diversity or maybe about different opportunities for volunteering sometimes just putting the bug in people's here that this is intimidating for people to come to this group is a new person goes a really long way I know my first day of high school

was absolutely terrifying and that's the analogy that I make my first day of high school as a freshman at a school with over 5,000 people teeny tiny little white girl at a majority ethnic high school I was terrified because it was completely different I had just moved from a very small farm town and that's what it's like for me to go to the faculty exactly yeah so to kind of

relate it to something that they may have experienced themselves really helps and it's always great to reach out to local groups like wrote about the Chicago or other organizations like women who code and invite them to come to your group or perhaps have some of your members volunteered ta or help find venues for classic yeah that was to my next question like with the rails bridge

Oh outreach workshops males can go in and helpful in teaching everything it's inclusive is that that is this also the same thing yes we are women focused but we're not women exclusive we do have wonderful wonderful male instructors and absolutely amazing ltas we also have male students my husband actually took a girl oppa class before I became

co-leader it was really great yes total scope so does go yeah and learning in an environment where you can feel comfortable to ask why isn't this working because you wrote it in all caps and said lower cave it's the tiny questions a student is my first day is developer what is TBD everybody's saying this i have woods jump and okay okay but it's one of those silly things you feel

safe in our spaces and so we keep these spaces through merrily for women but we are absolutely welcoming of other people I do very very carefully screen all of our instructors or speakers or TAS and I make sure to select people that I think are good fit and its its its race creed LGBTQ everybody we love everybody thank you very much for these hoes because we appreciate it thank you so much user

groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm you

hi it's Mike again with you tastic I'm here still at the go to come for Chicago 2013 right now I'm sitting down with Mike Lee who's created the extra hand movement I he was a keynote and at the end of the day he knows speaker yesterday talking about mobile development but also you have this thing that you called me apster BAM movements well first thank you for sitting down

with me and what is the app stirred a movement well you know after damn is an organization that started two years ago in Hamsterdam okayed it was really about this idea of one of these tech conferences you can basically these really community-focused one so i go to write and being really inspired by the way that when we're with each other when we're together with you know other

people who are into the same stuff that I ring to it makes us somehow smarter you know it's we share ideas freely we can easily bounce things around I mean every time I come to a conference I just feel like my brain has just really really gone somewhere you know it's a fantastic feeling and I thought we should have that feeling all the time and so we tried to come up with ways to

try to make it like there was a technology conference in the city of Amsterdam all the time it very quickly ended up spreading to other cities and other countries even all the way here to Chicago right right yeah one of the people who haven't drawn a blank on that I pumped into yesterday missing we have absurd am here in Chicago so is it is it a user group or is it something else

it's kind of in between okay cuz the thing about apster damn versus pretty much any other like technological organization is that it's open to everybody right so it's not a particular platform it's not a particular technology we like apps and if my caps we want to talk to you and not just the technologists who like apps the designers who work on apps but also in

employers market tears other people who are interested in apps or even imagine if you were say a publisher and you don't know anything about apps you don't really want to know anything about that except that apps are destroying your business so you need to know about apps and where do you go to talk to people about apps that's what Amsterdam is it is in the spirit of Amsterdam a middle

ground where everyone is welcome to come together in the spirit of creativity and commerce so when you say apps you are specifically talking about mobile iOS Android really we don't care bring your own definition if it means mobile if it means Android to you that's fine right if you are more concerned with like web stuff like we are not in the business of luring the definition of a nap really

we're just a friendly bunch of technologists and lots of people who like to handle technology but while the virtus it sounds like it's it's people who like to deliver product you know it's not I like to obsess over this algorithm it's we want to deliver things we want to make things that people get into their hands whether it's on an ipad and phone or it's on the computer via

web site or whatever it's it's about delivery it's what it sounds like to me well it really is but at the same time there are so many different aspects to what we do to the making of a nap you know like we're trying to hire somebody you want to look for things like is this person that a musician right you know does this person have adventures this has nothing to do with making apps per

se right and yet it does there's this kind of Gestalt about all this kind of thing so yes we are people who like to deliver apps but if you want to talk about some crazy algorithm they'll probably find somebody who wants to talk with you about so do you have monthly meetings or are these five monthly how how does your struck how do you structure in and is

there like a overarching like this is how you do apster dam in X yeah they're kind of it you know there's there's kind of the Amsterdam formula and so if you look at the way extended in Amsterdam it's not necessarily the way that it's done everywhere else because when an embassy opens up like in Chicago for example they might decide you know we don't want to meet a seven o'clock on a

Wednesday right and the point is not to me the seven o'clock on wednesday the point is that you should have a regular made up that happens in a regular time at a regular place so that it's not moving everywhere so that it's easy to find right but that's just one of the things that we do in amsterdam we have some kind of event or meet up and get together on average every other day oh

so this is way beyond the monthly it is really about there being a tech conference all the time if you come to amsterdam for a week there's going to be at least one lecture for you there's going to be at least one you know get together and drink event for you there's there's very likely to be some kind of a workshop or a casual weekend get together to play games or go to a museum

or you know get your families to know each other we do all kinds of crazy stuff so this is this sounds like it's really about you really focus on building their community very much yeah not not let's get together and have our little social club but this is it so it's far gramma social quote for example the reason why I know that we have an event on average every other day is

because the University of Amsterdam has a research project to measure after Dan and its effect on the city oh really yeah so what have they found i will for example if you were to look at the they have some some some criteria of like you know after damn related business okay and then they looked at the Chamber of Commerce and they look at business registrations and you can see a like a

fifty percent increase in the number of technical businesses opening up since the advent of apps 2day where they did a comparison of the top geology related meetups in the city of Amsterdam for example and found that if you if you stack all those bars up in terms of like number of events Amsterdam has more events than basically everyone else in the city combined well this is a

kind of a surprise here on the camera for me because this is the first time I've heard of of any kind of quantifiable research into what technical communities what the impact of them is is there is it is there any links to this software dev stream site or where could one go find out more about that so the the name of the the project itself at the University of

afternoon was called inov is that I and OH iei and we probably have some winter or something on a napster damned RS which is our home okay yeah that's that's the that boggles my mind that there's been this community here in Chicago and uh and I'm not heard of it but it sounds like it's a really vibrant community very much in that also I think kind of reveals just how big technical

community can be this that there could be stuff going on right underneath your nose and it's it takes effort to go out in and dig into it and find these things that that's even you know as small as you might think our communities are they are spread out over a large area in you don't maybe communicate as well as we're not going to communicate it or not when I really do people people yeah but we

work on this as well an afternet for example we have a lot of different speaker training programs you know I used to work at Apple and so we had this conference called depth FTC right and every year the engineers would have to be trained on how to speak so they can get up on stage and give their presentations also there's this sort of weekly series that happens every

Wednesday equal to spotlight on and people get up and they talk about what they're working on and then they did speaker training so we took that idea with us with after them so that we have the weekly Wednesday lunchtime lecture is where somebody gets up and pull the blog we have speaker training and then we have another speaker training program which is kind of like a

toastmaster sing that meets once a month and then we have another speaker training program cook pitch Club which is actually a speaker training program based on Fight Club okay now I've heard of pitch pitch groups where you get together and you learn how to fishing and critiqued on what your delivery on how tertiae were and how to racked and things like that is that kind of like

what that is or is it something a little bit but first of all you get the feedback from me and well I've been known to be a bit direct ok that's the fight comp there's a difference since hence the fight but yeah right but really it is it's a 60 second pitch and then you you get feedback basically on you know first of all how do you overcome the natural wall that someone

puts in front of them when a stranger turns around it starts talking about something how do you communicate effectively especially this is Europe we're talking about so a lot of people are not speaking English as their first or even second language right and so you know for example ego strong accent that's going to affect the way that you're able to communicate a lot of

people aren't going to want to talk to you about your accent but that's the reality of what you're going to have to deal with all right and not only that but once you have my attention what are you going to do with you have 60 seconds are you grabbing my attention at the end of 60 seconds are you converting me to your son that's kind of the full pitching cycle and in the fight club

fashion it is your first time you have to pitch okay sir everybody that comes test bitch okay so there's no lurkers no lurkers around okay and if somebody is in a city that doesn't Hamsterdam events where do they go to learn more about this I mean Jimmy there's there's website and all that but see here who can they get in contact with to learn more about how to start

something in their community sure I think if you want to start something in your community then you should probably write two from the info and after damned at Rs okay it would probably be the right email address for that sort of thing okay well thank you very much for taking a turn of my budget it's fascinating find out that there's this under I don't want say under guard

community but this community that's been underneath my nose I'm going to be digging into here in Chicago fantastic thanks you

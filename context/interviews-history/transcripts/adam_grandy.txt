hi i'm mike with you casting i'm sitting here at Windy City rails with Adam grandi who does the I did say that right thank you Adam grandi who does the audio video at Windy City rails and you've been doing it for a couple years and cute you just see a little bit about like how long have you been doing the video and how has how is making sure that you know you could quality video

over the last few years I mean it had been something that's changed a lot since javis coming back yeah I've been with Chicago Ruby and windy city rails for about three years since 2009 and it has been evolution something that I've been excited about I'm real passionate about live production since it's a great opportunity to get involved we've evolved the quality of the production

throughout the years and a lot of that just comes from things that we've learned year-over-year from conference to conference certainly the more you do something the better you get at it if you're kind of looking for ways to improve upon it and that's that's really the philosophy that we have here from for me and from the organizer ray again kind of the thing that we espouse and

what we'd like to do now if somebody is looking to do like recording of their own user group you know I've had a great success with just having a macbook em and a photo booth but somebody wants to do do you have any suggestions for like a simple way to get nicer good clean audio or sure yeah it I do a couple things number one it's going to depend on the the mic that you use your miking

technique and then you know you're recording and whatnot so for Chicago Ruby and windy city rails we're using a countryman e6 okay about a $300 microphone it's it's widely used in live production concerts churches all kinds of things because it's a great price point delivers fantastic audio and kind of getting back to some of the things that influence the quality of the audio

you're my keen is important so you know for speaking your options are either a stationary microphone a handheld microphone yeah exactly a lavalier microphone or what I'll call an ear microphone so the countryman is an ear microphone which means its proximity miking so the mic element is just right by the mouth by the mouth and whatnot so with the e6 you start off with a

phenomenal sound and then once you kind of send that sound to the recording again every you know comfort crisp and clear yeah you know it well you'd asked earlier about kind of what influences that that audio will we use you know wireless channel so we're using sure equipment and whatnot so that's for our signal flows it's pretty good that's that's how we gonna laugh okay and I

have been anything that's been like a real big surprise would like that you might think you'd be a comment was there something maybe he had a common assumption about all we're gonna we have to have this kind of audio for that you've learned didn't work quite the way you thought it would yeah you know assumptions are common and they can actually you think one thing and another

thing happens I think especially when you talk live production a lot of things can happen and that's where doing things regularly and kind of knowing what you're doing really helps I don't know that I could put my finger on any real one assumption that's been hard for us I think is it as it relates to user groups what we found is you know if you're recording the user group audio or video

with the intent of distributing it for people to view or listen to usually you know for user groups you're working with volunteers or what not like that so what we try and do is we try and do our production as close to the actual user group as possible so when we record a video we want to edit it and upload it that day yes because that decreases the time when when people become less

motivated and like oh well we'll just do it next time we meet and things like that so so an assumption for us has been you know the quicker we can get to distribution the better it's going to be for everyone yeah it's it's this small of the Frog nothing its depth it's gonna it's going to be time consuming it's going to be a little painful but and especially if you get a rhythm down to

it right that's that's probably the biggest thing is that it's a very machine it's physically mechanical yes I'm trying to see ah now the other thing is is that you you you're not a developer but you watch these conferences you've been doing it for years and you watch all the speakers get up and they have their the talks what what kind of evolution have you seen is

it like they just are kind of the same thing every year or if you notice that oh the style of presentation is drifting or something that then maybe those of us in the audience were there as developers are just listening to content maybe not listening to you can how it's it's framed yeah you know I don't know programmatically if you know presenters are presenting differently than they

have three years ago I would say there's a couple of changes year over year for us then the most basic is the conference is grown so there's no more people which is mean means that we now can have more presenters that also means that we can also have different types of presenters so you're right I'm not a developer I don't really get too much into the day-to-day you know coding and what not

i but i would say beyond kind of very technical things like you know our spec and whatnot we're also getting into kind of more of the management tasks how do you work with you know your staff of developers what are the you know ways to improve upon that working as a team and whatnot so there's programmatically there's been some some new talks that if really i think then food for developers

and managers that can really improve their practice beyond their technical skills now I and just one last question is dealing with Pacers okay is that ever been something if there's a few people that are well known in the community that like to move that stage sure that's something that's been you know a challenge when I asked it because some

way I felt bad for ya photographer camera operator yeah it's not I don't think it's too much of a challenge for me I've my background is in live video production so I've got a lot of experience with camera work and whatnot I'm sure that it can be a challenge for someone who's maybe new or doesn't do that regularly you know it just comes down to making sure you've got the right

gear a fluid head tripod helps you out making sure that you kind of understand your framing your composition when a person's walking across the stage and you're shooting them live with the camera making sure you give them lead room and whatnot and then it just comes down to practice you know having done it before you know having maybe been coached by someone those are

opportunities that will kind of improve your skill do you ever talk with this the speakers and say oh hey this is kind of this is please kind of stay within this yeah yeah so we can get a nice clean I have I don't do that too much anymore just because you know typically they aren't following it or it will only marginally improve the quality of the video typically the value we're going to

get out of that is much less than the value we'd be getting out of solving other problems like lighting or calm or you know for this conference we're using a front projection setup and so people are walking through the projection you know so solving that problem for the future getting a rear projection screen and whatnot would would be an improvement over what we've got now so

okay yeah well thank you very much yeah definitely glad to and thank you for doing the video absolutely

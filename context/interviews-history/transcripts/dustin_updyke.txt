hi I'm Mike upson here with Dustin from the Pittsburgh software craftsmanship user group is one of the organizers that helps manage that group welcome Dustin I can you tell me a little bit about Pittsburgh software craftsmanship and you guys do so a couple of us you know came to this this last year yeah I really like the ideals there was an alternate meet grouping in Pittsburgh

that will meet pretty regularly and we liked the format of that and you know the diversity of the technologies things that they used and it sort of fizzled out and on the y but then it was really nothing right all of the big technologies had their own distinct groups it was an agile group and some of those things but there wasn't one that was sort of open format right you know

bring whatever sort of ailing you at the time to the table and and that's where things so nothing that was kind of just above the field of software development Chris more like Ruby Java is that what you're saying okay and I think a lot of us had day jobs where we were sort of using this stack and we had an interest in something else and we wanted you know just a friendly push place it on track

right right and the o net had some of that but you know even they weren't touching those other stuff that we wanted to look at my credits or or or a long ago or something like that something that we wanted to experiment in you know using for our day jobs but didn't have the opportunity to great dish did you have traction on okay then you know when we were kind of chatting a

little bit before I said something about oh you lead to group and you're like no it's not really done lead a group it's more of so it's somebody had more of a team committee it was was helping guide the group how does that work it's a small group we had started it probably six months ago and it was your traditional format right meet after work at a sort of a central location and for

a lot of us just didn't work because it was you know we were some other part of town it's hard to get there or it was you know I won't go and see my kids before it go the format is not working for me there you know the location i want to have a beer that that sort of thing so you know it's just sort of went away and you know we were just talking about coming here and oh we

should we should get back on track and and do that or try it again and you know i would say no one reads it but you know people jump in at different times and sort of offer or steer go we should try this or do that and you know it's it's pretty accepting to try things and it sounds like you have a group of people who have similar interest in it's a little bit of anarchy controlled anarchy

where we all kind of want to go in a direction we all generally same general direction but every now and then somebody else sticks on the leader hats and helps steer the direction or like look find a location is always sort of difficult because you you know maybe if you want to go and be in a restaurant where you can get something to eat right it's on the drink maybe that's not the

most conducive place to stand up and into a prison tailoring right so we sort of struggled with that and you know we we all went out and found their own what about this what about that and we just sort of voted on okay it wasn't a formal vote it was just hey let's try this meet me there at seven o'clock and let's see what happens oh and it was like hey this is working so that's toward more Greek

democracy than on chaos okay and so like has there been like a kind of a format that's emerged from that is there a tendency towards one type of meeting over another or um they're still experimenting you know I guess people have different thoughts on it we've we've gone to meetings where we didn't even open a laptop and we just talked about concepts talked about the other

problems that we were having right I moves from a traditional you know set up to a totally distributed team and so that we I know one meeting would you SAT there and talked about my problems and right people thought maybe I could try in order to fix this problem with that you know other times you know we've tried to work through kadas and things like that I think one of the big

motivators for me is what I have to do something it's not kada it's not an exercise but I need to do this so one of the guys on the team his wife works for a non-profit Pittsburgh they needed some new web technologies obviously in a budget for it right we said we would do it we sort of use github to anchor us on that sign tasks and you know to check ins and show

you that you want beyond just having group yes she did something will of course and averaging created something for community you know we wanted to do really and that's sort of how I met you yeah you know we wanted to use Redis and we wanted to do some of these other things and you know they have a free you know Oh pre set up but PHP only so you know we thought well you know you never

really get to pick a project with no constraints the customer wants yeah PHP it's free for life we should do that for them right so we so we went back and we said okay what can we do with that we can we can try to do it in a pure TVV style we can we can use github work distributed come together once a month or you know however often we do and sort of set the stage for the next sprint and

go to it and it's worked out it's been pretty interesting it's worked out pretty well for us it's very interesting yeah it's so more than just active learning you're actively creating something in a new kind of learning as a group how to create that's that's for interesting it's it's it's a style i haven't heard of I've heard about over the over the course of a people doing

presentations out people doing you know exercises where you guys are actually learning by creating so that's very interesting oh wait thank you very much dustin for chuckling me that's your arrow appreciate it

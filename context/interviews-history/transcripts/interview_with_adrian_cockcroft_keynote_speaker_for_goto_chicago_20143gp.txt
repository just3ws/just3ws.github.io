hi it's mike with you task to come here gonna go to comp 2014 and i'm standing here with adrian kolcraft who gave the keynote the kickoff talk here at the conference thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me i can you tell me a little bit about what your talk was about and and how you came to give that talk here at go to conf sure thanks for having me on this the the

talk really came from it's two pieces to it the first part was about how to speed things up and the speed of innovation being very important and how to think about what is innovation of what is disruptive rather than what is kind of the incumbent sort of existing companies and the way they do things and so there's this phrase that I kind of hinged it around which is it ain't what

you know that mrs. Europe it's what you know that ain't so it's a Will Rogers quote and a lot of times you tie that one yeah so with a lot of the disruptions that happen in this industry happened because any come burn figures out okay we're gonna do we have an idea we're going to we know how to optimize for that idea evil to build business model around it and then you go off and

build your business and then somebody else notices that one of your assumption to prolong it true and you're optimizing for something that used to be really expensive but now it isn't so and then you the the disruptor basically takes advantage of this thing that everyone else's assumes is a big expensive hard to do thing that has now become cheap and easy so you'd end up wasting a lot

of something and it looks horrifying to the incumbent right so they couldn't possibly do that you know but the you end up disrupting industries that when there's a number of examples that of that that I went through because I the first thing I think about is is data sob databases you know that we we have oracle and MSE ball that there are Microsoft they have these big monolithic

products but then along comes open-source products like my sequel and postcards which are now running with huge operations and before any so incredibly intense fee difficult project problems are solving but they're able to take in disrupt the business of polar I mean I Oracle so yeah so the really the open source itself is one of those did the concept of open source a

concept that the best software you could buy is the stuff you get for free that's built by a community is something that the sort of aliens are the the traditional enterprise software businesses where you have a product manager comes up with an idea and then they go when work on it for a few years and then they pop out with the product and try and sell it to you for a lot of

money and historically that was how you bought stuff you guys it was the best stuff you could get and these companies knew had were the places that new best have to build things and i work for a Sun Microsystems for a long time and you know part of that process but what really happened was the best things you can get now a free when they are built by communities and the best engineers

don't work at those enterprise companies they work for end users so you know the the most interesting scalable reliable software now is there are coming from source projects and I highlighted a few of those in the talk so that's one disruption another one I mentioned was solid state disk replacing spinning Russ the right of traditional disks and that the way that that has completely taken

what used to be a mutant multi-trillion dollar business or whatever it is in storage and if you look at the way that the Cassandra based appointment on AWS is there are no storage admins there's no Sam there's some SSD inside an instance and that's all there is until the person managing it is probably a Java distributed systems programmer great develop that type of person with a

little bit of operational experience to automate how to keep that thing up and running but there's no little layers and layers of sand fabrics and storage arrays have completely disappeared so it's not just that you disrupt the product you make the entire product category disappear that that's one of the most disruptive things that's going on right now I have to think about when

you're talking about trying to change the mindset of people have built their own business the entire business on a cert set up assumptions in looking and more about just a human work they're just reading an article about how people who have deeply held beliefs that they've internalized into their own persona their own their own personality becomes

Esther yeah and that's the only way to get them to change their thoughts you can't just say here's a fact that you what you know is wrong if they're just change literally the way they think and address their personality is that's something that I mean do you think about when we're dealing with these companies that are have these deeply embedded entrenched I should say not invented but

deeply entrenched processes like this is how we build software because this is how you determine the sub we develop products yeah and how we can approach do you talk about a little bit how we can approach those those kind of thought processes and in in a gas line and work within them sure so I talked about a few other things you have time yeah I haven't whole hour so there was a lot of

things I covered one of them was sort of continuous delivery as a as another way of disruptively speeding things up and the assumption you're making there is that you can you can move a lot quicker but the what it really comes down to is the the DevOps kind of approach where you're you're actually taking away the handoffs between teams so everyone knows that you know developers have to stay in

development and operations people run their code and they're different kinds of people and they optimize for different things but if you reorganize so that you put them in the same organization you blend those responsibilities and you automate everything it's not just the you create a dev ops team it's that you actually have to reorganize your company and it

have a cultural change so DevOps is in many ways a cultural problem and the companies that get over that other ones that are doing well so somebody tweeted a few days ago is DevOps ready for the enterprise that was questioned and my response was this the other way around the enterprises that are ready for DevOps are the ones they're going to disrupt the enterprises that aren't oh

okay sorry the out-group and I just either going to just knock out the ones that aren't yeah it's much harder to compete if you're running if you if every time you do a product release it takes me here to get it to customers and your competitors doing it in a few weeks and learning an opinion or run rings around you so that is the sort of existential challenge that a lot of

companies I make getting through right now as and the other big changes that software used to be a little thing on the side for a lot of companies are now its central its central for everything they do it's central to way they do marketing and sales and build things and the way support customers and the way they deal with products Internet of Things it's just one aspect of that but

what you're seeing is this whole software is the world driving people and married central they have to get good at it and so they're looking to the big enterprise company of the big web companies as examples of how to do that Netflix is one example is very very rapid development process Google Twitter Facebook or all of those companies are leading in this space and the

enterprises are underworld are trying to figure out how do we learn what we learn from the how do we adopter yeah ah tricor happy that was kind of the first part of the door in the second part with some more practical things about what that actually means in practice for a developer there's some techniques and you know I was trying to make it a little bit more hands-on in a bit more

detail so the tour was kind of a little into two sections yeah other the reason that what I was about to say is that I interviewed bill Scott who's with paypal and he talked about how it was fresh off of the acquisition of braintree and how paypal is trying to rethink their entire business process and they were looking at at at companies like Braintree who were able to deliver these things in a

lot of people in their press site that I heard were looking very skeptically and paypal acquiring brain trust thinking okay well I'm Braintree that's well that's going to bust the brain trusted Braintree it's like say that sometimes um but when he described it they said no where looking at how they do things in really trends figure out how to bring those

into our operations in a nutshell sure I wouldn't bill Scott when he was a netflix and I actually worked at ebay paypal back before I joined that place I get some of the challenges there you've got a successful business and it's working and then you have to you know PayPal has this big challenge from other financial processing stuff like square and stripe and whatever those companies

are you know we're more agile and paypal's trying to respond to that and they're doing a pretty good job and what what bills doing there is good work to move them strongly in that direction pretty good to see if you were to go and just flip a bit and everybody's ahead of us in your in your talk and have them take home at least one factoid what would or one idea what would you like to

have impressed on them the most I think from sort of questioning the assumptions you've got right look at their look of the way you're operating what you're doing and what assumptions you're making and if you're assuming something and optimizing for it and then you look at the trend for that thing and you know it's either going to suddenly stop being true or over time it's going to stop

being true make those explicit and get out ahead of those exotic so into the one of the key things that that because it tries to lean into the future if there's a trend towards cloud they'll get in early and they'll dive in and they'll learn how do we get good at it before it's really ready for mass consumption but and that is a very powerful technique for learning how to

take full advantage so once it becomes mass adoption you're already well optimized for it so you have that advantage hey well thank you very much for taking in terms we can be appreciated thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech unity fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for

user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at cna 2013 i'm sitting down with dave thomas on my name is prag dave on Twitter's and you're also you're the

founder of the pragmatic publishers and I correct along with andy hunter pragmatic programmers primary bookshelf yes and he would talk uh Davey of a talk called unknown knowns so thank you very much for taking the time to sodality I appreciate it unknown knowns that's that's very that's very philosophical almost very meta what's so hard to remember yeah said hi anon the nollans

so i mean the the inspiration if you're like for the title came from donald rumsfeld he gave a press conference back in 2002 where he talked about known knowns known unknowns and unknown unknowns when he was talking about you know the hunt for weapons of mass destruction and he left off the idea of unknown knowns that is things that have known but you don't know that you know

them great um and that to me is a really important concept because the reality is that's most of our knowledge most of our knowledge the ability to do just about anything we do talk for example is really buried way deep down below or conscious level and so that's an unknown known and the reality is if you want to do something proficiently perhaps surprisingly you have to do it without

conscious thought or without conscious intervention I guess it's more accurate so the question is how do you become proficient at doing things through intuition and there's a fair amount of research on exactly how you can do that I want to present like blink would that be an example Blinky's is along that lines blink is the idea of the using your intuition and I think blink is good

at a at a high level and it certainly makes a good strong point for using intuition I think blink is a little bit listed probably because it's a mass market for going but it the idea of like the five-second decision and I was kind of its it's not a bad idea but I think can also leave you quite it can lead you to be quite lazy the reality is that intuition there are there's a process to

gain intuition you don't just say oh I'm an intuitive person you know and therefore I'll make decisions without research the reality is that too to get to the point where you can make intuitive decisions you first have to go through the work of learning all the stuff that you can be deciding about and only after you've learned that and internalize that are you then in a

position to make those intuitive decisions yeah so you know for example a baby learning to talk is not going to learn words or sentences first they're gonna learn it sounds and then they can internalize those sounds get to the point where they can make them when they need to and only then can they then start learning words right and then they start getting their feedback cycle

exactly that oh when I said yeah daddy got really excited yeah right and that's something that's how we learn meaning we learn meaning not by being told that you know this object is daddy it's by having that feedback that tacit feedback and that's a really big part of this learning theory is that you learn things subconsciously by looking at the response that happens when one certain

stimuli occur you know if you can associate paint touching a stove for example then you're going to avoid heat in all circumstances sometimes without even thinking about it and that's the kind of thing we're talking about I think what I there's a few things that came to mind listening to your talk and I'm a parent I have three children and I'm going through my youngest is nine

months in oh she's nine months old on and watching the you know three children as their as their emergent consciousness are starting to try to figure out things that I take for granted for example my five-year-old is learning how to spell and we're sitting down and she was creating a for me of my checklist to pack for the conference and very sweet she's like

Daddy 8 we had to make a list admit press so she knows that there's a list and it's a boring and I'm sure she says well what do we need and it's okay we need a computer what does she write k right okay k well that no one has a/c in that when we sit down to write and I felt so bad because she ran in to see the FP h because we didn't have a computer a microphone in a suitcase so

poor thing he had a cage for a computer and after the the microphone and the sounds she wanted to write soo for soup cakes right I but went reasonably reasonably up and that's when you're able to teach and that's why I really appreciate your talk later when you mention them up going to the youth groups and teaching that's when we're in these situations where we are just

living our tacit state where we're just kind of complacently in our own thoughts and arm day to day experience working through the machinery that we've built up in our minds we don't think about those things that have just become wrote and then when you go back and you teach somebody who is completely naive to the entire concept of spelling or the entire concept programming that breaks you out

of your your little bubble it's like yeah that doesn't make any sense I think one of the things that I love to do I don't get to do enough of is a pair program to teach people a programming language used to do that all up with Ruby so someone say I want to learn Ruby so we'd sit down just for an hour and they would drive and we program Ruby and the reason I loved it

is because they would you know I would say well actually that's probably not the way we do that we're doing they'll see more great and it forces you to re-examine all of these like habits that you get into and do you dig back into that conscious side to work out why things go on but to your point though when you're done about being you know sort of happily oblivious in your in

your tacit state I think that's actually one of the big mistakes that people make is they get to a point where they can live life taciturn and that's that's easier than having to think about everything all the time right now so you kind of like start getting onto autopilot and it's not just one just Prairie autopilot in terms of your your rest of your life as well you know

you're maybe even your family or relationships whatever it's just kind of like it's all handled for you somewhere in your subconscious and I think that's dangerous I think it's very dangerous to become stale it sounds very boring what it's boring but I think you could also miss so much so one of the things I think that's really key is to always start always to build on those tacit

layers that you have and one of the one of the theories about this tacit learning is that you have to learn it in layers so in the same way that babies learn sounds then words then sentence it you know we're learning programming languages or whatever else techniques whatever works for us these are all layered and so once you have one layer master you owe it to yourself to them to

go to the next letter to push them build on that so maybe you've load a programming language okay so now learn how to do certain things with that language learn how to use certain light resigned once you've got that nailed go off a look at your problem remains although the new language whatever it might be but always keep learning it's

interesting my my wife might travel to China out a lot and so she decided last year Christmas time that she wanted to learn Mandarin so she started to learn she's doing really well and obviously the pressure has been on me to do the same now I might my brain is really mad at hearing sounds of differentiating sounds and so it's very very hard for me to listen to Mandarin and then try to

reproduce it and it's been very interesting and humiliating for me to go back to being a beginner speaking and it's in a way it's actually been very fun because what it's done is it's kind of like reminded my brain how to be a beginner again and I found that in some ways that's kind of freed me up on the programming side as well right and it's interesting you say that about I have

members my family or from Europe and their english is my father second language and you know we've had discussions about polish and english and trying to get them to explain why is the lamp female right it just is and then then again why is wise microphones built with ph you know exactly I don't know sacred yo and it's things that we've tested Lee accepted you would just

attaches where it is it just this but some it also reminds me that when you're the beginner sometimes when you're one of the scary things and I think one of the scariest things for people wonder when they're looking at learning something new or making a massive / change like a few years ago I went from being a dot net developer on the Microsoft platform to being a ruby

developer with a mac and you know a terminal and I want from being competent in being able to be strong and and just coming in and execute on the problem too I don't know what how to change directories you know I really i'm not quite it but I yeah you know how do I clear the screen I don't know and it's incredibly humbling where you're completely hobbled and then if you're

able to even take it further step back and look at that and say how are other ppl center has hobbled thinking about the people who you know like an immigrant who was coming to America and this is driving a taxi here but was a doctor back home if what I'm a reason they've chosen that you know this this bath or were forced on this bath but you never know where somebody's been in

humble to save themselves so it can be a key step towards empathy by becoming a burner in completely stripping yourself down almost you the bare bones and feeling that pain and then being able to look at somebody else to try to reflect that in that there's another side to that too I mean you're absolutely right but the again the theory says that beginners of things require guidance

it's not just you know they get it wrong if they don't have guns they actually require it in order to learn they need to have context free instruction okay so where as an expert or even someone who's got moderate experience would be able to fill in all the gaps and you know understand that okay you said this but it doesn't really occur in this circumstance of the gross for a beginner

you have to be very directive and you kind of like get out of the habit of directing people I mean you do it a little bit with little kids because again they're beginners of things no but really you feel bad or you feel like you're being rude telling people do this then do that the other the reality is if you're dealing with a beginner that's exactly

what you should do doesn't matter if they're nine months old or 90 years old is there a beginner then he told me if if you're learning to parachute right you really don't care about the physics of or the aerodynamics of the shoe or anything else you just want to be told what to pull it and way yeah all right that's the sum total yeah you want you want rules yeah and that's what

beginners need and so although yes the empathy side is important i think it's also important to understand how to interact with people as they're learning and the interesting thing about that is it implies that your direction styles on a change of time it's going to start off being very directive but as they get experience it's going to become more and more collegial right you know and so I

think you can see the good managers are people that do that instinctively who are directive at one Monday and then six months later there is good a bit more back so I be kind of like you know you know go do that could be good right right yeah and I'm in your talk you talk to you describe the Donald Rumsfeld quote that probably every American has heard already but sigh about the you

know things that we know of the week you can look it up but the that their quote though you said there was one aspect missing right and that was the unknown knowns and I just wanted to say that there was it made me think about this quotes that what I don't know if it's ever been established that Don Rumsfeld was quoting this but there's an old or Lisa it's attributed to it as an old

Arabic paraphrase but I really enjoyed it she's me proverb and it was that he that knows and knows not that he knows is asleep waking and that just makes me think about what you were just saying about being on autopilot and trying to find somebody you can wake you and question what you yeah but you know I think that's part of it but it's em yeah you're absolutely right and that's part

of the larger feedback loop which is don't get complaints make sure there's still conscious of what you're doing but on a day-to-day level being in that state of not knowing is actually the most important thing if I was to throw a ball and you want to try and catch it by thinking about I have to catch this ball so let's think words can come down probably over here

I've got to move my hand like this and then over my fingers off now if you're trying to do that the bull be on the ground long before you've got the handout right right because you have to add the conscious level you're just too slow right but if i said to you how do you catch a ball you and bill to tell me you know baseball players entire career is based on being able to do something

they cannot tell you how they do it it's and people try to study how they do it and there's like little tricks that they do do I try and keep a constant angle and I'll just sent in this kind of stuff but it's very very difficult to describe and the thing that I try to get across to developers is that's a good state to be in all right getting to the point where you operate autopilot maybe not

quite the right word for it but where you can operate instinctively means that you can be coding and another part of your brain the conscious part of your brain is looking at yourself coding and it's that looking at yourself as giving you the feedback to to do it better right and fine-tune things so I'm not saying that you've got it in you become an intuitive coder and at that point all

freezes and you're an expert and you know people genuflect what happens is that you get to that level and now you finally have the ability to improve yourself by monitoring yourself you know you're Blake you're now using two parts of your brain intrude upon which is kind of subconscious below the little conscious and then the conscious part can look at what you're doing right and

say hey you know what if you try to do this differently and then try to train the subconscious part to do that and that's exact same process you're going to train it by repetition by remaining sort to do this by giving yourself feedback so i think it's it's yeah it's good to reevaluate and to never to do everything just on autopilot the whole time right

now at the same time you have to accept that the only way to be effective in any real-world activity is through this tacit knowledge and so in a way it's it's it's a very programming your brain that you like to sit down and we write code that it automatically goes and runs but we do some thought so that way you can do that and then we train ourselves to do a certain activity so that way we

can just let it go sometimes and slit that automation extent I don't think it's quite the scientific it's closer to a bloody drug car for example I mean when you first let me drive a car your white knuckle punch in the wheel you are yeah there's too much going on it's simplified down to you know a couple of petals on a steering wheel and that's it right and if someone says watch out for

that pedestrian are going over there I mean you freak out because you can't think about that pedestrian you're still too busy to steering and everything else and after a while as that experience starts to build gradually the number of factors that you can take into account grows and I think it's the same I'd like to fly a plane and amazingly you can actually solo typically most people a

soul of a plane after about five or six hours in structure and that's a really wild thing I mean if you fly around a little bit and then you know some point your instructor lands you gets out of the plane and says okay go to do a circuit and you do that circuit and it is the most tiring thing you've done in that guarantee because you are thinking constantly I mean you there's no spare

neural everything it's thinking probably your adrenaline level oh yeah yeah but it's it's like you know I have to do this into this room to this level you know and it's like it's a miracle in on survives everybody does then you don't get your license for probably another 50 hours and that 50 hours is spent doing these things over and over again and get them

to the point where you can sit back and look at the bigger picture and it keeps going I mean airlines hire pilots with 10,000 hours you know senior pass about 20 to 25 minutes and that's because they have basically they've seen it all but not just that the internal my civil and interestingly the best pilots are the ones who don't necessarily follow the rules they write the rules but they

don't have to follow oh yeah if you can write the rules then you've already established yourself at a certain level when you're starting to think beyond the rules well and you can deal with situations where the rules no longer apply there's a famous case of a pod I was a US airways pilot mrs. name know how something up and he was flying cross-country and he the engine in the

tail blew up and that's in theory not a big deal because he had two other engines and the plan just one unfortunately this particular blog sent fan blades through all of the hydraulic lines or sorry hydraulic lines for all of the hydraulic systems so there are three hydraulic systems at a minimum a plane this actually disabled all of them so he had no hydraulics that's literally

the worst he's yeah and he could not control any of the control surfaces on the plane there's no manual control so the plane was basically on fire both going to the book nothing he could do but he had you know 25,000 hours or something he happened to be flying with another instructor pilot on the jump seat and his copilot was very experienced and between them they work

at a brand new way of flying airplanes using the throttles and they did that the rule books did not apply when none of the manuals mean basically if you open the that everybody every plant hasn't pulled apart operating handbook which is kind of like instruction through and you go to the red tab which is emergencies and look for total hydraulic failure it basically

says kiss your ass good-bye right you know hope you brought a parachute Yeah right and they basically didn't even bother they just said okay we'll work this out and they worked out and they got this thing and they landed the plane at Sioux City Iowa simply using the throttles and they saved I don't know how many hundred lines mean there was a crash because at some point in the

throttles back to land right that point they lost control the plane but they managed to get the thing down on the ground which is stunning and that's only because they had the experience in the intuition to be able to predict or to be able to yeah initially predict and then learn very quickly how the plane reacts when it's flown in a totally unique kind of one and you know just coming towards

the end but saw I'm thinking about the vm er what the levels of mastery and that sometimes when you get to a certain level of mastery it's hard for or maybe they call a person to be evaluate the difference between different levels of mastery and I'm thinking about I went in and saw a dance performance and I just thought it was beautiful but then I heard the person who was a dancer next

piece and all that person over there wasn't totally with it and you know I've watched I wouldn't know by this but I used to skateboard extensively not when I watched videos of skateboards I can tell oh my god that person is amazing like what they're doing and then others eyes you know he's just doing rudimentary stuff yeah sure it's big but it's it's very common stuff and in

programming sometimes I think because what we do is so much in our head and then into code and then really the interface that you can have with that it's very limited it's hard to tell when you're looking at it at books or an open source code or for another program and trying to evaluate where they stand as far as professionals do you have you probably thought into

how you evaluate what is what is good and this is kind of deflecting on a panel talk ever participated in earlier towards what is what is a metric from being able to evaluate whether or not either another individual programmer is its competence and is what their level of mastery is so when you're soon down to teach somebody or looking at somebody who's going to be working with you you

kind of have to have that's like okay where do they stand in the continuum do you have you have you ever thought about how you look at somebody and evaluate their birth school level yeah I mean first of all I'm going to say that I am possibly the world's worst recruiter I have a habit of either recruiting perfect people for the job or absolutely you know the devil incarnate it's like

one of the other account at the middle point kind of like the money act it's yeah kind of like that but it's just like I don't know why it is but I maybe I just trust my intuition too much but I think there's a couple of things you can look for particularly face to face if you join to somebody one and it's not it's not binary there's a combination of factors one thing I look at is how they

respond to mistakes if you are a beginner then a mistake is like a serious thing right oh you know its own made a mistake and apologized whatever else if you are more advanced than you realize that mistakes happen the news can have to fix it you know and so a more advanced person would just kind of laugh it off and get on and fix it and ideally you know comment on

how it happened why it happened and how you'd stop it happening again you know similarly the more advanced people are capable of doing one thing at the same time so as their coding they may be talking to you you know and ideally give me a commentary on what they're doing and so I looked for that a little bit you know can I sit there and chat while their coding whatever else so I think

those are the kind of external indicators you can also look at the code and say I don't know how to describe it it's one of these I know I want to see it things right it's good code as a kind of simplicity and kind of cleanliness a structure and small things like good developers I think my experience is that good developers will care more about not just the logic of the code but also the

presentation of the code they like producing sins they look nice and there's good reasons for it but it's typically a kind of like third order effect so you only start seeing that more experienced people I don't have an exact answer but I mean those are the kind of things that I'm hoping to see well thank you very much for taking off under stone thank you I really

appreciate the opportunity ok user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today at Utah State calm you you

hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here go to town for 2014 i'm sending here with Fred Georgia programmer anarchist who's going to be talking about programmer anarchy thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me what is programmer a key and I mean I don't see a big a and you're going to do it whether she not just well actually programmer key is kind of a sort of a

natural property Fineman of the agile processes I think the more you push agile processes the more you learned over time about how fast things can go and get google fasters and other things and somebody it was a label I apply this prank a Capri controversial a boring oh but it does have the traditional sense of Anarchy which is a team that's basically self-organizing very orders

any chaos doesn't mean chaos which is number two definition but in every one definition is a group that the organization is actually determined from within the group rather than being imposed from the outside of the group ok a little book is conditionally called a visible hook which was about the social organization of pirates oh really and you think about pirates didn't have a

rule book that says you're going to be captain you can be captain for three years and we rotated first mate become captain there's no rule look there you've what I've seen these these Pirates are eventually more for the organization is they needed to get this from A to B this guy who is very good at organizing people whose fair will be in charge but what gets to be a

technet marking ship is some other crazy do waving a saver jumping your girls doing silly things and so to summer you want the team to be the same way say here's a team has a problem you guys organize yourself and it may be over time projects change their focus changes the needs of the project change may be different people in there but you want that organization sort of didn't know

that because other people to know what the best and when those regular points are people whom the outside looking in baby to reviews trying to stuff like that they don't really know that magic moment when changes are necessary right but we could even we can afford a role somebody off right so we try to you know basically try to push that back into the team so basically this is kind of

self-organizing team concept under give her a controversial label right or is it is a more just trying to use that term and our key to a encourage a thought like it is I mean I totally took a page out of Kent Beck's book he called it extreme program and i can tell you back back in the day when you talked about that and I had this conversation with Kent it's like dude

this name is very scary when I go to corporate client that say I want to extreme program they're already scared of programmers enough extreme that's really scary yeah she's jumping up buildings what are these guys will be doing but it got the attention and I mean eventually kind of water down they call it agile that was a bunch more except full workup report so I try to do

the same thing you know push the programmer eric is being sorta get your attention but we're organizing you don't have to call it anarchy it basically is a self-organizing teams or other people that talk about this as well okay so it's just a night in its kind of putting out a seed for people to you to pay attention and hear the word but to get them thinking about no we don't

necessarily need to have always top down out in organizations because I gotta say I didn't really come by I came up with the term I'll take credit for the term or they blame for the term but the organization itself is something I observed one of the companies I worked with in in London and basically was a small group but they basically started doing these things first so they didn't

have any project managers I really uh nope it was the idea where programmers we know how to get the stuff out the door who's whispering they're necessary i don't need EPA's i want to talk to customer directly don't need a QA because QA is a very complex process and complex systems and it sounds like programmer work to be an architect work so we came with this kind of very flat

structure says we're developers in fact we actually got rid of all the even managers of the developers it was a concept of a manager of a golfer so basically developers it says get the code out the door and we kind of pushes up the interaction level with a customer we sort of started out most agile things is about stories it's like customer Lascelles story will do it but tell the

holodeck story just do it tell you know the story let's do it right we went to we raise that up to say tell me what you want to accomplish and then get out of our way right because we know how to best execute this we're smart we can pick up domains they say oh no you don't understand my debate is really complicated you're saying gee you think your domains more complicated that

closure right or more complicated the tools I work but I'll switch with you in two days you will sort of see but yeah i don't think i can understand complex stuff you don't understand my world right right it's programming is complexity and we and we embrace it we have it's coming out like a fire hose we absorb it and we keep doing this so accounting I'm sorry

counting's pretty pretty well the same as the Phoenicians and you know and look at these various fields and there's nothing really new you there compared to the rapid changes that we have in our domain right yeah it's a code of viable system in that you can write it in code but almost kota file i mean a code itself is almost not go to file its kind of crazy and one of the things we take

advantage of is how fast we can go now so you know with the advent of the cloud I can now get virtual machines quickly and it's not a matter of having to plan what's gonna happen for the next year and go get the capital budget approved and I don't do those things you know I get one in five minutes yeah it was making money I get another one in five minutes you know it's not a matter of

having to pre-plan all this stuff and so as a cycles got faster faster this concept of specializations because we're difficult to implement you know the handoffs between various people can be absolutely crazy yeah and in with the the focusing on a micro focus that kind of mixture think about the micro services which are also known for for talking about is that are these related

is there is the anarchy and the self-governing similar to like the goal of keeping services very small focused and it turns out the ducktail very nicely you know I really thought they would be orthogonal issues that there's this process and there's architecture and they're orthogonal it turns out there actually a highly interrelated we want to go faster our businesses allowed

us to go fast crew doing internet advertising through google time and you get feedback cycles than 20 minute time frame from something i don't do it in google it to 20 minutes i'll start getting feedback about it pretty fast and it was news the cycle times it kept driving us saying okay let me the specialist let's talk to a separate QA process let's use some techniques like a

be testing and some other things like that sort of keep driving you code out there we have to the point we were delivering something new in a production about every three and half minutes you know four digits for dishes oh yeah three minutes is you're talking about 10 hours in the previous interview from my idea to inception but now you're talking three minutes well it was the irish

we've ever program is basically basically shipping twice a day yeah in the clásico entire organization and it would ship something small it's a small enhancement either works it doesn't work it doesn't work stop doing if it does work you know feed I let's do something else and we basically create a feedback system that let us work in these domains that have

fast feedback we were able to exploit these domains we frankly we avoid any domain that would say bill a product you gotta figure out its gonna take six months to figure out where the successful or not he stay away from those domains we're in e-commerce for internet advertising that sort of thing no what I hear about like small self-sufficient teams I ironically I

think more about like the military in the squad structure where you have a smallest unit of self-organized or internal structure where it can be everybody communicates with everybody else and they can all work off of each other but they still have to be able to operate inside of a larger system even though these programmers are are working independently and able to define their

own way to deliver but they still have to exist inside of an ecosystem a larger organization sometimes well how do you what should be even though going back to against squad systems particularly in some of the Western militaries are a very good example of this to give objectives so here's if subject I want to accomplish we think it's we think it's gonna we think it's going to

succeed we think it's good chance of succeeding but we know that when you get in there and actually try to do it you know trying to micromanage you remotely is that going to work you're a newbie in that environment they've a cross trained around around skills I mean they're they're racing very poly skilled workers in their own practice race and that works very well but is it but some of

the objectives of the high/low very important tell him how to execute the objectives not some important you want to train them you want to make sure they have the right skills and the skills across the team cover the whole special things they might run into right but then also running something surprising they'll either innovate or they will draw you know they do the right things

and you want the program teams to be very much the same way yeah and looking at not just programmers but stepping outside of our day to day programming world Mike some focus on the community as well and i look at user groups do you see any correlation between the desire to solve define what you're working on it being reflected inside the community at all and is that totally

know there's a source of analogies there to some degree you'd look at some of the best open source projects and you look at K who's who's the manager and who's the business guy use the QA team they've met those roles right is this they're basically a deathly self-organizing you know if you guys saw row the commitment rights and everywhere else it sorta contributing and they get invited to the

party of their really good contributor and be inside the group but they basically it's the same sort of structure see the same things about startups you know you get a new startup and everybody knows what they're working on there they don't as a programmer I know exact what business were in and I know what marking stands but somehow when we get these things a larger we

feel it need it but a CTO in place who's going to seem to of this and the business team is going to shield me from this and all of a sudden this organization i'm not sure what i'm working on and why am i working on it yeah and when you say shield it's like all about the encapsulation in that maybe even that sounds like you be protection and then they wanted solves

and it becomes a little bit about like you want to put up these barriers to protect your own interests well it's some degree it's also VC sometimes pushing you to put a formal structure in place because they were thinking about okay you go to become SAP one of these days we need the structure and you're gonna have a name to CTO you gotta have names to CFO you gotta have these titles

and people start thinking about the title is actually part of their job instead of hey we're still trying to solve problems we want to make sure everybody understands what problems were trying to solve right so the company in London we kind of went out of our way to make sure we never put that structure in place no and we ever try to do that when my roles was make sure it says no no we

don't want this sort of organizational structure we must keep ourselves fairly loose and undifferentiated some level keep our resources flat no and we made us very successful in business because of that and you know just one thing as we were walking into this interview I asked about social hierarchy are you looking at and I doubt you just use the term and our key just strictly to be

controversial and get people's attention but maybe you love actually it is pretty much just pretty much sir it is strictly a marketing term okay if you look at you peel back the covers we still believe in basic principles of of agile we believe in feedback we believe in communication we blew it simplicity of leave encouraged with even respect it's just that when you start

putting practices around us particularly in light of microservices all of a sudden microservices you know 20 30 lines of code do need a unit test probably not nice only 23 lines of code you can't do that find yourself a new career and we don't care what language writing because it's already infant leave every other piece of code so you right when it Ruby I could i want to

closure and you can turn around say we write my individual basic out of the mare because this one stressful interfaces and jason packets fight run something no got if you don't care right and so you're you're all you're really asking people is understand what it is and if you don't like it replace it it's not a matter of having to refactor it in fact why would use design patterns 30

lines of code why would you worry about you know any of these sorts of things because it's 30 lines of code yeah and all the same problem I 30 lines of code though but there yep so it's kinda like yo cells of your body anything about it this is your your so you yeah but no those cells that you were born with it there anymore they're dead they're gone they're gone but you're still you but

your complex organism oh and so I think our systems are very complex when you talk about systems that have millions of lines of code in them whether it's broken into three line services or one giant you know it's rude to me and my code tarball is complicated you still know how it's working right so you don't necessarily anything with microservices a complex environment you don't just say

gain anything either except if you're having to be outsourcing this piece of code you just turn it up be a horrible program are you writing this really ugly microservice the impact is always service I can rewrite three lines of code i rewrite it yeah the damage you can do my applications is very constrained because of micro services so by keeping things super small being able

to say okay if there's something that goes wrong you can narrow down on set one execs and I've happen to be like how to replace this monolithic thing that has all these interval and some of the problems with operating systems that we've discovered over the years is yes you build a really lovely octubre system has all these same traits but here comes the program doesn't know anything he

starts ripping the data out of it starts putting publishing getters and setters all over his method start putting the data out now everybody knows this data is running the algorithms every place now you can't change anything right microservice it's a little hard to go in there grab an internal piece of data right unless you're going to open this up and put it you make the I in it right

so it actually is visiting a sort of capsulation carried to a really extreme that's very powerful okay well thank you very much for days and kind of souvenir appreciate thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations pepero of information find out for yourself today at Utah State com

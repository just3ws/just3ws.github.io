hi Mike with you tasik here again at SCA absolutely never with Mark Simpson who's organizing the code and cocktail in Boston the Boston khodam cocktail uh vs boston tea uh but I've heard of code in coffee okay and that's in the morning i'm guessing that coding cocktails is not a morning thing yeah probably drinking there that's a bad sign unless his hair of the dog so as i was about to

start before you press the buttons the history is that one or two years ago at SC na i heard about coding coffee I thought that was fantastic i hear because coffee but in boston i felt no one else got up as early as i did and there wasn't coffee shops that sound like they would be conducive to that sort of stuff but I then suddenly jump to the conclusion of we should go for

cup going for drinks right because I wanted to have a social just a little slight networking some chatting right which is strange because I think of myself as an introvert but so I on the Boston supper craftsmanship mailing list I said maybe during one of the meetings or something I asked how people if they want to go for drinks and it was originally just Zack the organizer and a

guy that went to meetings Moss must call and we wanted for drinks and then the next month I said I actually mailed out and once go and six people show and it's been going for six months now oh really I'm surprised every time yes how do you I I mean is it something that you break out laptops or you know yeah so my only ground rule is that there will be code and copy the code could be talking about

good ok because sometimes when you have some cooked cocktails you can't do much yeah but but we have actually broken out laptops unlike coding coffee which is the idea of working on people's projects I wouldn't trust anyone with couple cocktails to do that so we've done some coding exercises okay Zach came up with this idea based upon the surrealist party game called the

exquisite corpse and called the exquisite codes okay where I read a test and I hand you the laptop and you have to make the test pass Oh touch my test but I can't I can't help you at all you can't do anything right and it goes around we see what happens at the end we see where it ends up okay um so that could be fun after a few cocktails yeah the first time we did that it ended up

with a guy writing a test that in our spec to make it pass it just said it should fail fail so the next guy in line who didn't know much ruby was learning it he redefined failure oh and he won he basically really yeah you just redefined failure to true and so you're awesome yeah so yeah you've won the night yeah but some nights it's a it we're talking about code like about testing and

mocking you know the same show things you hear out here we're just chatting informally sometimes it boils down to a couple people are complaining about their jobs right but I think as a guy who just complain about my job a lot right you probably remember I think it's useful to do that sometimes as long as it doesn't get too negative you can play a bunch of job people try to help you by

saying maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel yeah or have you tried this or you know there's different ways that you can help you everybody so sometimes it give me a sympathetic ear or just that same yeah yeah I know I've been there as well maybe it'll get better or hey you can you can quit yeah and some point I think I heard that so I guess yeah that's code encode cocktails their

husky cocktails there has to be code at least the discussion there oh okay great so I mean it's a very social say yes I'm very social right now we just happen to always go to the same bar that no one has suggested anywhere else works for me sorry if you're worse but and that's one of the things that that's our key in running a user community my experience is that it has also work for

people that are organizing yep so as long as it works for them and then other people are happy and having a good time then everybody's have a great time and that's how the community went yeah when I first thought of this i was thinking like live be an organizer and oh no I threw us up so I kept it very like I said you can show up if you once you don't show up if you don't want you a

hundred on my own yeah I don't care i'll be at this bar this time come online great well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down thank

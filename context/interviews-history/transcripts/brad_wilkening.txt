hi I'm right with you test to come here at Sen egg and sitting there sitting down with bread wilkening who is a co-founder of death mind software and they're very active in the community bread has been actively community for a while they as he has have you co Ronnie the uchicago webcam and also on the craftsmanship other craftsmen on craftsmen night out in the open half you

just mentioned that song about that one so that's what that's a bunch of all events to be involved in hi you know going in going just meeting this is already takes up enough time but running all those beauties I mean how do you how do you manage doing all these events and actually also what what is craftsman right how you know so let's start over the Chicago webcam so we saw that

there's a mean in Chicago for conference was focused on front-end technologies and design I think that's a really important area we think that there's old this kind of this new position coming out of nowhere called the front end developer and I think we need to foster that in such designs it's knowing those tools all UX the JavaScript and CSS and knowing how to organize that stuff

welcome can really help your project if I go along if you will and so we saw it either and you're like okay well that's been a try we sold out the first year 115 tickets and then we saw a lot this year with 300 and something tickets so one of the things we try to do with it is we try to keep it less expensive so it's attainable you want to don't usually

dollars yes and we're sitting on that survey I think later today or sometime soonish that is going to ask whether how people really just want to pay more money so we have more room and more of you know it's easier to spend five thousand dollars on the food if you had more money to work with lumber you know we're moving strapping in so there's a lot of overhead that we can ideally yes

we are infected we're going to do that again next year sometime in the fall is your exact over 6 which also happens to be my birthday was really terrible everything huh exciting right I mean for a kind of as you just kind of want to get her done yeah with my other stuff it's kind of different than that though right like some refreshments night out the way that I get people would come

that is that basically just tell them well we basically get together in talk about our projects so i can i say that's something that's like Oh I'm going that yeah yes I'm like the time is cathartic right you have a cheeseburger and you yeah we're gonna have a good time with it and it's always fun you know no trolling role recruiters have shown up in the past and we're typically

very abusive to them so they've found that they don't show up anymore but you know we kinda want to keep it like that where it's all just a bunch of coders in a room kind of hanging out occasionally laptops come on you know that's probably one but we're totally cool with that as well can be as merry as it needs to yeah coders got co comprehend yes coders

gonna code haters gonna hate is that the main we're going on yeah yeah sure I i I'm shameless I live over here that one is like 300 something people want i'm on meetup and that took a while to grow it out and it's grown over the years it was originally called software craftsman who happened to like whiskey and that occurred because i was like i don't know maybe some people join us as kind of

silly and i know i have a bunch of friends that drink whiskey and writes opera so let's do it and like in the first moment we had like 50 people that signed up for it and the tendons was like 20 or 30 people every time i was like oh this is a good idea yeah i kept getting people that were like hey you know i don't like whiskey like it doesn't matter being silly yeah i feel

your cell along the same is yeah saw a part of craftsmen who happen to like whiskey nobody ever came up with a name like that where they weren't entirely kidding but after you got up to a certain point basically every month we have at least 20 or 30 people we get a wide variety to it's not just people that are doing the ruby or the java its people all across board 1 medic guy

comes pre mob and he's super cool yeah and you know it is literally every possible way that I could think of it just coming out because it's not tied to this is a ruby diamond she wanted this listen oh i thought this I thought you liked here is it's just Pressman and it's a very broad and if you if you're so many jerks lost your crafting come on code and it gets pretty nerdy so yes but

you know after about being there for two hours basically we're almost incoherent we talking trash to each other which is a magical environment well it has part of the important things we strum screw or think about tools or i got prior to closing with our tool senses that when you kind of puts the texts away in platform fights away we all have basically the same interest we all have

the same product yeah good work we're the entire same group of people and you know the there's always this kind of animosity between the communities that i think is just completely silly and so I'd say everybody just come to all the you know so I've been going to the Python ones because they're just fun and you know I learned something about Python there's something to be learned

there was brightly what worth everything has a grievance meeting ever yes he is a he's the only other extrovert in Chicago yeah as a software engineer it's me and brian ray that's our claim to fame quick around and up but you have one other group of all the open a hack yeah so here's here's where I get weirder is that there's this thing that was posted on github and it was open hanko calm and

we noticed it and we noticed that there wasn't a Chicago one so we here in the natural response that is going to be go hey we'll take it yeah especially did yeah and it's gone from zero people too and he took like 70 in two weeks Wow and I'd like to know also that it's not a kid help thing it's just you know a bad thing yeah and we didn't realize that at the time we were trying to figure out

what it was or why it was yeah we were just like Oh me I'm gonna beat up this kind like that let's try to transverse it into this we have another one called the open-source bug bash okay but we we limited to twelve people when they all have to be fairly experienced just to join the group we asked questions the people that haven't been deliver

yourself an ulcer yes so that's it that's interesting you you have a gated group so it's like you have to be that sort of brain and that's a kind of an interesting perspective for a lot of law you should research I figure out how to appeal to people who don't pass I just going to be played only talked about always bring a new blog haven't had the instructor e topics but how do you

satisfy people who been down the road one and four open for open source bug bash it's kind of a weird thing because one of the reasons in these folks are coming is because it's a smaller group and they just like small right I talked to Evan like one time come to find out he thinks it's smaller groups or better the big after party didn't like it's mush we ended up back at this hotel room

this is not an appropriate statement although anybody that knows me hun it's probably expecting a common one but we're there with Aaron Kalin Corey and keep from from club and just this nice group of people whom all just kind of wanted to have some good whiskey and sit around and shoot the and that's kind of the same people that we end up getting a minus whiskey plus laptop at

open source both match we actually had somebody very last time any Lester at Chicago webcam do Danny Lester and we met Andy there he's been a cool friend of ours since then yeah he has a very interesting guy yeah somebody would switch where Jesus bless two shoes yes what's up yes sir so you're able to have a pretty open thing or just anybody can come into it with progressive not

out its kind of open-door policy for any of you open a quick up something that's a little more open but the doc the higher end or more a little bit more sophisticated group in some cash which I'm assuming you many code back into your project yeah there's anything particular or you focus on oh no no like we're just trying to we're starting to figure that part out really about what

we do we're going to do is we're going to have people write on the board what they're going to hack on and whether or not they're willing to take care okay and so somebody comes in and they're fixing above the rails somebody else walks in and says oh yeah so that bug on here that who did knock that one out so that's basically more or less the way that we try to approach it now open and

since it's going to have a larger audience potentially some younger blood and some more junior folks we're going to have that same format but we're going to have that same format in an environment where pretty reasonable we're doing it in the braintree space okay you'll never been there but I heard it's really super awesome and huge so we're probably going

to have a pretty big turnout for those events and you know it is there's a good reason people are coming here people come here because it is an open source thing and maybe want to kind of help out for that stuff yeah and have you reached out to any local tragedy just like all this a cool project be like this things we want to point it so is it it's anything literally give your whiteboard

where you write your name and what what library your hat on perhaps you know which bum you're going to try to attack but it's more or less just to you know create the environment of approachability for anybody to attack against something and you still won't know we're going to like that where that dude is put a number on their head oh I'm sorry let's say that whenever I walk

up a program like Fred Weil getting working on this Oh nobody knows who I am right we have only just goes bad yeah it was working on me because you're recommending it does get a little gnarly yeah lets up so but going to the budget are competent descargar 17 said about responders so you say to prefer the smaller groups because they're loaded what why is that y y 4 y de depósito

firs smaller rooms on the run along in a hole so to speak for Evan right yeah it's because I don't know anything funny to say here so it's not gonna be any kidding so I think it's actually just kind of it's a dichotomy it's a natural dichotomy in human behavior you like to have some quiet time you'd like to have some busy time and you need both and both are very

healthy and have healthy and have benefits so if you do both are going to be happy with the results of it and you know that's not a very objective thing to say I'm basically just saying it'll be amazing but but more or less there are also just people that don't function well in larger groups people they're going to try to consolidate themselves into a single group and that is a

totally natural introvert thing to do and even us extroverts like me and Brian Wright are willing to every now and then say yeah that was a cool meet up of all five of us yeah you know and we've got a lot done when you talked about some cool stuff and who who cares but it's always that it's different i underscore it's keeping like I said shameless yes you're most definitely keeping a raid alongside

um but yeah that's that's the kind of the onset of those those events and some people try to use those Pro hiring you know like there's a new one that move it but it's basically just it's a recruiting firm that's putting on these presentations that may be great and we're not trying to doing that we we like the effect of people showing up and interacting with each other or do we do

staring it the guy talking yeah we you know that's no big thing for that a time not really really harness that or get that hug okay well thank you very much better offense itself

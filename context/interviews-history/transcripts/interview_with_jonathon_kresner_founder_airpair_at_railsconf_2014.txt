hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at railsconf 2014 and i'm standing here with jonathan cozner who is the CEO of air pear and i just want to be clear that we're going to be talking about a commercial product but this is not a paid placement i just think that what he's doing is very interesting and it has a lot of possible positive ramifications for small individual

developers and freelancers who want to be able to reach a larger audience so you know thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me and can you tell me a little bit about what air barriers and how you know freelance developer or a open source developer who's doing stuff can take advantage of putting themselves on that marketplace yeah so most simply air pear is a

community of developers helping developers so you can either come to the site if you are stuck for example on money in your framework or you have a bug that's really got you you know units and arca yeah you can easily put in whatever technology is that that you're using anything crossing everything on stack overflow and then people who enjoy helping other people right particularly

over like the format of pet programming and on our network everything's done a video chat can come along and teach you things free so it's an opportunity for developers to stay on stock on one side but also other developers to mentor and basically know in the process of teaching which in itself is very rewarding and and they also get paid by now for doing right so yeah that's

really going to come sounders we all we all have to pay the bills yeah and we only had to find work and it can be hard to compete in it you know it going and finding a contract but maybe being able to do a little bit of extra work inside right right right so what we call the expert side of a marketplace which is the people that are helping people the real value proposition for them is that

we basically take away all the hassle of doing your own marketing so you get to focus on exactly what you love doing and that's coding and helping people on the new tricks and sharing the knowledge of those new tricks and then we do all the grunt work of promoting you so we can create like a profile that basically summarizes your bio and then we go out and find people

that need help and then reconnect the two together ok so it's it see I've seen like advertisements on Stack Overflow for Ryan big who does the rails in action book p um I think that so that's that's the correct title but I you know it it seems like it's also a good way to promote like if you've done something that is established in certain niche being associated with air pear could

have a positive benefit for helping promote you as a individual yeah certainly so so like I said we we put a lot of effort into marketing you so that means we can increase your social exposure we have our own social presence so we like to tweet about our experts which is being here else come for the last couple of days interviewing a lot of the speaker's ring and sharing the

content of the talk that they specialize in as well as the things that they're passionate about and what what are experience to having pair programming and helping people and that's all content that's available online to watch so yeah we love we love developers right so we love championing them and sort of growing the whole ecosystem is the heart and you in particular I mean you came up

this idea for air pear did this come from your own passion for being able to pair did they--how did this start did this come from you were doing pairing and you were trying to find a better way to be able to reach people or show so I actually built the marketplace originally from the experience of someone needing help I've done a few startups had already been developing for

ten years yeah actually I've been developing on.net from a seven run and tell anyone so really what I was looking for was not a service where I needed to be trained as me being a beginner but I wanted to move from one technology to the other for example I was brewing web developer but when I moved into mobile I really struggled to get the mobile paradigms

and pick up a platform called titanium which is like a JavaScript framework that basically had bindings to native iOS native Android and I knew that if I had the right person at the right moment I could literally save weeks of having to figure out how to object my first fully javascript pledged application so after so much pain i just wanted to pull this together and i also have quite a

few years of consulting going in and out of contracts so without really understanding what the experience of mentoring would be like i did my first day and I was just blown away in the sense that I came out of my first session with an incredible emotional reaction yeah to imparting knowledge on to someone right and helping them to move on to the next thing that they

wanted to do to be able to knock out product that they were really passionate about so since i started ever i've done a lot of mentoring mostly around back from j s which is sort of the javascript front end that I've specialized in the last sort of three to four years and it's it's just really fun yeah when you know something inside out and you work on a day in day out and you get to

connect with someone else who is either just onboarding with that technology and they're like a sponge that they're ready to pay you which means every single minute they're online on a video chat with you that have one hundred percent focus focus and attention and then write trying to draw everything of your brain out of you without any hesitation it isn't like a normal consulting gig where

you might end up in a cubicle phone okay why am I here while I guess I'm going yes it's really no longer you're going to be engaged because it's it's it's a metered yeah so how a was just fun helping that person but a peppy it was like it's consulting is not just about knowing your code Consulting's about sharing knowledge right so it's an incredible

mechanism for you to improve yourself yeah like a contractor comes in and does something the consultant tells you why it's a happier and then being a mentor can be a great experience for some peas I could tell right so not only do we sort of capture where you come from what your story is but once you've been on our network we have recordings of you interacting and helping people I'm from

that we can really really push up your profile if ya know our great job with people so uh the wii i know we teased a little bit with the dinette developers always have done that developer for a decade i love don't have to examine and and we also cheese PHP developers but they you know it's I'm sorry we love you let me tell you we do a lot of like fantastic WordPress one yeah i was gonna

ask about you know business is it's a OS 10 only kind of thing or will this work with with somebody who wants to pear / linux or windows I mean with us yeah I mean we have a lot of our experts on linux and sometimes they leave spend tiny little bit more time setting up the drivers so they're hangouts correctly picks up the video camera are the microphone and such but as long as you

can get a google hangout weapon you can be an expert on our network no matter you know what platform you come from okay so just to wrap it up the if I'm a developer who's interested in putting my skills on the marketplace one why do so you can go to a pair calm and find the button that says apply to be an expert and from there you'll be taken to a screen where you log in with google we

use Google to connect to a google hangouts or any joke google account it takes about three minutes to connect your github stackoverflow linkedin twitter so there's very little information that you have to give us outside of the social activities you performing a lot of and right and we use that to to really identify which experts on a network or

appropriate for which requirements that are coming through so we can we can do very detailed analysis on you know have you help people with this technology for answering questions on stack of what did you contribute to this open source project that this person is asking for I so besides your social profile you really just need to put in the rate that you're looking for because it is a

marketplace and how many hours a week you'd like us to see me where is there any guidance for helping decorate or do you guys see kind of what other people are yeah I could be like well am I in my border I feel like it then in there that could be it is it is a new market yeah so at this point there is actually a lot more supply than there is demand so we would recommend at this point to put

your rate lower but besides that guidance is is very loose because we ourselves were exploring Frank what's out there so for early adopters this is a good thing and maybe look into really adapting I would say so yeah and one thing I do want to point out is because we have so many literally thousands now experts registered on a platform if you just register them and don't come back

you might not hear from us so we encourage you to follow our twitter feed where we basically post many times daily different requests that come in from all different technologies if there's anything you see that you like just read a lesson and that will give you really high chances of getting on an airplane you kind of try to clean the ticket exactly and so it's not like a push room

i'm just going to email saying out something wants you to so you like oh I need this and there's a little bit of one thing that stated stream unique about airfare and there are a couple of news three players who are fast following in our space is that we put all our emphasis and energy onto giving the expert the ultimate experience I'm part of that means we only

come to you with very specific things that match your preferences and that's both on the technologies that are requested as well as the price of the request right so we could you know flick a switch and instead email you who knows how many times a day for everything right going through our system rather we really place a lot of value on customer service and what we call even erm expert

relationship management okay whether it's always someone in between you and the system trying to find out exactly you know what you want so in that way no we don't we don't like blanket email everyone because I guess the signal versus noise ratio would be what we would find too high okay well thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me ya hear clothes on thanks love

hannity repair com yep all right thanks thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yeah cute esta com you

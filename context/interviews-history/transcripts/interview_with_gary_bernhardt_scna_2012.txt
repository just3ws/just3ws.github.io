hi I'm Mike again with you tastic I'm at SCA knop sitting down with Gary Bernhard who's created the destroy I'll destroy all software screencast series and he also just recently gave a talk here at SEMA in previous interviews I've talked I've had Gary style of presentation being called when Gary's going to get up and talk he's going to drop some knowledge on you and he has a unique way

of presenting I wanted to understand a little bit about how you approach your presentations and your speaking engagements and what what influences you yeah the the way that I actually create a talk for one thing is I think very unusual I don't I certainly don't outline and I was right usually what happens is I stand up in my apartment start pacing and just start talking for

about 30 to 45 minutes and I might stop and make single word notes on slides just making slides to a white background black text single word and after that I go through a very long refinement period but just standing up and talking creates sort of the backbone of it the pieces get shuffled but the core message is usually there and in a case where I'm present proposing a talk I'll actually

do that before the proposal so by the time you get my proposal I already know I can I can deliver a full length talk I'm happy with the content as far as how I come up with topics I have much less insight into sort of that process I just sort of come up right now sometimes I do I'll keep a running we keep a jump in my personally key it's just ideas and I'll have I'll see trends come up in it so

that's where my talk last year at SEMA came from this talk was a little more premeditated I just I wanted to focus on this idea of boundaries and values about between opt-ins but yeah it's sort of a very high level overview of all my processes because last year was expansion and contraction right excuse me yeah I just noticed that was another time another pair of topics yeah so last

year's was it was actually a series of I think seven or eight dichotomies expansion contraction capability suitability right right yeah so those were all related and then I I just tried to make a talk out of all of them found the ones that fit better together the best and then just sort of figured out how to turn that to a narrative by putting it in the right order and adding

some historical context but there's usually a core idea like that I mean the core capability and suitability was was three pairs of words ultimately the core of boundaries was was just boundaries and values the relationship between the boundary between code and other code and how that relates to a value past which mean code another code so there's always a core well Holly the value behind cross

bothers yes the value being the met the boundary itself the thing that goes between two pieces of code for them to communicate as opposed to a blocking synchronous message send and a method call so there's usually yeah there's usually a core sort of idea that's very simple and can be expressed in just a few words with your destroy all software series is that a similar methodology

that you used to come up with the topics for that screencast sort of it's a little different because this raw software our screencasts I can't I can't come up with things to say and unclick images to them that would be me doing a talk well the president practice talk every every other week which I don't think would be worth $9 month instead with a screencast I usually sit down and

just silently we'll go through it you know there will be a refactoring that's the court that I want to be the core of a screencast so I'll just do it silently a few times and if I if I feel like it's still interesting to me after doing it a couple times then I'll pull out the microphones start recording and just start doing it and I just sometimes the

the second time I do it I'm already recording and I just do it all the way through over and over again until I feel good enough about it I didn't I made I didn't make any major mistakes I didn't have to backtrack I didn't stumble over words a lot so it's similar in that I don't do upfront planning I just start doing it but the thing I'm doing is different for a talk I'm standing up and

speaking in the visual is secondary for a screencast the visual is much more prominent much more important and I actually started to start with the visual work being done first and then figure out what to say I have to ask that do you do the art clear your hesitations or the design by design yeah I do I do all that myself I'm not a good designer at least I don't think I am but

I know how to get a color scheme on the internet I know how to make things either line up or not line up okay in conspicuous ways and and those are sort of my core the core things but maybe it's the simplicity of um and heavier clean the gears of the sense of the design yeah I mean it's a it's one of the things I mean preparing talks has been the mechanism by which I've become

much better at design and the main thing I had to learn is that it's very simple like there I have a lot of slides where it'll be I did a lightning talk today where I showed some things about high design slides and a slide might be for words right but I don't just put four words in the middle of the screen with its black on white the color choice matters they're probably probably at

least one of those words is going to be a different color for some reason a semantic reason okay and they're not just going to be in a line they're gonna be in some kind of you know there's gonna be some kind of spatial relationship it keeps people interested in the content did you look at that what what influenced that or is it just tasting the main the point at which I

started doing it was I read a blog post by Zack Holman who's a github I forget the name of the post but if you google for Zach Coleman's loneliness yeah you'll add a link and then one of the big things he said was line things up or don't want things up and that is sort of the core of what I do it's really simple okay big fonts not a lot of stuff on a slide line things up

or don't mind things up okay yeah some simple guidelines yeah on with the the short soft work you have taken you I remember when he came to achieve and to keep trust you were talking about you I think we're just at the point of launching or preparing to launch where you have just a few that was last yeah that's that summer so yeah couple months now yeah and and you were open to

suggestions and you and you did apply some of those and I thought that was a very impressive that it wasn't they I'm gonna create this thing and I and I I know it's in I'm just gonna push it out the way I see fit you were open to the feedback and a few years on watching the interactions you have I just wonder is that something that's been a double-edged sword with

interacting with the community as far as this raw softer out say no I get a fair bit of email to the support address you know a few emails a day not a huge amount but enough thing I have to check it regularly and I don't I don't know that I've ever gotten a question I thought was just a dumb question yeah I'll call it dumb dumb question I really think it's dumb but no people people are

very deeply engaged and the questions they ask are usually it's very deep meaningful questions like they've really understood what I was trying to say that is not true in general on Twitter where people are gonna people may lack context about me they might have followed me because they saw me do some silly four-minute lightning talk and they laugh the context for my relationship

software and so that color's your perception of what a person either believes or is saying so they're very different worlds the destroy all software subscribers have a lot of context for what I think about programming and they very rarely misattribute ideas to me or misunderstand what I'm saying so that's for a different story on Twitter

different story yeah on Twitter it's much more frustrating much more frustrating for me because people will people will explain very basic computer science talk concepts to me for example and I'm like I know you know I know that already I don't need that explain to me and it's very frustrating when 20 people explain to you what like some basic data

structure is or something yeah at least for me I'm very frustrated but now I feel sort of attacked I feel it it feels like people are saying calling me stupid even though I know it's happening the emotional response I have is sort of defensive like I'm being attacked okay yeah so it's it because it's I've just kind of seen her before we started the interview that it's a lossy it's a

very lossy on Twitter I should say it's a very lossy medium that sometimes it's even a written word in long one is hard to convey intent that's why even I treated at a joke back at you today and I'm like I don't know how this is going to be received you know I I tried that couch it as as much as I could admit this is a joke in a in and that but some people are very literal and they see a

question they're like all that Wow I'm surprised that you didn't know that so but is that something that's having become a look becoming a success a success sometimes can be a double-edged sword in and that's really what I was gonna go going with with the the SHA software is you you become more known and more having more people being aware of you and in its the DEM i fame of our

profession it's you've started to progress beyond just being one of the people in the crowd to being something that is a focal point and that people start to you know kind of like with Uncle Bob he's he's personally people come to him you know for better or for worse and it's not that it's not a sudden him it's it's what people's motivations are for going

into that person now are they going because that person's famous or because they've seen some kind of value from what that person had to say right that's an interesting dichotomy you raise because in the early days it's got to be the latter right it's got to be they're going to that person because they said something that they found useful but when you're when you become

properly famous and I wouldn't consider myself properly famous relative to our industry in it but once you become well-known enough people people come to you because of your name or they might dislike they might assume that you're wrong because your name there's some people who are who view the idea who view anyone who who is who has notoriety as either doing it extracting money from

people by unfair means or detached from reality there there are a lot of people who think that some of the core agile guys just don't program which is not true those guys are all tapping they all hack all the time so it and I've had a little bit of that certainly not as much as you know people but but that is also that it's been very frustrating for me and I'm actually I'm planning on

reducing my public visibility for exactly this reason I don't want to I don't want to turn into more of a curmudgeon than I am naturally because I feel sort of beaten down yeah I and I wonder if that's I mean I do I don't have the opportunity to ask maybe someday I will but what happened with why is that rahi overall most people have very positive but I have to wonder

what his actual interactions with we work in warth were people was there enough negative coming at him that it ultimately drove him away aye aye sir Tinley no people in the Ruby community prominent people and and more than one of them who think that that is exactly what happened if you go back to some of wise posts and read the comments I mean the posts are always self

contained I read the comments where he's interacting with people he has a very sort of he has a sort of sarcastic wit that he's that he's speaking in and I think that I mean if I were Y watching me say this I would be so mad at myself but I think it to some extent he's sort of you who sort of might have been masking this discontent behind behind his very dry speaking so I don't know I

don't want to guess it was my autumn wise head poor guy probably just wants us to never say yeah but it's it's relevant to this conversation no you're looking at somebody who's and and this one thing is talking to many of the people here that are speakers are prolific speakers or authors or even free and open source citing I find you who creates a code in for Java sometimes

people are just like do this you know like you like he owes them something oh you know and that it's it's the same thing for speakers and for authors that they assume but because you've created this thing right here somehow obligated and I mean there's there's a I think there is a social contract but some people take it too far yeah

to relate this back to my destroy all software interactions versus just public Twitter interactions it is very rare for destroy all software subscriber to demand anything from right there are a couple things that people seem to want like an iTunes feed which I will do something yes but as far as sort of demanding me demanding for me to do anything for them very rare on public

Twitter people tweet like tweet me to adjust up to 100 lines of code including specs and be like what's wrong with this why is why is this good or not I'm just late I can't read them deeply analyzed a hundred lines of code at a whim you know it'll take me half an hour and I don't take the time to do that yeah so it puts you in the very unfortunate

position of having to tell someone no I'm not going to help you with that and and they may not realize the level of demand that's on you right yeah so yeah as you can tell I have lots of feelings about this probably to mind a few years ago there was it's not so much anymore but there was a very very very popular ASP pretty asp.net website called for guys from rolla and one of

the guys on there he would get so many questions that finally he would just respond with a link to a page that explained how to hire him so if you ask him a question he said I'm you know I have the website you can look at it it has lots of answers on there but if you need some personal hello my rate is $75 an hour and it's a minimum of an hour yeah whatever this is flat top and it

was also strictly for answering questions so we had I hear this question answer out of a husband even with ab DS Scribbins you can hire him how to hire Abdi you know maybe that might be a way to turn these random quark Wesson - well a few extra bucks yeah I mean there's always that I don't think I've ever o'clock responded to one of these requests in that way and that's

partly because I don't want to seem likely sure you know there's there there are many kinds of jerk and I don't ever want to be the kind of it seem like the kind of jerk who's trying to take money from you but I will say I was aware of this guy's context when he was getting thousands of requests and I probably would just stop using Twitter yes honestly but I lost my grandfather

so so right the other thing is I don't want to be doing that I don't want to spend my day answering the same questions I've answered before I don't want to analyze code for the same mistakes that I've found before right I want to be figuring out how to do how to do new things that are genuinely interesting I mean it's not that I think that doing those other things is bad

it's just that I get I get bored very quickly and I don't want to be doing repetitive work so so unfortunately it's not a solution for me and that's why I don't think and I just just curious you had said that you had run a user group before he had run a Python group in Cleveland yeah I didn't start it I just ran it okay but here have you done much speaking or engagement with user groups

really actually I mean I did a few talks there the first talks I ever did were there long before I ever get a conference talk I've done a couple in Seattle mostly short ones I don't think I've ever done a full length talk at a user group after I started speaking at conferences for the first time which was oh hey so it kind of kind of switched completely over okay because we were

having a brief conversation and you alluded to having an opinion yeah and I'm not exactly sure how to couch the question so I'll just bluntly come on say yeah what was your thoughts that you were thinking of well so my opinion about user groups is not is not why I stopped speaking at them so that there's two pieces to this one is that doing a talk like that when I get here is

extremely expensive in time for me it's probably nowadays it's maybe 20 to 30 hours of prep when I started doing high-quality columns like this was more like 40 60 hours in prep it was a lot of work and I didn't want to be doing that to give it to an audience of 20 people because it's just there is I mean doing a talking at CNN has a monetary about it very it's how I make my living

indirectly through destroyer software and and unfortunately that is an aspect there's also just you know you don't want to do a ton of work to reach a very small audience you want to reach the spigen audience as you can the other side is that I've been to a lot of user groups I ran a user group for a year and I think that they that they're they're isolated nature has some negative

effects most notably you can get into this this weird situation where the user group forms a thought bubble in and of itself or certain ideas become prominent and they're reinforced through people talking to each other in casual conversation at the user group and through presentation of these ideas I think this happened to a small extent in in the Ruby community when the the

Cleveland Ruby community in particular a very small group of which I was an early and frequent member we we just we got into certain ideas that turned that I in retrospect I think that we we weren't validating them against the outside world we just sort of got excited about them internally and they were the right thing and we didn't really think so it was you you seemed we described it was

the insulin bubble of and not enough cross-pollination sure because that's it's interesting as some of the conversations I've had over the last couple days have focused on the idea of getting and beyond your your small group and then it sounds like they were coming at the same problem that it was you don't want to just become a a I can't think of the word but you don't want to

just become a hive mind where you everybody just agrees and nods at each other and says yes yes we're all so smart but goes out to different group so I do you think maybe the answer to avoiding that insular group is spreading out and going to different groups and try and go to the closure to go to the die maker go to see something that you've not done

before right it could be I mean I can't my knowledge is limited to my own experience so I can't I can't I don't want to speculate too much I think that could probably help but they're always going to be things are specific to a group like in 2000 what did we start that group Oh probably we started the ruby group in Cleveland and in 2007 in Cleveland

yeah the ruby group Python group and then a whole bunch of more traditional like Java C sharp kind of things right there was very little counterpoint to Ruby because python is not a cultural counterpoint well it's a very different culture to Ruby but but the things you talk about in Ruby have no analog usually in the Python community so there's very little there's no counter

point to r-spec you know the counterpoint is X unit in Python basically so that may be better now it depends on where you live etc etc but I could certainly I could certainly see it helping well so did Python has that the documents of the doc test doc toss yeah I mean but it's just a very different but that's one of the things I think would be healthy if ruby developer who's

enamored with the spec went to a Python group and learn about doc tests and so I think that's actually wonderful everyone programmers should learn about doc tests for sure right and but it's just a different way of thinking and that's I think that's ultimately what I've kind of inferred from the conversations I've had over the last several days is or less of all interviews has spent those

cross-pollination and it seems to fit in with what you described is becoming too much of a closed group closed system and not getting exposed to those new idea see well that's really different than the way we do it right yeah it's--that's-- it's certainly very valuable to do that every opportunity well maybe not every opportunity there's about there's value to focusing down so

yeah but you need to come up for sure okay well thank you very much for taking the time to stop me appreciate it no problem

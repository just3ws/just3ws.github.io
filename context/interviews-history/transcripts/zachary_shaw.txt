user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with you tastic I'm at se na 2013 now sitting down with Zach shot who runs the Boston sophomore craftsmanship group Zach thinks we're

taking the time to sit down with me we've talked before but uh it's been a while since we've been able to catch up how are you doing and how's the shuffle craftsmanship in Boston it's going i'm doing good and uh the group's doing great we just had our three-year anniversary Wow three years yeah so three years once a month and it's you know kind of going steady and great um

let's see new things that have happened yes I spent some time thinking about kind of what I always had a particular specific philosophy of like the sort of events that were in and out and and I was thinking you know in the last year or so about bringing more people into facilitate because I've been doing I've been doing all the facilitation for the last three years primarily and sometimes

I have other things to do right her I don't have an idea um and also to give other people experience because I was like it's important to me to you know I get so much value I realized I was like oh boy I'm like getting good at this like right you know like a building up my skillet like facilitating these things like that's something I could you know spread around but three years is a

long time to do something over and over and over again especially with life events that come up and things like that yeah so so it's thinking about bringing other people in and so I started you know at the end of our meetings asking folks like hey who wants to do a session people get like I wanna do something and I'd be like what do you want to do and they say some topic and I'd be like that

doesn't fit you know if someone would say something I'd be like that does fit the house and I was like wow like there's some criteria I have that nobody else knows about that i think is important and so i was like i have to nail that a little better you know so i started doing some work kind of thinking about that and I was like I was like I need a mission right any a mission

statement and so I realized that you know but the things that people were saying that fitted and fit out and didn't fit in we're about practice and so the mission and improvement you know like I mean I think improvements kind of a given you know soccer crashing ship we're trying to get better raise the bar right that's the theme of this conference I feel like this year so the

mission statement i came up with frame for people who wanted to propose things was improvement through practice that's that's the mission statement for Boston support current craftsmanship yeah and it sounds like that was a really important growth for you to realize that you had these ideas in your head but you weren't may be communicating them as well as it felt like it did it

definitely felt like that and so it was like a really important turning point for me and and and i think you know i've gotten a little bit of feed positive feedback I've hurt people kind of mention the mission statement and like and it's I think it's like a really good framing I know like why you know right so that's like a bit of a big question I've been asking hey so is that affected

new members may be done having a better understanding what to expect by coming to ruben say oh yeah that is a value proposition i would want to spend my afternoon evening doing i don't i don't know for a fact i do it has definitely helped frame the sessions that we're doing and maybe yeah like it must give context it is context for the sessions so you know we had someone new I've had

a sort of new present and and it was so much easier for me to explain what the expectations were because I did the work and there was easier for them to accept it because they had seen a couple sessions and I kind of knew who knew what the annuity the deal wants yeah exactly so can you describe again how your meeting is sorry for how quickly you you did lots of an interactive

sessions right yeah it's a hundred percent interactive there's no talking heads I that doesn't excite me don't think of it cites the members who have shown up the last three years because they like the interactive stuff but yeah it's all interactions so we do we'll have a discussion or we'll do some hands-on coding or we'll do some other kind of hands-on exercise you know it

could be just like we did a modeling exercise there was no code involved it was just like here's a problem come up with different models that make solve it lots of lots of circles and arrows lots of circles and arrows sometimes it's good just to step away from the keyboard and just think about the shape of a problem yeah I think there's a lot more to being a good craftsman than the

keyboard right and as far as the membership hesita is it expanded contracted have you gone through any cycles that you work all over the last 23 years um it's been growing in the last I'd say three months I've noticed a significant growth and so is that sense the mission statement well I think the mission statement is about a year Oh game at this point or maybe it's nine

months old but it's I you know I think a couple folks have kind of like switched jobs and they've done a good job of reaching out to people at their new companies and bringing them in that I think is like promotion all right I mean it's like marketing that's what's kind of raised this membership but organic this isn't that you're you're paying for it said somebody tells somebody yes let

me bring somebody yeah so there's like a handful of people who could have grown more interested you know being more involved they've brought more people all right are you looking at diversifying into any are you is Boston some for Katzman ship involved with any of the local events were mostly focused on on your mom meetings where we're not really involved

in too many of the other user groups we have to event there's this officer forecasters a group and then out of that there is a code and cocktails event which Mark Simpson is no longer in Boston created and so that's kind of it's interesting that it's a different slice of people right but it's out of the same kind of its out of the same group of people just you know a little

aside about Boston excuse me about the encoding cocktails and it's it's something it's always interesting to see a community grow past its founder to see you the fonner other steps away or moves or whatever happens but the community once it's established and fostered and properly nurtured to a certain point can become self-sustaining self-propagating entity yeah in that it can live beyond

so it's kind of like if you if you work hard enough it's just like raising a kid or a company you work hard enough eventually it just kind of can go yeah I think so and is that where you feel like not that you're looking to step away but that you're trying to get it Boston safa craftsmanship to a point where it can kind of maybe operate without you having to push the buttons every every month

yeah I'm definitely thinking about that yes yeah is it has it been hard and I mean have they had there been days where your question about whether or not you want to keep it keep it going just because no no i don't but that's not like a concern i like it so much it's like you know it's like a really smart interested group of people and really fun atmosphere so i don't want to stop

oh no like i'm not i'm not i don't i'm not like sick of it or anything like that you know it's a I think it's like I want to help people get better and one of the ways to help people get better is to help them become better facilitators in leaders and so I want to give some of that opportunity that I could afford it would entice yeah yeah other people you know it's well I mean it might be fun to

be able to go to a session and just learn chase it is yeah cuz I don't I haven't got that opportunity but you don't have to go and be like all is the food ready you know did Debra show up is there somebody locked out yeah not that that happened to giving Bernhardt I mean at a conference yeah something got locked out yeah for the talk um so you know it seems like the group is is

growing and you're growing with it and that's that's really exciting to hear that somebody who's started a community is still three years on so excited enthusiastic about what they're doing and trying to figure out new ways to even approach yeah it's it feels great you know I think in the last four months I will only facilitate it one session yeah so let's be like really cool yeah

you need to go and just kind of enjoy what you what you started yeah reap what you sow they believe what I saw yeah I've um I've started I try and keep like my expectations of the facilitators low right which is like I think fun for everybody it was interesting leg but so I did this session on trampolining like I didn't know anything about trampolining goes like work no one no

here knows anything about trampolining I'm gonna act like I know what you're talking about all right there's four different contexts but i'm not sure the context you're speaking up so i was thinking that trampolining as a way as a technique in the first heard about enclosure analysis new there's this function trampoline and i didn't understand it and I understand why it

was important and nobody in the group did it I was like all right here's a programming concept yeah let's family let's figure it out so I like set up the session it's like all of a sudden it like exploded into like you know um tail recursion optimization and I was like preparing all stuff and I was like I don't really know about this stuff and like I don't know how well prepared to

him but I came in I was like I was like this is all gonna be confusing yeah like this is gonna be to be bigger than I expected yeah but it was it was cool because I was like we're gonna figure it out together yeah like I will have all this material like I think you know we can do these things and like it was fun because it was like my preparation was so like half-baked but it like somehow

it like engaged everybody like immensely like that was the feedback astronauts like how did this thing go like I was like really a prepared in there like it was awesome that you were unprepared yeah like we all had to work hard and be engaged was like all right that's weird strategy so it was that was that part of what made you realize that maybe it was a little bit you're holding it a little

bit too close and that letting people be a little bit more active and participant not just that they do the activity but actually a part of the unknown mmm wait what's your question well that they got to be part of the creation of the content for the presentation that it that instead of coming in with a bait here's what we're going to do here's a concept and you already know it back to

front you come in and it's like here's kind of an open-ended thing let's do this together and then now they feel like they can come in in an own part of the problem I think it helped me frame the expectations for other people who are going to present like that's kind of what I've been evolving like what are the expectations like if you came in and we're going to facilitate the thing at

buses after craftsmanship what are the expectations on you so like my thoughts on that have like been growing more sophisticated and so you know I think it was kind of like an aha for me then that was like okay you know you don't need to be fully prepared and that's kind of awesome because it lowers the expectations you know because I think some people were

like I don't want to present because I'm intimidated by the amount of work and the expectations like you have to like really run a great session you know and it's like no you don't have to have be so prepared because we'll all help you yeah see it's not the j to have all the answers but you have to have a plan yeah you have to have a plan and and like like don't worry about how hard it is to

prepare like just spend you know you know six to ten hours you know like if you can do that then like cool like we'll all support you in you know helping you run the session basically yeah because it's a point you have to have that first what's not about the first no it's just like it's that you the expectation of the group is that it doesn't need to be fleshed out because

we're gonna have a great time and we're going to explore some concept no matter what as long as you're able to like give us a framing like a general framing it doesn't have to be fleshed out it's not like you're not the guy who has all the answers you know you're just the person who is helping us with the conversation alone right well thank you very much I think in the times of doubt me free

welcome it's a Boston some for craftsmanship is I'm meet up I don't know oh yeah google groups google curves just Google Boston software craftsmanship group and your friend alright great day very much cool thanks Peck all right user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of

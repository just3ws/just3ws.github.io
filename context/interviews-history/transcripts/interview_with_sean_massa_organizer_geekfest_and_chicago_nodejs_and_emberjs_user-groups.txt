I hi it's Mike resume desk and he organic group on thanks to the efforts of Sean massa who I'm interviewing right now sean is a organizer extraordinary he's been organizing the geek fest in Chicago and in Seattle Chicago no Jay ask you you founded that right and then the Ember Jas and is also an open source developer giving the test IAM framework

for node.js testing a very very busy person with first thing you're not just for taking the time to speak of me but for helping coordinate your dinner clothes and now thank you very much for taking offense to be there uh so let's just start you're involved in in a bunch of of groups will just pick one that semi-random us in the node.js because i think that was the first one to use

environment with um let's start there how what what led you to you and we had talked before about no chance but let's go back and try to revisit what got you interested enough and no jst start the user group sure this was back in i think it was note about 40 da6 it was pretty early and I always really liked JavaScript it's always been interested in it I did a lot of jQuery 12 a lot of

people do but I was also looking for how to structure things better but because i like to javascript so much using it on the server with something I've wanted to do for a long time so I actually played with like iron GS which is the dinette stuff that's where they died I tried getting like the rhino and like the other server side JavaScript fair wants to work out so then aptana I think there

was saying it there you know it sounds familiar to those we have time ago but then when no one came out it just seemed to make so much sense like how the Creator pitched it how it actually ended up working everything being a sink at a really basic level and it just sort of clicked so I really wanted to start working with it I want to talk to other people who are working with it and so

friend of mine and I founded the group and it was back at started a hedgehog it back in the day come on and we just had like a dozen people showed for the first several months but over time is dirty cookie jar kind of grew as snow Jess Lana Berkshire I mean what you're worth thousand right now correct yeah over like 1100 members now wow so you went from just say let's

talk about this and have a few dozen people hands off and you said it it was inside that level for a while yeah it's a it took a little bit of time to get some traction but then when I started a group on the group needed a new host for the venue so why not let's just have it here and I think that gave it a little bit more they're a little more the third year yeah but in a lot of elimination

off that's what that's it exactly and then we also have loved up our space to grow so I did a little bit more that were to try and get people to come in from then yeah it's just been steadily progressing because i actually just stick on that for a second date and something that talked about with people running user groups is that it takes sometimes it takes time yeah shakes or

time for people just to learn about you yeah and the goal isn't necessarily to have the biggest group ever i just want to have people come together have a chat about if that's five people that's still awesome yeah yeah so I you run no chance for a while how next comes geek fest on how did you end up getting roped into that geek fest was being run here before I took it over and it was run back at a

tebow back in 2007 and it started gate press just a little back on is uh was a organ up in internal mini group at optima the consulting firm here in Chicago that one up team are got acquired my group on lived on at Groupon yeah so I was already being run for a while but the people who are running it didn't want to put the time like running a user cortex it's not for this you know

and so they don't want to do it anymore so looking for some while since I had experienced I religious and geekfest was really interesting to me because it's really tech agnostic and it even tries to dip into not only like the soft skills and the interpersonal communication and issues i came up with that that still apply to our work but it's in specific

to technology but also preparing people for conference talks alright you practice of us look I like to head this whole range we just wanted to help he did announce today in the gym a project to help people that are coming in antitrust yes it's perfect offices yes so it's called the geek us speaker feedback program it's very eloquent yes I like names that make sense he crashed

speaker feedback feedback okay so when you sign up to speak it geek fest you just let me know that you want to be part of the feedback and we have five right now speakers who work at Groupon who have offered their time to make sure that they attend your talk or watch it on our intern on livestream and then provide that feedback to you that's just really constructive nice like nothing

again no one's going to try to tear you down like the goal is to make your presentation better when you do take it to a conference or I did even just a different venue and the goal is that we give that back to you is in 24 hours of your actual talk okay yeah nothing like show you've only you've only practiced in front of your cats keep it at your candle no no and that's a little

building up yeah and then I'll compile from the X different people in route to placate some stuff so you just get this simplest of things to just look at maybe you do change it maybe you don't but just something to consider and it's all from people who are veteran speakers and conferences and meet ups and stuff like that okay so he trusts you know started here in Chicago now maturely or keep

trust ya yes what so that we just announced yesterday we're basically spreading geekfest outside of Chicago so it's the same format same idea we'll also be doing the speaker feedback program there for anyone who wants to do that but it's just a way like anywhere we have a groupon office we want to goodbye this it seems like a really great general purpose speed up and I'm

as a tech night Gnostic you want it to be a place where people want to go to practice because because of the feedback program because of the audience that we usually draw just be nice to provide that to community as a freebie optional service and I'd just be clear the blue button I keep trust it's good ranking for us but it's not internal only people it's on me dawg yes you can sign up to

210 meetings it's not just pulling from Ron yes if you want to go to either one you just search for it on Vito calm and you'll find it okay and now to get another day I don't know how you have time with it because I know you also have a kid too um you are involved with the the chicago number jail so at least you have a seat today s only sure you've stuck with stuff that ends with that

Jael yes I do like jobs so um how did you get milk or whipped into that one with that one Shrek started the group and believe and they had a couple of meetings in a couple different places and like I recognized the groupon yeah I mean we like hosting meetups it's a central place that we both work here I could be that easy to just go downstairs on the sign for the video rather than

finding new venues and what I'd every mom so I approached him about trying to get here he said that that was a great idea and then I use a lot of the work to try and get it approved get our internal budget set up for it and get everything worked out so that we could have it here actually I have a blog post about that adventure which was pretty interesting and then we started going on so we had

the first one here a couple months ago we're trying to get into the key that's kind of silly to a group but the next one's going to be scheduled alone in the next week or so so okay go on um sorry you know you gone back to that first you know I can't absorb a usergroup um do you feel like you've learned a lot about what user groups are and and what goes into them and has that changed your

relationship with interacting with community in general yeah I feel like I've learned a ton okay I now help run more helped run three different look for different readouts I just lost track so you can't really do that it not learn something about the experience I'm trying to make it easier at least within the groupon office are building as pretty tight security which is both good

in bed so we trying to streamline some of that but yeah for the most part just reaching out to peoples and finding new members is sort of the hardest part because like you can tweet all day and the people will start ignore you because you just try to aim too much I don't know anything left but I think the trick is to all it's not a trick but the key is to really get your attendees engaged

so I've been trying to find more ways to do things that aren't just lecture style presentations more workshops abour people really like lightning talks give you a lot of different things and then you can go find that specific person kind of tunnels get it Punk yeah exactly so we're having success with those but doing something more involved like workshops takes a lot of work so I'm

trying to figure out the best way to handle that balance because running these at all is a lot of work oh yes so we're in it just came to close it up you are also working in an open source project so I think you were busy enough yes test him you were you to this the idea for custom come out of work or take amount of interactions and user groups or did testing the idea for that

compliment what is testament sure so Tess team itself is a it's a synchronous API that binds to selenium webdriver so that you can write tests in JavaScript that controller browser okay so you're into in tests or integration tests from whatever you call them like the browser being tests in the rails where all this would be a real Heisman for number for example and I created it out of

frustrations of meeting something at work like we did this big transition over to node for like the whole front end piece of architecture anything that deserves hTML is written a note pretty much for all groupon com so we would need it some way I feel really big into testing and we needed some way to test these and we didn't really feel right to put on cucumber or not I really like to

do Comber anyway so they wanted something else so I thought it'd be great if we had something that was in JavaScript could be in the same repository can look like your other tests so I looked around for a lot of different options there's zombie which is fast and cool but it's not really that close to a real browser just tries really hard to emulate one we did some

things based on Casper for a while and that was good because they had this like what kid back is it was least closer to a real browser but it ended up being a little bit more trouble than it was worth so I never wanted to a school that's my goal like through all software development is right as little as possible use what other people have done or contribute back to what other people

don't were able to find that blank spot but yeah this thing didn't really exist now there are a couple of things similar but at the time that i started this publicity really exist in any conceivable way and the core of it is synchronous bindings till of selenium webdriver the currents will find the current examples were all asynchronous bindings which using JavaScript

asynchronous that makes sense what's the problem the problem is that your integration tests just they're nested comex after you click the button then come back and do this and then but really just it just went in and then yes and yeah there are ways to manage that you can use promises or something else but I didn't care like I don't want that I don't want to manage it yeah it

shouldn't be a synchronous like I never want to click this and then do this and then when that's done do this and that Sun do this it's always a series of steps like fill out this form then click this like maybe you want to fill out multiple form elements amounts to try to speed things up but that's like a scenario i can think of so i wanted something secret

I wrote synchronous webdriver bindings in JavaScript based on node and that was actually not too difficult those documentation was all there from the selenium project they have this jason wire part protocol that lets you interact with it so that's all set up as a separate project if you want to use it for something else test team itself wraps that with mocha sort of higher

level API in some places on top of it so that you can just write mocha tests with your ETD syntax or whatever and then you can interact with a browser in the synchronous way so you say like browser click and you test it a CSS selector or bastard a key element and SES selector that you can operate on that went by clicking it or getting its value or whatever it is and it's been really

great we have 440 some teams like different teams here using it so it's really it's actually being tested yes it's testing relevance is there's its inception of toddlers intestines yeah but okay so yeah this this product you created have you also used I going to the user groups have gotten feedback to them and ten people yeah we've talked about her that Chicago no Jess pocket

all seems pretty psyched about it I it is open source I gets issues and sometimes for requests from people outside a groupon which is awesome great well thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me yeah sure thanks again for helping already nicest my pleasure that's what does organized it's true user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great

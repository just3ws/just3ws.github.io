hi i'm mike hall with you tastic I'm standing here with Angelique Martin from a flight she is certainly you've worked with the XP universe and the where the XP agile universe one was rebranded because edgell was the thing but now you're working with SEMA software craftsmanship North America it's a conference that spend what is our fourth year yes okay that fourth here can you

tell me a little bit about se na LCA so s DNA stands for software craftsmanship in North America it's organized right here in Chicago it will be held November ninth and tenth look at the aon center it's a two-day conference will have about 14 speakers including robert martin currie foil and many other names yeah they go right now remember the roster right now yeah all right so good

oh look there's two Sarah Sarah elements are great ah Leong cursing I won't be able to remember Brian Merrick that I can quote and I can't think of the other one but that's all what's your feeling I you know people can go to the site and see all us all to see all of that information but can you tell me a little bit about what is a cna so s DNA is a conference that aims at gathering people

that care about their craft they care about improving themselves they care about contributing to the community and meeting with their peers and hopefully exchanging and teaching each other okay and it this is what the fort you said the fourth year or something and traditionally this was something that you shared responsive a flight shared responsibilities with teva for

your kind of handing it off back and forth but how did now this year fortunately this year that I'm tivo was acquired was an eighth light year so we're good this year but tonight well Groupon Groupon engineering was still very involved in the planning of a flight this year as a matter of fact they helped considerably to secure the program so they there's there still a

main sponsor and there's a very annoyed okay that's good uh the year before when eighth light was in charge of it you did this kind of um you want you know one of the things I liked was you want beyond just the day-to-day like most conferences seem to be okay we have the conference we had the sessions we're gonna make me have an after party but it's usually local you know or right

inside of the facility where you organize like a field trip right on just get any feedback from helping people uh well I got some really positive feedback the idea behind this was to take you know to have a instead of a banquet where you would get a DJ and gigs real girls end up Indian yeah you are going to take people out into buses so that they could network have a chance to

discuss the topics that the speaker have rushed on that day for instance and celebrated different areas of Chicago yea though that was fun things is up from people that had spoke with me from out of town they were kind of saying that it was it was they were excited it was a chance to go and see things they might not have known to go see because I remember that this past year's s you

need some of the people were kind of from out of town they were kind of flowering that's that's one of the hard things were introverts sometimes weeks i'll just go back to our hotel room in hack or stay local or not explore correct so we'll see the hotel room and the conference yeah yeah you know so i mean the other thing was this you your you were in the city one year and then

you're out near the airport was there any logistical things that made it more difficult being in the city or or being outside of the city I think that's primarily from the fact that one year you know we used to alternate aviva would organize and then the next generation is right and at the term in flight mostly located in the suburbs so we had

decided and you know for cost reasons as well to take the conference outside of the city it it was the very first year that it was going to be a two-day conference people so to minimize the risk we decided to take it out of the city and who did it by the airport with a connection to the city within the parking garage like the hotel yeah so it was easy to give out there okay but it

but cost was one of the big things you were saying it's yeah she put events together you know that you don't do this for the money right right right yeah but there's still a lot of money to change his hands but mostly it's outgoing okay um well thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me and looking forward a cna okay thank you

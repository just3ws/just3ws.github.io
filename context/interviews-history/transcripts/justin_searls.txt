hi it's Mike Young with you tastic here at SCA now I'm sitting down with Justin Searles co-founder of test double I justin is speaks in a lot of conferences and talks about testing but what most talking about today is you want this very interesting article not that long ago about single purpose single focus user groups and communities are kind of a dead end that the future is really in

general purpose can you describe a little bit about what you months by then arbic well there's two major points one is that obviously looking if you're watching this you're probably familiar with user groups in most communities and most locales the users are divided up by the either the server side stack frame works of people use or the languages that people predominantly identify as

I'm a ruby developer I'm a.net developer I'm a c-sharp developer and a Java developer I'm an iphone developer and so I go or a JavaScript developer and I grandma right so you know Cole I live in Columbus or in columbus we have c-bus jsb of Columbus would be Brigade we've got i'm sure we got a bad neck group that i don't fit in we've got an NS coder knife for cocoa and right dr.

tiller developers and 10 apps and rather I think it's a poor abstraction so if you're a developer you're familiar with designing abstractions that model something in a way that is I going to you know maximize reuse or just help us communicate efficiently and I think it's a poor abstraction because regardless of what language you're writing your probably solving the same kind of

problem very frequently and maybe the tools change a little bit some tax changes but but but why why redundantly have the same talk or the same solution broached in all those different dialects when we can simply come together as one group and either focus on just find any way to slice it like one way to slice it might be by problem right so like we build web

applications or art that can embedded hardware so problem domains not specifically I write down that apps because even then that's that's too vague it's right you might for the mobile do you rightful so that identifies tribes not even know any sort of like specific passion or interest that people might have that's one big piece the other is that life changes and

and some of these groups have actually kind of evolved beyond themselves we're like I go to a ruby user group and I see so many people talking about you know maybe they diverge some people are really into Erlang and other languages at this point and other people are all about front-end development so there's lots of talks about you know CoffeeScript and Joshua testing and

stuff like that all in the ostensibly Ruby user group um because it's really easy to start up a new one and and because typically like it's easy to get the word out with Twitter now as opposed to traditional means i'm all for killing user groups right like like let's let's spin one up like for him since i talked in my talk today a lot about the growing after drawing to software guided by

justice that's a fantastic book but it's a very meaty dense book and I've been toying with the idea for a couple years now just doing like a nine-part lecture series right and how that be a user group and look and feel and me just like a user group put that map it will end and everyone will go and then do something else it'll free up one of the nights

berger to to emerge so it's more life count I i would say more like a training course though note that would feel more like we're going to do a study group that's has all right yeah study group is a good word for he's that one too I mean like not not to say that that's what I think they should be but if we relax this assumption that a user groups purpose in life is to be a

self-perpetuating organization we can experiment and try new things and even if we presume the conclusion we know that things are going to know eventually end we can just experiment with different styles that are appropriate to what we hope to accomplish with that group how how in that case though do you reach out to people and maintain a continuity one of the aspects of user

community is the word community right if it's just a short little thing how do you maintain a continuity well one of the things I've observed in Columbus and it might be a function of the size Columbus is like a perfectly sized city because of the people this is two and a half million people the metro area but of the people who are engaged in the software industry enough to like show up

to some place after work right it's the same you know a couple hundred folks who either go to lots of different user groups or have one home base that they go to and we had these silos where you know picking random name on a hat there's a guy named Greg Malcolm in Columbus who I don't think I've ever gone to a user group in Columbus where he wasn't there right but he goes to all

of them and he is the glue that everyone happens to know across all these disparate communities and so it's a really inefficient communication mechanism but it exists I would much rather than have the acai lowes just have a technology that there's these two hundred people and we all kind of sort of know each other yeah and get together for big social outings just to enter

intermingle and let me let the stuff emerge so you don't think that having a specific group is what keeps people together but these are people already income yeah 22 gathering so as long as there's events these are very fun each other right as long as there's a local conference or anything to do like we i badgered jason long at github to you a

drink up right because i wanted to meet more designers right you know my particular circle i don't see designers very often so I said hey Jason let's do another Columbus drink up intentionally invite designers and then of course all the developers will come and it was a big wonderful thing and we got to meet lots of people across these you know party lines of soap so I github which is

basically if they blank there would there be 40 developers there oh it's free alcohol haha well that sounds sound like to that hasn't heard yeah but when the point is that in order you were able to take something where developers will already pay attention to this one aspect of all aspects in the community go to there and by having that's one focal point pull in another community they

were able to connect to communities don't absolutely and get some nice cross-pollination nothing and that's why I think that like I think in the blog post and money said this that language oriented or length like organizing user groups body language can be very harmful because when it stagnates people become less engaged so you get these people who start off as being highly engaged

individuals then they go to one or two user groups for 10 15 20 years there's a lot of Java use herbs now they've been around forever right and once that gets stale the person's you know even if they keep going they're sort of like just it's another mechanical thing to do and there's like a lot less you know interesting cross pollination and infusion of new ideas it's like it's

like an anachronism it's like the you know like a witch got like a Shriners club meeting or something like that or it's like this like secret society it's love jabbers right there any people who had something in common 20 years ago and then just sort of like came to coalesce into like a small little group of you know people who know each other well on your exam and there's nothing

wrong with that but I would much rather spend the time that I spend after work in a in a forum that I'm going to either be able to share a lot at a really high bang for buck you know frequency or learn a lot you know from a lot of different people all the ones so it sounds like there's kind of some different patterns one is the long-lived closely knit tight community and then

there's the more dynamic hey let's get together and just share and learn and you know if you come thats cool if you don't come that's cool but we're going to share neat stuff yeah a little bit less tight-knit maybe smaller friendships inside of that community but a little bit more high energy and there's no one right way of meeting like I think that having big mixer kind of

events is great to kind of just you know stoke the coals and get people all in one place and hopefully as an outflow of that give folks tools to our encourage folks to or just let me match really occur people coalescent and attracting and so forth yeah me and and one of the interesting things when you talked about that one person that you see going to everything yeah it's very much our break

I know it's it's I yesterday I talked to Patrick Walsh mm and he talked about the concept of a network Weaver yes and it's a person who he's got done on business cards yeah but but it's the ideas is that it's the one person that can go between these different communities and even describe this may be an inefficient way of communicating between different groups but you see this one guy he goes

to my dad it's a ring Network yeah yeah anybody can he can be the one person that shares information lets people know hey last one thought they talked about really testing in this one that the Python group in this one we're talking about testing it Ruby well this is something I learned them there and then it's able to transport those ideas in a fashion over to that side yeah

absolutely and it shouldn't be just one guy's job to do that right because it's not durable system I think we should be thinking about how we can proliferate good ideas and let them win in the marketplace of you know this precious time that we all have right and you know discourage steal ideas from becoming you know wrote Lee kind of like reached over

and over again I was at I've been to a job easy group in the past where the talking and i'm not selling but you know bless his heart yeah the guy given the talk was just sharing ideas and technologies that were very old and outmoded in my opinion and that group would have been much better served at you know are literally a user group that was happening the same night on the

other other side of time right and i would like to try to think about or have people who are like you know passionate I user groups is that how do we discourage the the groups that become stale or the toxic become stale again use that are stale and encourage the ones that are fresh because it's always easier for the entrenched interests like the long-running groups to keep going

it's much harder to start something new right if you make it cheaper to start something new maybe it'll work out one thing though is is it I I've worked the dust Renee Milan experience or are a group is a lot of group still and any talk about the new it's always a new ideas we I don't know if it's if stale I mean there I know which mean in the context of Stalin and in the way I

understand it is that stale is these are ideas that have been shared over and over and over again maybe some of them have been outdated or superseded but there's also old ideas that get forgotten oh you don't aren't brought forward in and shared again with the new have you seen anything in the group's you've gone to where they looked backwards oh absolutely so you know like

in my talk today for instance I'm talking about growing up story to software guided by test which was a book I was I think I measure the published in two thousand five years okay so a little dessert I mean I'm turning back the 60s yeah sure and so there's like you know I would love to see a small group that was just a interesting papers from the history of computer science right you

know group that got together every corner or something like Jim wire i got the ruby user brigade in columbus last year two years ago he gave a talk of like 10 of the greatest computer science papers in 60 minutes oh really right and he goes through each of them and makes the argument and does as much as you could possibly do until the timer runs out leavers out of the next paper and

and yet I see that every now and then I think that oftentimes what what happens but more organically is an idea is fail we successfully stopped talking about it for a few years and then somebody brings it up again because it's new to them because they haven't seen funny and so if it's a good idea to keep coming back up yeah you guys still be able to say this one's deprecated yeah yeah well

thank you very much for taking the time to sit down no thank you cycle I appreciate

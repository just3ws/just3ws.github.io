hi it's mike with you cassock i'm here at go to calm 2015 i'm saying you're with alexandra Masterson who is the conference organizer today and thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me now Howard's manager said conference organizer couples manager what what is the cap of ender and how did you come into that position so essentially the conference managers and

someone who just makes sure that everything is running smoothly make sure sponsors are happy that things like this are happening at the conference that out people outside of the space can interact and see what's going on also just to yeah make sure attendees are happy as well that's what's important thing you're kind of like the MC the party host no everybody's got enough to drink

you need more coffee at all yeah just you know kind of make sure everybody's having a good time and has what they need and you've actually helped me because I need an iron for this earlier husband so you've been very helpful and I also appreciate this room which none of you can see but it's very nice beautiful and it's quiet too so you know go too confident and and how do you

can't give me the conference manager you know first off it was did you come to go to come for did you happen to grow into a role with coach ooh yeah so I actually met my company try fork while I was at my sister's conference holidays amsterdam in berlin also tech conferences are a family thing yeah apparently we kind of fell into that and i met try fork there and i had past

experience with conferences and so we just kind of grew our relationship from there and la is our original conference manager but she is on maternity leave yes she is probably having a baby right now or she has had her baby oh yeah she's ready baby it's a little bridge lations me I and yes that's wonderful yeah last year we we interviewed with Neely and she's been a fantastic

supporter of you classic so best of luck and myself to her hustle but here at go to calm you know looking at to ramp up to this year there was some interesting events that took place and one of those was a meta meetup something a little bit about the ramp up or they're broke to go to come yeah so we like to do a the Chicago tech community is really important to us and we're just

essentially trying to build and strengthen that community feel so we like to host events bring speakers to certain user groups who are looking for speakers we work with the Chicago Java user group a lot of we've worked with the vaca Morningstar and we also host a meta go to night which is for meetup organizers community leaders tech influencers to kind of come together

brainstorm and trade ideas on what they want to see from the Chicago tech community yeah and I'm not going to involved in some of those and they're really interesting because it's bringing the go to banner as a kind of a rallying point for groups that might not otherwise interact like them yeah yeah so yeah it's great I mean that's one of the unique things I see about go to comp

not only that you guys keep inviting me to come back in the interviews but that you're really actually focused on not just oh this is a day of conference or a week of conference but then there's this whole kind of buzz building and ramp up to the actual day of the events yeah we want the community to make sure that we know that we're involved and we want to support you guys and make sure that we

can help as much as we can to make it the best that it can be so one last question as a conference organizer always hear about the one thing they would like to have their attendees keep in mind that helps with things like costs and things and dad's one thing ever in years past is water another is the cost of coffee so what what if you were to say it like becomes attendees

please there's one thing because there is either you can think of that you would say is advice maybe I guess just for our conferences in particular one of the questions that we get the most is what is the Wi-Fi password and all of our Wi-Fi passwords are actually cleverly located on the bottom of our badge on the front page so if you are treas what your Wi-Fi password is

service yeah it's right there it's also a super um so just read your badge this is a this is a Bible of information yeah yeah and it's one of the interesting things about a result of my about go to comp in in itself is that you guys have this in all the information is right around the neck yeah and that was commenting on that and a little preview video earlier that yeah it's something i

think all promises should consider if they have the budget for it yeah there it's these badges are amazing they have our full schedule speakers sponsors maps of the venue and QR code readers so that sponsors and other attendees can scan each other and stay connected yep so yeah so there's value that you know when we click on an ad on a webpage you know we're helping support that web page but

when you come to a conference and you let the the sponsors the vendors scandal match they know that they're getting value I hear the top really want to come back yeah okay I so remember your badge it's got everything any serious this army tool badge well thank you very much appreciate it and I appreciate being here go to cough again thanks for coming

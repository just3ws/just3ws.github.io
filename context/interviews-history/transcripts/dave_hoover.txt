hi I'm Mike I'm timing here with Gabe Hoover from groupon on a Tiva I he's the founder of geek fest a user group kind of an internal group that started at teva and his grown and now it's migrated over to Groupon so hi Dave thanks for my high can you tell us a little bit about geek trust and its origins and kind of where it is today sure we started geek fest in 2007 Adam teva it actually

didn't start as anything official it was just it was actually an official's study group we were studying Ruby refactoring a draft of the book that was being worked on at the time and there was about three apprentices in a kind of part-time contractor victoria wang adam teba at that point and it was just a time for the us to sit down and get away from our code a little bit and you would

do in Java actually at that time it was we were all learning ruby so I've been room doing to me for a number of years but that was like my first like full-time year in Ruby this was two dozen actually it I guess would have been the year before that but anyway it was it started as a study group around this book but as time went on we just going to morphed into more general

discussion and then we'd have people from teva who were out at clients come in and give talks I remember when Andy came and gave a talk on Scala later in 2007 and we just we got into a habit we would just all go out and grab sandwiches from like jimmy johns or something beforehand and then come back and and and either ack ack on code a little bit like fun code or we discuss a

book or we would have a presentation so it sounds kind of like inauspicious beginning to something that's now a packed house in a great many kathleen like I i I've noticed that over the years that like lots of development shops have like it's a healthy thing not like a lunch and learn but you like look like you're saying it's it's morphed yeah I mean even the years that I've

gone it's gone from being a few people around a table to fill the room too is overfilling and that's just when I was still a tivo I just kind of issuing though when you started to open up I mean I remember coming before I joined of teva coming to geek fest and and it wasn't quite public but it wasn't well yeah I mean so ever since the very beginning we've always been open to

outside people people that weren't adapt Eva and now I groupon I've always been open to people coming it's just we haven't ever had a huge reason to promote it a lot we still don't because we still don't we always run out of room very quickly so yeah it's always been a it's always been available to anybody pretty about a year after we've been doing we're doing it we did a bunch of

kind of feedback and surveys for people inside of ft a-- and quickly realize that geekfest have become this very very important part of what we were and at that point we were like okay well this has actually become like this kind of / benefit sort of thing so we should actually start buying lunch but let's get out of this habit of people having to run out and grab lunch and come back

let's just get lunch ordered yeah so we started doing that and that still goes on today we buy lunch for about 80 people or so sometimes over that and some some people from the outside it's not just internal only um and that's one of things with the acquisition it one from being you know like a tight-knit group that had kind of formed with on identity along the depressing it was

something I can speak to this that was of great concern coming in to groupon and getting acquired by a large company I mean most outside user groups are kind of independent to me they operate worries geekfest was really identified with the team and seeing them to get acquired you know in any persevered through that even though I was really worried but it has grown it has changed

no it's still a chance to you know what what do you think is keeping it that it's it's that it's still keep fast I mean why do you think that even though it's so much bigger now that it's still how do you keeping the spirit so yeah I think um the the spirit of geek fest has always been a place but it grew into the spirit of geek fest started off was just like some people

learning some stuff together but over the years I think the most consistent theme or spirit has been a place to go a fairly safe place to go on in practice presentations or use this group as a sounding board for ideas or open source projects I think with the size now it's more intimidating I always wanted it to be a place where a nude a new presenter could come and do their first talked a

while to kind of feel some of their jitters out it's it's there's still people willing to do that as first-time presenters or as young presenters but that's certainly more intimidating nowadays yeah like a room of 80 people yeah it like I've seen it's almost like that being at a mini conference now then but I mean at that said like we have an 18 year old presenting next week right

on apprenticeship so I'm happy about that I'm also happy that people like Chris McEvoy and Adrian hope you see his last name ola body came over the last in the last month and kind of presents it either they presented their of their projects they're open source projects where they're open badges or Django I mean and Adrian came and I loved Adrian's talk because it I it wasn't

fully baked right he was like saying this is something I'm working on I'm interested in people's reactions to this that's the perfect use of geek fest is a place to like get your ideas out there and and engage you know community interest yeah and it that's one of the histories of geek us I remember is it people weren't afraid to give their opinion and say I don't know about what

you just did yeah so I think that's one thing we need to like how that it's been about how as long as it's been eight months I think since the acquisition well we need to do a little bit better job of people speaking up more and interrupting and asking questions and giving their opinions like like we pretty good we had a pretty thing good thing going with that yeah about a year

ago yeah and I can see you know kind of one of my favorite memories was Brian Merrick coming out and doing his hands on where we pretended to be a computer program I was a button I said click and and we had messaging and things then it was a lot of fun and it was a practice for him to go to it was one of the agile conferences where he was going to work with business users so so they could

understand some of the complexities and so that's like a favor member of mind from lucky trust do you have any like that kind of Oh favorite memories um good question I mean Adrienne's talk a week ago was definitely a highlight for me like there's literally people standing outside of the room looking through the glass wall hoping to pick up what he was talking about and the fact

that like probably ninety five percent of the people in the room were all rubyists listening to a guy from from the Python community obviously I was great um I just thinking back I remember our old friend Fred bvlgari just being like a superstar okie invest in terms of like being a critical thinker and asking people to think through things and asking tough questions to like that so

I'd love to see him at a geek fest again soon but uh try to think I don't know it's just I'm just proud that it's just continued to go I think a lot of that comes from well we have our apprentices or organize it and I think they provide a lot of enthusiasm about the whole thing yeah that is an interesting thing to bring out that it's it's not just something that you manage or or females

it's something to help spring the apprenticeship prime apprentices gives them an investment in the community I think that's kind of itch I'm interested that you have like Ethan who now runs and helps with the Windy City DB I'm going to be interviewing him next week oh I'm gonna ask him about he trusts and how maybe that might have given him an instructions community leadership sure

so yeah when he was doing I don't know if he was respond before it back tonight I think we might have lost I was he okay um yeah it all blends but actually like think about one I may be the easiest for me highlight would have been we had three of our past apprentices kind of gone come and give a talk to future apprentices right which actually I guess eat them did wasn't

there for that but um anyway that was definitely a highlight to have that kind of full circle sort of talk okay and just so people know that it's a geek fest is here at groupon on chicago 600 west every tuesday you can go to the gathers us site to sign up for that or follow geekfest on twitter and see what's coming up yep games best duck gathers us geekfest gathers all saw the

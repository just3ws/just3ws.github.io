hi it's mike with you tastic i'm at Wales comp 2014 and I'm standing here with Evan light evan is the or father and lead organizer for d camp which is in in Washington DC just outside just outside Washington DC and he's also an active contributor to open source for a long time in the Ruby community I thank you for taking the time to to talk sure um so we had spoken about decamp a few

years ago i had windy city rails where is worst he can't pronounce a place it was to be not but as far as its organization is it growing you have more people coming or how do you I know you manage your you like to cure your audience I am I don't let it grow I let we have different people we don't have more people I have some rules of thumb i use for that and one of them is if I

can't memorize everyone's name it's too big well tell how many people can you memorize I know I can do 70 70 I don't know about more than that but I know I can do 77 I can make it through my head for a few days okay not necessarily after that right right finally see one year at the event you like to keep it personal i want it that's yes exactly that decamp it is more community than

conference about so for people who might not know what decamp is what of what is different than like work at railsconf or in a hotel this is a conference you know talk at you in conferences you have brakes were you talk to other people that's all very informal instructor than lots of crowds decamp is a nerd kommune in the woods okay so it is it's out and away from from civilization so sort've

it's a princeling for stones throw from civilization yeah except we're the DC area so if stones throws a long ways of traffic oh it's just off of Route 95 south in Prince William Forest Park which is a national park and they have these cabin camps that kind of like the kind of thing you might have lost a time in over the summer as a kid there may actually historical significance there

left over from the the previously precursor to the CIA I forget the name of loft my head trained in these camps so we use captain came three it supports 78 people and for the other is dating 77 seconds 37 to me 78 people that's that's number of people who can sleep there overnight we could technically have more during the day but I'm adamant that we that

everyone who comes they have to stay the whole time okay so yeah the point is to get away from civilization yes there's internet but only if you bring it okay you don't act i don't actually supply it at the venue but the whole point is to get away for a civilization to isolate that group for three days and the community forms okay get some sunshine get a little fresh air not so much

sunshine no trace of us always but yes the idea yeah then lots of pressure yeah okay so how do you how do people go do they do let you an open call for people to join our gotta manage attendees so one of the aspects of d camp is not is well it's an exclusive event and I wins with that word a little I tried to be even-handed about getting people about having people come in and to do that I

don't choose the vast majority of people who come I am I think advantage of eventbrite they have a system of creating promotional codes okay and so what I do is I create a bunch of different promotional codes that are good for the 225 registrations and I see those with people I know and trust in the community I feel a little bit bad doing that sometimes because over time a

lot of these people have become close friends of mine right I don't want it to be having differences of evidence camp I want it to be something more than just that but these are people who I trust so I tell them find talented passionate amazing people and that and I explicit with them it doesn't mean experts that doesn't mean now this isn't doesn't begin immediate it means all tryna and I

also ask them try not to find all of one or all the other look that's going to mix different skillsets perspectives importance of how we avoid becoming a monoculture fine and then we kind of do that I guess is a few rounds see how many people gobble up codes and after the first round of codes go out and then do it until we fill up okay and then if

somebody can't showed you open that spot back up ideally have I've done a few people push back against as most people supported this though up until a few years ago we would only have two thirds attendance is a lot of people just not show up right so I decided at that point I'm sorry to be clear he came is free right you just have to get there so I think people here free and they get a

code they sign up and then they don't feel any obligation to cancel but decamps cost money to produce the sponsors pay money they don't currently they don't get any particular influenced by sponsoring they get their name attached the ones who spend the most money get on the t shirt I'm thinking about having a scholarship sponsors for to pay for travel expenses for some

people can't afford to company really ought to come derogate from coming but these fathers don't get that much out of it and so not having people show up means that that's money left on the table as money wasted and sponsors are losing out that way the inner participants lose out that way Deacon's contents driven by everyone who comes so forever to make attendance thunders and

it's a needed content exactly then we're all less for it so what I've said is if you cancel within less than two weeks of the event you're banned you don't get to come back for at least two years Wow yeah so the lights a fire for people be aware and it also lets people know the hey this does kind of we invited you as a friend and you can't snubbed us so yeah so since I've done that we've had

I think only one no show a year for two years now so it's pretty much work great and Jim to the same way into your open source party right now you're with rackspace we're working with their open source outreach what what is that what is that what is what are they doing well I guess I'm a lot of the face to the Ruby community Rackspace and one part of these so-called developer relations

group and and our job is a few different fault as far as cup goes i'm working on a lot of our Ruby SDKs so that's fog is our official SDK okay and that is that we work with the other other developers and focus fog is it come to the end of itself right and then we have other tools that either work with fog or just another ways integrate with our cloud like we have favorite Rackspace which

under the hood uses fog yes and knife rack space which I actually haven't touched yet paperclip and carrier wave I think we were only really just finally starting to realize that we can a lot of traffic from that probably so we're trying to work with those to better support fog and Rackspace so a lot of my involvement is driven by Rackspace's interests in open source but to that

extent that's just where I'm involved how I'm involved though I was hired with the understanding I'd be trying to look out not just for rackspace book for the Rubik family right and fog has been around for several years since used by lots of people but for pick up for any projects theorem for several years there's lots of crafts and we're trying to make things better wait for right now

I'm working on collaboration guys at HP on writing a new OpenStack front end for fog we call provider okay I guess not only front-end switch is you can say plugin but is how do you interact through fog to OpenStack and going forward also we we Rackspace are hosting a summit for some of the top contributors and fog to try to create more of a roadmap and get more consensus

around we're fog will go as a project over time I've talked through westbury a little bit edginess the guy who created fog he's indicated kind of grew by accretion that he started with a fairly modest goal but a lot of people have adopted me from lots of code at it but there hasn't been there hasn't been a whole lot of stopping catching me

catching a breath and trying to figure out what to do next so it's gotten fat hairy and so the hope is with the summit that will reestablish a sense of direction and have some plan for going forward so by having you head Rackspace you're able to be that intermediary who understands it has been a participant in the community for a long time I go between engineering and management

style-- of the people person yes you got it okay well thank you very much for taking the time to speak appreciate out see what user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today at your casa calm

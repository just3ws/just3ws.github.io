hi I'm like all I'm sitting down here with Scott Seeley who is he runs the Lake County Down that user group and he's in the Jeffrey general director so it's very involved with the community in the in the Midwest region so Scott can you tell me a little bit about Lake County down there user group why you founded it and as regional director what have you kind of experienced with the

user group community in and around Chicago or actually what region do you cover okay so first off lakhani doesn't user group was founded by myself in another gentleman named Tim stall item and I both saw that need to have a user group in the northern burbs just because of the fact that the Chicago area due to the traffic and the way that everything everybody's kind of spread out yeah

people don't like driving more than 40 minutes from home right because of that you wind up with user groups southern Chicago some of the north south western burbs I don't know of any down the southern burbs obviously but that's what wound up happening so Tim and I both live north of Chicago and want something closer to home and going to downers grove are done it user group meetings so

that's why we found it it was pretty much we didn't like driving right and we wanted to get we like when using openings right now at it Lake County we've gotta have attendees our mailing list I guess its best way to measure that and about 500 different people have shown interest at one point or another so that's on how many people we notify every time we have a meeting on average

we get about 20 to 40 people typically closer to the 20 side forward folks show on typically the same people coming back or you get new blood coming in how is that it seems that we have like you'll go in streets where you'll have five or six people who will be there several months in a row and then they just kind of turns over we have some folks have been going pretty regularly for the past

several years and then make up just change the F people who that's part of the regular schedule for a while then they get a new contract somewhere else they go elsewhere and then when the contract ends there closer to home they also have to start showing up again ok so the regulars but just life sometimes life happens yeah as far as the regional director thing goes that's

just a honorary title which means for Microsoft saying how you've been very academic community so my original director is kind of a weird name I don't actually have a reality or no title oh yeah it sounds real fun is a real title it's just that it's not painted that's very descriptive title yeah yeah another director of Microsoft more nor do I have a region particularly do as I say that

for a given population center will build aside to fund a regional director and the funding happens at Microsoft where they have there's a person that's actually paid corporate to make sure that we're getting the right information there are people at corporate who spend time with us on internal stuff telling us what's happening so we can better articulate to the community and drive

events that sound like this person yeah for that you're you're so well known in the community trial that you're a great person talk to you to be like a pivot for from getting all that information right or are you I'm at least well enough known to Microsoft I have the ambition to get stuff done and eventually than the you the fame comes as a result of the pot of the program so

it was willing to do the work at employer and it's a carbon based system microsoft doesn't pay you but the opportunities themselves that's where you get your benefits okay and you know and when they say region you're talking Chicago language and it isn't middle is too so it's sometimes so there's another art there are several argues in your body that we have there's a belief it's

dan wall lean I hope I'm not mistaking weird and it's actually located we have a few folks over Michigan we've got rocky laka up in Minnesota there's me and then if you start heading south you'll get to anybody until you get to the Marcus eggers in Texas oh and Todd fine sitting in Georgia but between Illinois so you have Missouri what's the sticky notes yeah yeah yeah because if I

geography horrible Louisiana nothing and doesn't reflect on the IT community it just reflects on people who stood up in the community at Microsoft just decide that level okay but you have this scared throughout many we get to the south again all of a sudden via concentrations like there's a guy named todd find mark done we're both fairly close to each other so until rocky and I being close

to each other between Chicago and group meeting happens okay all right well thank you very much for some down with a Scott appreciate it yep Scott Seeley Lake County down at user group thanks

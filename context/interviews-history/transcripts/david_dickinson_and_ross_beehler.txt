hi I'm Mike I'm sitting down here with Ross and David from South Bend software craftsmanship user group we're going to talk a little bit about user group that they run and so can you just tell us a little bit about their what do you guys do with this off that user group obviously it's about that but can you give a little bit more details sure so I'll serve a little bit of history we

used to have a dinette user group that was dying and decided that we needed to make a language agnostic technology agnostic and now we had a couple people going up to Chicago to their software craftsmanship user group and now we like what we saw and we connected with some of the people there to get ideas and assistance and we just started started the group in South bed and we meet once

every two months and we we typically meeting is a speaker talks for for a little while and then we have open discussion afterwards right with the speaker like if I to give advice for for the smaller cities myself then reach out to those software craftsmanship community and our big city near you put Chicago has been instrumental helping us they've been setting up speakers like

Uncle Bob and and people from I'm teabagger bond and and eight flights interested in helping us out as well so definitely look for help there's plenty of people in the community are willing to help yeah so like you said you've gone to kind of a semi monthly cycle once you guys go BYE MOM through any Nam semi-monthly versus doing a monthly schedule that seems to be kind of like I

have common patterns I think all harvas lacrosse legends we're done earlier just for the workload yeah but I think that our goal would be a do it more often and we're moving towards to having weekly meetings to we can prove it in the movie world and I imagine their beliefs about the suburban team to do one of these speakers something like that so yeah I'm curious like you specially said Ruby

what is it about why do you funny gravity towards Ruby versus just stop any other so so our towns primarily em so just introduce some diversity why in a different different school of thought and ruby has kind of a community might set anyways it's so just to bring find those who do don't repeat that we're not connecting with bring clothes for scrap

inazuma into our group would also increase our sense of community as well I think Microsoft guys are used to having a Microsoft dish than a community right and we'd be able to move it's harder to find the same sort of thing with PHP or Python or not as close-knit we want to move out of a compiled language I did anyway I'm out of a compiled language into a dynamic

language just see what would happen there Lucas you move into another place but it's already home there's a house there built oh yeah so it's it's yep kind of a preconceived notion of the community that comes wrong but kind of an established microsoft developer base and you're looking at well where else could we go from that looking at the Ruby community but she's been really

active you saying that that seems to be kind of appealing like I'm easier transition because you have an idea where you're going to knotts kind of point atoms yeah yeah yeah I'd like to stress that then the software crashing sugar is technology agnostic right we still have speaking our speakers talk about soft skills or higher level only know our teacher yeah so but we also

need to have the people get used to getting together and care program and stuff like that so we're using Ruby since it's a new language that's an avenue to do that so we're going to teach people Ruby get them together Dukat this together learn how to do TDD stuff like that so it's that's this is the focus for taking in a you know we did have a little brief conversation

before and we talked about how you know south bend your I kind of a it's more of a residential community where people are commuting to and from South Bend so you have a little bit of a challenge dealing with Chinese people in end the evening cerner early mornings you know like what is your attendance of like when you're trying to do an evening mean does it usually seem to be awesome

over overly impacted by the fact if you are commuting to southbound vs Sher Singh right there since we do meet once every two months our meeting attendance is usually 30 or so which which isn't bad but for the more collaborative building type meetings that we have like a code and coffee which can initial in the morning which we have trouble getting people to come out so for this

Ruby exercise we're gonna we're going to partake any we're gonna do it during lunches okay so we'll just meet at up at a kind of a commonplace consistently once a week and we think we'll get a lot better attendance at lunchtime yeah yeah lunch is Allah is having a family myself I could I test you those midday banks or a little bit easier to accommodate the schedule yeah okay well you guys have a

website will be posting that along with the the length to multiple bonus and websites just I should wave a linkedin group oh you have a linkedin group yeah but we are evaluating different methods okay this is it a public group that will be able to me too okay great all right well thank you very much Ross and David appreciates in Dallas me take care

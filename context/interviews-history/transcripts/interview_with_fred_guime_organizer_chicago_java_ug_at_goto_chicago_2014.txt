hi in smite with you task I'm here go to cop 2014 I'm sitting here in front gimme who is the president of the Chicago tava users group thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me my pleasure lat sorry I should have a job users group in the president you're the president of the Chicago chop it uses yeah ssl so great it sounds like a very formal 15 to wear robes sub oh yeah yeah

we have putting one cuts of wood oh not really you know that I was coming to visit but no I so the group I know it's been through a few iterations but can you tell me about where it is now and how you got involved with it so so it it is but so what happens is is we sort of went to like a phase where were you know there was a couple of transition to heaven and and I know the group was on

as activists as you know like it to be in Chicago so one of the things that happened was you know I started getting involvements are going in you know we got you know well Colleen might know I didn't know any pendulum here and then we start working with the group and one of the things you wanted to do is is through this idea that what are you walking away yeah sorry sort of this

idea that Chicago it's a great place of your developer right right so so we looked around and and it's sort of like started like selfish because so you know I work for for company in Chicago and then we're laying there looking for developers and the sort of you realize they're nowhere to be found you know it's like you know that we go to we went to universities and then we see like oh

there's brain during its like people are you going coordinator going to New York they don't want to stay here in Chicago I we're like why is that and part of it is it was like you know there's we do have like a Midwestern values people just work and stuff but but we're missing that sort of like that the programmer culture in here and we're like we have such big companies you know

you know like Google's opening an office here you know we definitely have you don't like a group one is here you know orbitz is here you know CME is here such many developers and we're trying to figure out how can we make this a better place for being adult so so you know the first things you know sorry you know you start doing a podcast in a java pop house ok Tom and then it if you know

it's sort of trying to educate people on programming Java then we go to java one and that was java house yeah ok n.com so so if you check the last hopefully do yeah so so so then then we go to count one so you go back to your group get involved so you know come back here you know we see that the group was in transition because of prior to President you know it was moving away just you

know job relocation and serveware stat and a little bit mean our meetings were sort of like you know you showed up there was you know the presenter there were like seven people showed up you know two of the word recruiters one of them was part of the sea job in Otago a user's group representative and there you get three people that show up because they always like to show up so

so then then we're like looking at this is this is pretty bad because we have so many chi cago job of golfers so so we took it like a year and a half ago in which that we're going to push it we're going to start you didn't work out and we're going to start having a schedule we're going to start ringing good speakers and and it took a lot of effort you know we open up a meet up we

organize the lead ups and and you know we grew up from essentially you know five ten people now in our meetup group we have we just crushed 900 Wow so I mean you brought it back to me know what it was a life support yeah I wouldn't sleep Mia it is usually my bros are presently ropes idea no but the reality is we got a lot of no I mean I was lucky enough to run into into online marvel

you know Denny in and they all like like give back the spirit you know I mean it as you know you have to sort of be crazy to do this user groups break there's there's there's really no benefit you know of to it like you know I mean there might be some but through there's some financial benefit is more time and a little bit lot of pain but you know when you get that guy is you know thanks for

everything no it's a super cool then it's like right that made my day for the next month and we really push it because we I do believe and I always say this it's like a preacher every time I go and talk to our group is like Chicago has no reason to MV New York or California you know we have such a great programmers here because you know need to sort of

like your them out because what happens is is we have so many medals so much Midwestern values that we just wear it we're going to go you know but but there's no reason for people to move anywhere else you know we can create a culture here and that's what we've been trying to go to teach up but the interesting parts that we're doing is you know we first started with with one

prime you know we won meeting on you know and then then we sort of like expanded that now we have two meetings a month where one of them is essentially you know that we have an advanced track for people that are like you know bleeding-edge technology type of deal you know that's where you get to see elasticsearch that's what you get to see the new features of spring you know we

sort of have like a like a sort of like I colors are like an introductory front where is you know it injured the multitrader intro to you know you know how to how to do unit testing you know I and the idea is you know that if we have supported we have the bet we can start at intertrans we have enough people already you know in our group that there's there's simply different

interests that we can target well yeah right now Java is kind of gone home and still in the throes of that revolution on languages the JVM has always been Multi multi lingual yeah but now we're looking at scala we had a keen Rubio you know Jane I'm we have Martin order ski give Antonio memory so Scala is you its closure huge JRuby of course instead also we are under yeah there's some

amazing work and then the Android platform are you looking at some cross-pollination of ideas using my coverage Ruby literally isn't that does the other thing though the winners are trying to sort of seen it you know I mean weird we're not just doing job anymore we're sort of trying to be more JVM driven right and and and one of the things that we're experimenting we are

sort of adding one or two taking one or two of our sessions and they're doing more of like a JVM friends you know if you're groovy do not over if you are doing closure and and and we're trying to see how those fit in if there is interest because sometimes what happens is you see java developer don't know oh gosh i could have used college you have used a ruby

here you know and and what we're trying to do is sort of lights they think it's not just about java you know there's you have choices brown and then you know just you can be aware of them and how you can use them in your daily work yeah java becomes a language on the job off yeah commits from the day via reddit but I mean I and all series most somebody's languages are so polished that it did

they stand on their own yeah you know right beside job is as a first class citizen on the JVM so it it sounds like there's like the world is your oyster for for java developers right now if you know how to if you already understand the fundamentals of the JVM jars none of that infrastructure you can do a lot no an S and that's the fun part is is it's if your age of the vote for it's a great

time to be one because you know you can you can just sit down look at it and play with all the older stuff that is coming out you know even all the way we just like you know like JRuby which is starting honored you know he's his treason but you know it's like the word he does is great you know I mean there's the work that is being done on the JVM itself which is sometimes you put

understand like the JVM the machinery the rostov's has like 20 years so the most brilliant minds just putting it you know that Charlie hon you got even got ill today that you got give them all which which is the clips founder you know they all have their voyages they always talk to always figure out how to do things better so that you know if you're a JVM use if you don't have to

write and and you know and that's one of the other things like you know what I wanted to say about our group is is we're trying to educate people about all these things right so one of them is is hope there's tons of choices premium and you shouldn't just look at Java us the only tool that you and but the only thing we're doing is we're training them or or we're trying

to spread the word about what a JSR is what the JCP you know I would agree beside remember you know it's a participant another voting member or a participant on to JCP process right so what that means is we're starting to have influenced you know and and the end goal of the chick-fil-a users group will be to one day you know look at the biggest ones is London in Brazil and you

don't say look guys you know we are representative we are you know we actually make an influence from the language we in a way we've our group we help shape the way Java moves in the future so you're even looking at beyond simply having a community come together and have replaced it surely is in communicate but also to help build a cross wall to be able to help become

part of the future rods but platform which is fun because the things that we're doing is is for example we have sort of like this by a weekly newsletter right and in this year's letter wheel we have like a professional explainer which is sort of breaking down like things like this is the j of stars this is the JCP this is how you contribute this is how you know these are the ones that

seem interesting for us to contribute on and then then we're sort of creating that with what up how one is doing which is getting the doors now right right there's a lot of people that you know they love to like sit down and enter like passively receive the information that is great but we also want to sort of like Taylor al to who like the makers are so so like Bob is creating this what

is called a native pride which is not so much as being on a lecture but it's almost you can think it about it happens hot days people that know like want to sit down and type so so one of the great things we're trying to do is we're trying to say hey we know you're out there let's get you in you know this kid you get the language even better you know let's let's make chicken irrelevant

not just in terms of us being della consumers but in terms of shaping the history of job and even without the open source and I know that there are people that work with here in Chicago that are creating their own platforms and tools on top of Java one person interview this week or olive oil which created a little sweet sauce now is building a salty on top of those tools but people

are doing some here in Chicago yes you don't have to go to wherever ah you know wherever out the guys are pretty really aware whether do not own expense for cargo or somewhere else but there's people here in Chicago or create yeah working your job and doing interesting things with a platform and that's what we want to hear about I mean we want to want to get them out and get them a

given with stage for them to say hey this is happening here just think note right right I got it that this is a rich community it isn't just a bunch of people reporting punch in punch out now and as and that's what we're trying to you know I mean that that's the reason why why you know CEO is there an ounce we're trying to spread the word we try to make the community here even I just

big but influential so if we're going to meetup.com hope you will find if I should Chicago travel right yeah we should be the first link you know like to go without you see job our website is CJ Borg see Jamie org yeah okay bring and then yeah I we're done meet up so you know sign up come on we want to get our goal is to get to 1500 people and meet up by the end of the year so okay

I just did a video where I shared some of my equipments and my scheduling strategies that I use here at the conference but I also wanted to kind of share a little bit about how I set up the interviews and kind of dish meal that I give each each interviewee right before i do an interview basically I say okay you know can you please stand over here and I'll direct them in front of

the camera and try to set them at ease that this is going to be a conversation between me and them and the model I I try to describe is that's weird a conference and we bumped into each other and maybe they're doing a session or the working on a project or doing something or they have a user group and they're going to tell me I'm going to be like somebody just like hey what is this

thing that you're doing you know can you tell me about that thing and to treat the camera as if it's somebody who just happened to walk up to us while we're at the conference and just was curious as to what was going on and they just want to you know listen in because that kind of happens at conferences you'll be talking to somebody having a kind of an interesting-looking conversation and

somebody'll just walk up and say hey what's going on and or just listening quietly and because I say as you know is we might be having this conversation at a conference and somebody walks up to us and us being polite people we would maybe occasionally address the camera we don't have to pretend like the camera isn't there we can that we can talk to it just as if we would talk to somebody

who just unanimously walked up to us and I say you know I'm going to then you know once they once the interviewee feels comfortable about that and understands and any questions they might have you know whether they can look at the camera and things like that and you know who they should be talking to I will just say all right I'm going to turn to the camera an I'm gonna say hi

i'm mike with you tastic I'm your dad a dot had none of that and I'm standing here with Dada and he's or she's going to be talking about that or runs this group so you might have heard that if you listen to a few interviews he might have heard that exact pattern over and over again but yeah I usually say hi my name is mike with you tastic and i am here at and i tried to give the name of

the conference or wherever I'm at up front I've learned that is also a good way of being able to identify different interviews not just by the backgrounds so I hope that I might be interesting about how interviewers are introduced excuse me interviewees are introduced to the interviews thanks bye

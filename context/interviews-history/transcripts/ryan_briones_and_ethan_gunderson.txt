hi I'm Mike sitting down again with Ryan Briones and you think Gunderson the these guys created gathers us it's a website for managing user group information our group events and also are the founders of the Chicago DB user group thanks Ryan even for sitting down again we had a little snafu technical snafu beforehand but uh so what we discussed earlier is it gathers us had a

pretty interesting origin that it was based off of one need that you get in creating chicago TV can you describe a little bit about some of the inception of gathers us and what what that is I mean it is for some usergroups I've used it myself and I know geekfest uses it it's to great success and you get a lot of signups I mean well over 100 each week look um but how did how did get

resist come out of how would he be well there were two major things that happen one we were too cheap to use a tool that costs money there's a couple of another big one which was be kind of the biggest impetus first to create our own especially when we kind of like had this idea for the group but we didn't know how it was going to it was going to be successful or not we'd want to pay money

for something was just going to be that wasn't going to like have legs and go on kind of the second thing though a personal gripe of mine is that a lot of other meeting websites in order to attend an event they force you to sign up and actually have an account with their site before you can attend that event and so there's another big like design goal with gathers us was to make

it dead simple to both create an event and an event only information you provide as your first name last name and email and then you know you can attend another gym have any promise spam I'm because it's so easy to get in there uh yes Oh may I know you have a cap champ but that's the reason why okay and is that actually been effective hasn't happened since so

interested oh good luck um but like you said it was born out of a knee when you were creating a Chicago DB so question is earlier was what what database did you end up using I'm considering that you're a database group and that would be kind of a critical question what database is scan there's no small-time uh so the database the database be used as Marco um for no particular reason

whatsoever yes other than I want an argument okay and in some of the things that you learn in creating gathers us for those things that you're able to kind of bring back into on the meeting so you start off you want to have a user group about databases and not learning database technologies so you create a site to support that pic the database in you know did you learn anything about it

and be able to bring that back into what you were sharing with the group um yeah we never did anything with a group on it I did give to talks at Mongo conferences about the data strategies that we used for storing our data I've set the time which was probably the biggest pain point using Mongo is that almost none of that was documented everyone was using their own yeah so do our leading-edge be

right there so and that's the thing about being a bleeding edge you bleed it's me I so going into the group um you know you finally riverboats you said about two years ago and tore through you yeah and what kind of format did you follow when you were doing extra as well as the typical structure of the meeting well kind of it is illustrated as you know the inception of Gannicus is

that was kind of our are like the reason why we had to create a group like this is because you know we essentially decided on using Mongo kind of just out of a like it might as well been flipping a coin or something like that you know we had no idea why Mongo we've better from than any other database and so what our goals were to design a group that was focused around like this deep

learning of you know what makes a particular database better than another understand like the core of that so that we can apply that to our normal day-to-day stuff you know there's a lot of good talent in Chicago a lot of people that have had experience both with modern non-relational databases and people that have a lot of experience building applications on relational

databases as well so we figured that in a selfish way we could kind of leech off of the knowledge that's here in Chicago and kind of take that to the next level so we did that in two different ways the format of the group was kind of designed around that like every user group we had a portion of the group is kind of like a face forward presentation style part where someone would talk about

technology or something like that but to start out the night we would do we would read these database white papers that would kind of give us some kind of deep knowledge about a particular technology like dynamo or big table or something like that and kind of maybe set the stage for what we were going to talk about later that day okay in anything really interesting in that you learn

from bringing these white papers yourself but or anything that was kind of surprising about that um on its ear oh so the biggest thing for me was the realization that basically no no new ideas have come all the database theory in the last 35 years yeah so things like the dynamo paper are just like group of ideas presented slightly differently but they're all 35 years old and then you

also mention something about the specificity of some of the original or the modern no sequel implementations came out of really specific concerns like the Dynamo being the shopping cart back end from amazon now it's got millions of things bolted onto its regular give full databases that are built throughout that yeah that paper both from amazon and from competition

and you know looking adds up at the trying to cover these technical white papers it's it's it's a very large undertaking even just when you're trying to understand yourself and grab get your hands around his white papers getting people to read these papers once a month didn't that's a something that was easy to do did you have lots of people saying guess summer reads rebury given an

hour-long presentation on on its contents was that a challenge uh was challenged man I mean the written most the time people would not read the paper and kind of one of the things we wanted to do you know it was would be rough for us to be the ones that kind of like led the discussion every month would be the only one the only voices in the group so we tried to get people to volunteer do

we had a couple of good core members that would kind of step up from time to time to do that but essentially trying to get people to volunteer to lead the discussion on a particular paper was rough yeah kind of a jerk earlier that it's maybe you don't necessarily even understand it all yourself and also you try to present which is probably why we had a hard time

getting people to volunteer no one wants to try to lead a discussion about a topic that they don't truly understand yeah and a lot of those white papers are hard yeah yeah it's they're very they're very technical ring yes I'm going pretty ivory tower ish lots of math yeah yeah there's a lot of matter hey that's a d ok yeah meeting go so the other papers in yoga said they were very tough

and that people would be trying to to come in and it present on these papers if you looked at any other formats like bringing in vendors or anything bizarre any anything you've learned trying to be the reach out to a mongo company or a like and get them to come in if you did you do anything like that we've had people contention um I don't think anyone from past shuttle min base some

base the the issue that we've kind of had with bringing vendors in is that they're more or less interested in like converting you to use their database which is usually leads to more like a sales pitch II kind of presentation instead of like a low level technical talk right like it's really hard to get a better to tell you the trade-offs that you're making right right yeah Maddie's

Mongo if you're trying to do you XYZ but we're from rien it's like yeah it's it's toning I'm their best interest rate back but ok in what is the future do you have a plans for for reviving the group or how is how was um forward into the future la charla DB I don't it hasn't been totally decided yet what will happen um the interest in the group has died down a little bit i think that's

mostly due to specialized user groups forming like we have a react I do basically any relatively are still popular no single database has its own user group in Chicago down right um but what I nice even though it was really difficult to do the white papers are still my favorite part about the group um and so I've been tossed around the idea of

doing a general computer science white paper easier oh yeah but so you can see the same amount of fracturing it's so economic said that would be a kind of frustrating is where is you started with trying to understand the core tenants that could be applied to any of those database systems now people of kind of segregated themselves by their platform this I can see them might be kind of

frustrating order oh you think it's a good thing or I don't mind it yeah like Ryan said the the whole purpose of the group flow so that we can learn and I learned so that's all I can all achieve yeah how much you have something very cool out of it I can't resist it's very popular so well thank you very much for sitting down Ryan I don't want to keep you guys from your chickens very much

thanks

like again with you tastic i'm here at the chicago center meeting with Arthur ok Arthur Katie I he founded the suction user group but thank you for taking the time to sit down at me of what is not sure why do you have a user group so sentra is a tech company that makes a series of JavaScript frameworks as well as some supporting tools to help developers build desktop and mobile

applications and so we started the group because we have a tremendous user community both here in Chicago and around the world and I wanted to kind of gather the community here in Chicago since this is where I'm bees okay so why you say the javascript tools one of one of the big uns people know so primarily should know primarily people are going to know such a touch or our pjs products

which are jobs for libraries for building either mobile or desktop based web application this is M Rafael Reif Raphael is a sort of side a side project that we have built up and extended to build the charting packages with in both sencha touch and Yuki James okay so it's more like a lower level API yes okay yes it's um to touch is too big for building a mobile yes yes that's correct okay so

so you're supporting that people are using different walks in these tools for you know such employee or yeah so I were divorced Asha my role is on the professional services team the solutions engineer okay and that kind of boils down to going out to our larger clients to help you product trainings to physically help build applications sometimes I speak your conferences and

do a variety of other things so what what kind of topics you mature subcommittee groups so should eat yeah that's the top sunshine so here at the Chicago we cover a variety of topics almost always geared towards the sencha tools and center grams so this not for example we are talking about siesta which is a unit testing framework some ups we cover

sense of touch and go in depth and do how to build custom components sometimes we cover native packaging essential offers some native packaging tools sometimes we even cover topics that are directly related to sensious frameworks if there are there outlining JavaScript libraries and I plug into an application or a methodology that developers like one use in their own projects that

sometimes will have a guest speaker come in and present those happens as well because you're so a bunch of a JavaScript based system do you ever do you ever ever worked with the local JavaScript proofs cross meeting this or anything once in a while yeah other a few times will be or I should see that I have gone out and spoken at the Chicago javascript meetup they've been kind of

to host us I think twice and I've been to a force comm meeting and I've been trying to get some other of these groups to come in and present like I said some sub topics that plug it into the ecosystem that sencha developers are going to be something familiar with so something web or native based how we in a javascript manner and so far only anything like a back-to-basics papers

from mm oh yeah oh yeah this has nicks so what that's really what made you want to start the groove and how long has the group to the group's been around for not quite two years now and back when sencha first hired me which was the winner of two thousand 10 they are say I have previously been using sentence products and it was trying to connect with other developers

here in Chicago and doesn't overly gather enough steam to get the group off the ground and once essential brought me on board they made it very easy to facilitate that they would provide some sponsorship of paying for the meetup com site that we have and that really allowed me to go out and find people get the location that we have to meet every month and then bring people in the group

okay great in a so actually kind of answer my next question I was going to ask about the sponsorship that's obviously subject is very interested in and supported like how about how many people to usually see this it's uh like I just said like when I saw the such a group I had to do a little bit of research you in front of what some cheese I don't know how know like how do

you go about sharing that there is this group and also reaching people that might not otherwise no of the tool case sure so I'm not the month basis the number of people that we have attending vary somewhat usually we get between 15 and 40 people every month and usually people have found the group either through meetup com meaning that they have been members of other jobs for

groups and notice that we are here from signed up or on the section message boards I can go out and advertise that we've got a group looking for people here in Chicago okay so there's a channel through the center there's a channel there and then as I said central it really goes out of their way to help support our group as well as the other groups that are around the country so if

you have downloaded one of our products you're probably on the centrum lists and once every couple of weeks when we send out here at the upcoming events that central will be at they will highlight some of the user groups in the air is so those are primarily the avenues that people find us sometimes it's just a word of mouth of colleagues and co-workers will tag along with

people okay so what is your typical schedule we typically meet once a month usually the last thursday of every month this thursday I'm you know with this being November next week in december that will change a lot of a holiday yeah but we we almost always meet once a month and it's almost always on Thursday okay well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down well I very much

appreciate it thank you

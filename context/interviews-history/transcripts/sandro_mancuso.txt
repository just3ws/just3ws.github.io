hi it's Mike here again and software craftsmanship North America I'm sitting here with Sandra Mancuso Mancuso excuse me um Sandra and I interviewed last year ah it senator was one of the first interviews I ever did with you tastic or amongst the first and he runs the London software craftsmanship group or affiliated with with the team that runs the software craftsmanship group but

when I first sat down to interview you last year I was I had just launched idea of you tastic and it was just basically focus only on user groups and now this year it's grown to be used groups and tech conferences and then also the people that that are interesting that speakers authors foss developers and community influences which is my wallet card for people that are interesting mom

you know in it sounds like you know London suffer craftsmanship a group is also wrong you know so what I've been doing is grown in what you've been doing sounds like from what you described is grown quite a bit what what is the state one year on of London software craftsmanship yeah I think that when I spoke last year we had about four hundred and twenty members one year

later we are checked this morning I thing that we have 860 yeah and also us here we were your 20 figure out how we would deal with 400 that's really good for ya 800 and then little of a sudden thing went out of proportion so he tried to have more meetings we decided I think that I said that last year that our plan will should have more meetings instead of making our meetings bigger right

because you say bigger ones that mean for example our roundtable meeting it was limited to 35 people but we have 4gb on the waiting list okay so that's actually 70 people you said you have 30 that attend and f 44 yeah and so there's always this massive waiting list in the meetings that you were running and so it was clear to me that either would make the meetings bigger or have more

meetings right and we chose the latter how many meetings you have one so now even five meetings a month home care and we decided to make them very different from each other another thing that we noticed is was that not every person feels comfortable he not hands-on session or not every person feels comfortable on a group discussion or in a social environment so he wanted to

provide different types of meetings ending evilly in the morning so he could satisfy the majority partner it's the only way or another so he's trying to respond to what the needs of the group are intended to provide different forums formats you work for different that could include everyone they make view at least once alone yeah there is a meeting that they feel very comfortable to come

along so that it was and one thing that he decided to do is we kept the promise of the first year to never have any technology specific meeting so every single vision that we have even their hands-on sessions they're always always language agnostic oh really so sorry you your focus truly on techniques not it necessarily odd this is Ruby this is JavaScript yeah another has a very rich

ecosystem of communities like Chicago mean does so every time that we feel the urge of running your Java session there is a java community for that so the Iraq that to the java community orchard will be community but in the craftsmanship community I don't want to alienate a single member I think that regardless which language they use regard which level seniority in her they

should feel welcome to come along it makes it harder for the nonce maybe the hands-on session but that that's what we'd started to do it has been very successful and so when you have you obviously the group is getting a little bit older now in one of the things I've heard about is from other organizers is how to keep its people have been in the group longer their experience level

increases so a lot of times the topics are a little more entry level so they lose interest and move on but how do you deal with that in such a large group that's a very interesting question because I remember one once we ran our hands-on session then we went to the pub as we do in England every session so these guy came along and said I found this session today very easy right and I

said to him the session was not easy you made it easy for yourself because you came to the session with your default toolkit didn't use that so for example if it was easy for you to do in c-sharp why haven't you done that enclosure or why haven't you used a different framework you know so there's always something you can be a beginner absolutely so so if he's something that

you know so there's no point in doing it so do something different challenge yourself the session is there as a structure for YouTube I do whatever you want you can talk with the cows retreats nex-7 and reflects a muscle that you don't use very often basically if you've done the the game of life 100 times in Java start to a new culture you're right right starting doing

so push ourselves so so I always say that to people and I think that doing that then they're finding with these mentality and then everything is up there and last year if you did a few different things you had a described that you were showing me on list what what did you where did that go how's that pensive yeah it's fine to have a global mailing list for author the

community organizers that we met here at the cna Europe he didn't work out well yeah no one contributed including ourselves yeah so I joined it and then within a few weeks I was in I I have to say the what kind of it wasn't there's nothing wrong with the format while i should say nothing for me there's nothing that anybody did wrong at least consciously or or intentionally it was

just that I was in a place myself and I think a few other people were were social and having a man list I felt kind of wrong because it was like it was a close thing was it was almost like feeling like oh this is just for the organizers and there's like why don't we just doing the open in today's oh hey so you know I don't think I think this is no slight anybody just it just wasn't

natural feeling yeah I think that it was an attempt to bring people all of us together right didn't work so that means that this year we need to figure out something yeah 22 to do it but we need to integrate we managed to do that well in Europe but we don't use any tools but we are very close to each other but still there is this big gap between the teasing us and quinceaneras we are not

aware of the communities in u.s. program and you guys are not to see in Europe source mothers there's even in the u.s. sirs and there's gaps even even within the same geographic region or gaps it's a little bit more insular and that does bring up you were working with a few different groups I remember that there was a German II group and a pair of I believe a Paris craftsmanship Paris

software presidential group no do you know where where they are absolutely that's what we decided to do for our second year because we had quite good first year and we thought that it could do more and do more mate that we wanted to see more consumption communities in Europe and I was starting around going to many conferences speaking confidence credit stuff and every single conference

that i was talking i was saying i want to go back home and knowing that at least one of you in the audience you want to start a cosmic community here right and I and for my surprise before interested and it came to me and then we shared ideas that we told them how they how we were doing what we were doing and then we kept this contact going on emails and helping them and and they all

these communities were formed in me in Europe very collected rocks because that's how the seed was planted by us right and then there is this conference in Germany this doctor craftsmanship conference in Germany that's been running for two years and they are this year they reserve some of these places for their communities in Europe also we could get together so the shoulder was

intentionally we're gonna we're going to keep some space shoppers we can bring people so they opened a few spaces for some of the communities in Europe and then they open to the general oh wow that's very cool so it's it's very clever to them very much hey we're all in this together I'm sorry let's let's take care of each other it's awesome so so yeah so now I think that in Europe

because we know each other we go to same conferences week the communities they were creating the same model so we are far more well connected well thanks again for another pleasure and hot love for hopefully we'll catch up again next year absolutely thank you

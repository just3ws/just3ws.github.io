hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here where else comp 2014 absent here with coraline hunky who gave a talk called artisans and apprentices thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me before us so please tell me a little bit about your presentation sure I've been involved with onboarding new developers would bring new people into our field for a number of years now

through internships your training through education and letting the teacher's assistant and I really think that it's one of the most important problem so we have to solve right now as technologists is how to bring new people into our community while preserving our community values and making sure that they have the appropriate resources to become effective and happy with their

careers okay yeah cuz I i I'd worked with the talent down by groupon and so I'm familiar with some of what you're talking about some of those things that you're dealing with but when you're on boring an employee can be a huge indicator of whether they're gonna drop right and I think actually even before they come into their first job the work that we do as a community to prepare

them for entering the workforce whether they go through boot camp programs they go through a CS program or if they're self-taught the way that we present ourselves to them we establish a baseline for what our expectations for them are I think that's something we have to be very delivered about so when you say expectations I talking about strictly technical or maybe cultural or

bowls if it's absolutely those are cultural road for things that bring us to a particular open source community with a me Ruby or Python or what have you is the the image of the community portrays and the way that it lives the values that are professes to hold dear if we're not very deliberate about passing these values on that culturable road and the things that we love about

community won't really go away so things like roles comp having the mocha asking policy those are important things or where is our maybe I'm drifting a little bit from or are they important lessons to people who are apprentices or are these coming to rest conferencing Wow we all kind of has this thing that's obviously even if it's subconscious it'sit's imparting

that this is important to actually I never made that connection before but I'm really glad you bring that because I do work a lot with conferences and with people who work with conferences establishment codes of conduct what these are in my talk I talked about the fact that a boot camp situation where your pee you don't work for 12 weeks and you repay them twelve thousand dollars

that draws from the very privileged but the people who can afford to not have a wage for that I'm moving to 4 12 grams you don't have families to support and so on and I think that that self select people who are of a privileged class and in order to attract people who are different from the majority of software developers people who are maybe from outside of your community outside of

your network it's important to signal to them that they're welcome and I think codes of conduct is one of their one mechanism which you can signal to women minorities and people of color and people in the LGBT spectrum that is the safe place and that they're welcome and that there are consequences for people who violate the community norms so you're you're here and you're presenting

Admirals confidence so that sounds like you okay you do feel comfortable here and you feel like it's it's giving our positive vibe is this something you've seen our compasses adopting or is something that maybe some conferences are kind of a little i'm not going to do this could be no upset our core audience i absolutely have seen that that net play out that discussion play out and i

took the color comic pledge to a stride and put together late last year i will not speak at or attend a conference that does not have a comprehensive code of conduct okay i'm at a lot of people took that pledge the people who disagree with it or who don't think it's a big deal or not people as a comment is there for ya so I from somebody who's working in a community and I have a youth group or a

conference what are some of the things that I can do to be more where or ensure that I'm not even unaware of that excluding people i mean if I moved out of my my user group and it's all a bunch of middle-aged white guys is it just that Syria min or a Miami be doing something that how God become more aware of what I'm doing in evaluate whether or not the audience is just that's the

demographic come in or is there something I may be doing a barrier I think that is absolutely the first step is looking out at the people that you are sitting with and if they all look like you there's a good chance that you're suffering from that with the fact you have established relationships with people that you work with people that you socialize with it's not that you've

done something wrong is that you haven't done all the things that you could do to make your group inclusive and welcoming and one of the ways you do that is by promoting the fact that you are open and welcome you can reach out specifically to people that you know in the community who are you know people of color or women who are people in the LGBT spectrum who are not able I'd like you

are rich you have to them and making sure that they understand that you are open to their participation and you welcomed their participation it's an important first step but there are people who are much more well informed about the salvia I am I recommend going to geek feminism wiki and there are lots of room lots of resources their summaries of those cultures he feminism

wiki yeah you can scoot walking from this or might be and they have lots of resources and does that does having clean information for people rather abled and and yes okay yes okay yeah and you know going even beyond in the car wall sconce conference in a company where they're dealing with trying to recruit the most competent people how can they do you have any advice on how

they can work with within these states phone works at least one of the evidence that has been shown to be effective is removing names and all identifying information from resume so i think the man they're in studies that have shown that men and women are more likely to take resumes that belong to people with male sounding names for people who don't have

a name that sounds latina or European publisher would have it we tend to favor and pick people who remind us of us although a blind selection process is very good that solves a great waiting for pagan speakers or conferences so just topic yeah yeah and doesn't know it would be a good talk right exactly yeah and then you can like it further further down the process you'd say oh what is

this person done before and what other talks are they given and second is the right flavor for our conference if you the same true think your company like everything that you do as an employer the way that you post your dad where you close your jaw bad the sorts of events they sponsor the marketing materials you have a message where I'm at these are all expressions of your values your

culture is not a ping pong table it's not a foosball table for beer after work your culture is what you believe in as a group of people and how you express it yeah and it's it's also good you know I might fit into the the cultural class of the typical male but even when I see a ping-pong table at a company Heidi I have three kids right that's not appealing to me that's that's

immediately a barrier and I'd feel that between me and and i think there's also another thing that's a you know sure you know I had I'm not maybe not somebody who's experienced severe challenges culturally but I can extrapolate from thence ago I feel popular well maybe that other person who is not able to you know called the servers like that yeah might feel like oh they're not

comfortable coming to accompany that it's up on that for I think you don't something important today pytheas very very important my poor thoughtful and empathetic then can we try to for ourselves in another's position and not express for opinions about what that must be like but listen to and it's like yeah I'm and figure out a way to to advocate and be a good Ally it really

comes several thing yeah and you know we did go little bit off in the original yeah you're kind of one often into production collages well there but I so just to go back to artisans and enterprises what was the message to story that you were telling that talk sure on the period of time that we live in where we have market economies that are taking off where we

have periods in which people are moving from rural areas to city's population explosion an age of specialization is opposed to journalists all that happen before in medieval Europe and between the eleven twelve thirteen centuries so we are not in a unique position and the way that people then reacted to changing cultural and market archit and governmental forces can teach us a lot

about how we can react in a more effective way there are things that we did that they did better than we did you know if you were to print this in a guild you had health insurance essentially your master was required by Bob required by the legal agreement that you signed to provide you with health care with food with men room board and we don't do that for people at very

internal perfection now if you work for a start-up you're lucky if there's insurance right and again that self select people who can afford a church I don't need insurance right so so yeah that's interesting to think about how you know we like to think of as everybody for themselves or kind of thrown to the Wolves back in those days but it really wasn't I've not really

been hearing my life in Egypt that that there's there's cut for Eleanor the people have built the pyramids for slaves right and that they were tradesmen in there she and I kind of like the middle class even like lower middle class and they want and they built it they worked for period of time then they went back and then they had they were paid you know so you know we

think that were so civilized now but and that everybody back then was so uncivilized no its positioning not a linear progression nice a cycle yeah so I would thank you for taking the time came on sweetie I appreciate it I really appreciate the opportunity user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech munity fascinating conversations a

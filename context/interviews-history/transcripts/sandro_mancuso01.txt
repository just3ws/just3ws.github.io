user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations popera of information find out for yourself today at you classic calm hi it's Mike with you tastic I'm here at SEMA 2013 and I'm sitting down with Sandro and Q so who did the talk this morning

the craftsmanship a few years on thanks for taking that time to sit down in a sander a few years on it's kind of a funny theme for our interview because this is actually our third year of doing this an interview I've done more interviews with Sandro than any other human being which is three and what's what I find interesting is that you're continuing to be an active part and

you're also growing in the community you've come here to the first SCA and you were in the audience and now a couple years later you're up and doing a major presentation which I think it's very interesting to see somebody who's come up in the community and and your talk was about you know that we have this bubble the we you see our community is being big but that's only because

we're inside of it so you know you don't realize it but I mean you have more details I'll let you talk about those details about the numbers that you were and how you got how you came to the talk of craftsmanship a few years off yeah basically because of course as as you said like we when we are within the communities we think that many we don't have like big numbers like we have in

London for example what more than 13-hundred know so we think that craftsmanship is everywhere right but then as soon as you start looking at the size of the population of developers all over the world you see that you are tiny brain and also the way that we see ourselves is not exactly how it's being perceived from outside our little bubble and when we have guys for example I

didn't give the names I mean during the talk what do you have guys like del North had new words some some of the XP guys in London that as Brian saying his talker they are on pioneers of the extreme programming they are not part of our movement they they have their critiques and and and that's what made me rightly talk about these a few years on because

I think that we are not portraying the right image well having the critics I mean I don't know I just wonder if that's necessarily a bad thing there's there's that the old English thing of taking the piss off of someone that's the that a Dan North type person who is known to be a little bit more of a controversial questioner of why you're doing things I mean is it is it bad for

us well I I speak to them quite often and we exchange a lot of like we're talking person we sing a lot of emails recently I set the Fed me would like for almost two hours it's not bad like it's actually very helpful as soon as you get all these criticism it's helpful because it helped us to realize our mistakes and what we can improve but but they are very smart

people and they in theory should see what we see but they don't and I think that is our fault so I think that we should fix that because they are just like two voices but remember that normally people don't go out there and say what they think right so for me when I see one person saying that thing I imagined another thousand feel and also I mean I did an interview with Dan and

he talked about how he created this this idea of the bdd which has now become Dogma and I thought it was funny of these ants a dogmatic but what he's put our to is dogma and then I think about it even when I think was Charles Barkley said I'm not a role model and both of those positions get taken wrong or get because there's such phone on people that both of their positions get

taken out of context the BDD for Dan was an idea that he put out and he wanted to talk about and have conversations but people have turned that into a rule it's been with Charles Barkley people took what he said and said no if we're supposed to be a role model what he was saying is I don't work the not that I he wasn't he was against anybody ever looking at him it was just that he said

don't that you should be your own role model I made you find your role models and in your in your own life in that people look at what a Dan North says who are in the craftsmanship movement maybe looking at it and the first exposure might be his criticism and because they've already attached to something he said am I not giving a fair shot yeah but but I work with some some very good

developers and not all of them like to associate themselves do the cross motion movement and and there are some developers they are just not international speakers but they share some of the kids it's like I don't want the labor I don't like to be when people say that I'm not professional when I share the same values as you do I am as proficient as you are in the practices

that you train I just don't go out there and do certain things so but I don't want to be called like that I'm not a fan order I'm here I just don't treat it as a religion and if I find a different practice and we use it and I think that I've seen more and more ethnically got a lot of people joining the cross worship movement but more and more some people now are

looking at it differently and I think that it's our fault I think that we are not reports writing what we see so well going into this image that people have with the craftsmanship and then tying that into the user group community you know a little while but over a year ago Justin Searles posted a article about that we're we shouldn't be writing a

language specific we should be writing for creating user specific language specific communities that we should be thinking more polyglots or craftsman being a good way to approach building a community but if you're if we're dealing with this criticism of the craftsmanship community and people seeing that brand is being made there if you go off and create a craftsmanship community people

might write that off entirely because they associated with this negative now I mean I know that the the craftsmanship group in London is pretty big but have you dealt with anybody who's come to it and either had preconceptions or had a resistance or criticism that wasn't based on don't observations but somebody else there was one guy that definitely a craftsman and he left our community and

when he left I was so why is that and then we spoke to him and he said like you know I don't really like the way that he's being portrayed anymore I think that I joined for a reason I love doing the Cathars and coming and joining and sharing with people but I'm not sure if I want to keep associating myself with them so many some of the process of leaders going shouldn't

confident saying certain things I'm not sure if I want that on the other hand I'm not saying that he's one person or two people I think that he's all about it in like like you said BDD started with one idea it moved to different ways agile had one ideology in there but like it was portrayed in many different ways by many different people as the thing grows many different people have

different interpretation and then they will tell other people that you have different protection and that keeps going and going and going and until the message is exactly so such a date I remember because I were to put a insolvency before where we used to sell agile projects right and we reached the point where we didn't as a marketing strategy

or speaking chiffons we wouldn't use the word agile anymore because there were so many companies resistance to the whole and agility or agile I said let's say everything that is good about the giant talk about all the principles but just not mentioning the net right just yeah don't say that word so and I think that in a way I don't

think that we are as bad the way that I would say I just don't want to be there I'm just trying to raise the flag right now that I've seen some people having a very different understanding people from outside the grow social community having a very different understanding that we have from the inside right so before we get to a point where when people make some craftsmanship said no I don't want

that we need to do something so one of the points she had towards the end of your talk was about starting communities and the gia is some experience you were with the Java community and that was a very large presentation I mean a very large population of in the order of a thousand plus and now the craftsmanship is a thousand plus over the last couple years of being involved in these

communities is there any particular advice you might want you to give to somebody who's considering starting community or just wishes they had a community in their own neck of the woods to people is a community right that's how we started to people in a pub right so start simple I know that for some in us there's all the thing of providing food and having a sponsor for this

no you what you need the Starbucks hub or your office like if you work for a company that are willing to to let you use the office from 6:30 in the afternoon at you right that's what you need no need for the people people with the comity right right so you need a space that can be a public space like a Starbucks invite a few people and start then keep it simple keep the all the

overhead because we are all busy we all have kids and families and work a lot and travel and also stuff so remove all the overheads what it means make the meetings very simple to organize it start with a round table with an open space people come along and decide what do you want to talk about there's no preparation for that you just need to find one spot that's and it needs to

have a read them so that means that for example we are gonna have our round table with our loop discussion whatever name you want to give to that every second Tuesday of the month in these Starbucks or in these company so as soon as you have a rhythm the members of your community they can plan themselves right so ok I have a meeting in two weeks time so I will move my thing so I can attend

that meeting so that's important and as I said for example use our website like meetup calm example they handle all the registration notification like they they send you reminders that they're there there's the meeting yeah so they think they know who is coming who is not if you have a waiting list they handle that for you so all these things that you would struggle to do just pay put some

money in there this one a from your pocket and because all these things are reasons for you not to be sometimes I feel remove all of them it's much neater so that does that that's what I normally recommend and try to make the meetings fun don't focus on throwing your community life just focusing having quality meetings because the people

coming they will bring other people if the meeting is good but don't focus in advertising everywhere yeah I think I could give like the bone forever talking things that you can do so so I'm here to say pick a topic pick a place because schedule meetup.com and just keep doing it yeah and keep it simple at least at the beginning because like the devices like

these those are advices for people starts in a vernian community but there are many other things that we can talk about as the club the community grows because like that the problems changed everything changed because what what you listened and it in a way you've alle dates I've been doing a little bit saw a lightning talk I didn't get to do it today but called teach yourself

beginning community in 24 months you know it's a play on 24 hours but you do those five things you you pick a topic you pick a place because schedule you just get it out there and I say meet up there calm but also that means Twitter and Facebook print page tell people tell people tell me it's all people and then and make it available that's why I meet up.com

and then repeat it but give it time you know don't say oh we did it one month and nobody showed up so you know you know and some of that is self limitation that I expected I have to have five people other group so you said two people talking that's already yeah you have collaborate I mean of communication already and you're sharing but give it you know a little bit of time for you to

get into flow of it to understand it to start to allow the the benefits to and a lot 14 grow and give people a chance to schedule there is one thing that is very important that I saw that it's very strong community the community for example I would we made a common commitment in London that every single meeting we have would be language agnostic we don't run any

meeting that would alienate any person but I know other communities where they run there's technology specific meet meetups so for example the in one month do you come here and we are gonna do airline the other month we're gonna do something else this is very cool however you want in 8 people because like if for example not interested in an airline that means that if you take two months

for me but from my last me for to my next one next when I come back and as long as you don't choose I don't know something we have third month that's also so that was our phone so we wanted to run some technology Civic but the problem is that you are unite people so we preferred not to do that so everything that we do we don't alienate anyone so all our hands-on sessions are

we give Coty's we give problem but it can be done in any language so we always focus and bring your own language do whatever you want so that's very interesting because here so you're staying away from here's a specific tool and here's more core concepts to think about ideas patterns we're going to talk about the singleton pattern and it doesn't matter let's try to find some of

the ways you can get yourself into a bowl can Ruby or ANSI whatever you do and then maybe even those two loops can then talk wow you know we have the singleton object in just exactly so so we keep the discussions at a very high level that everyone can can discuss or even write code and the technology CP I don't know how different cities will be but London is special because every

technology has a community there so if they want to know more about JavaScript they go to the JavaScript community if they want to know more about hospitai go to the hospital community and so on so forth so we leave all these things to the local community the specialized communities and I think they're extremely value but in the processor community we prefer

not to do what some some other communities do because I probably wouldn't be interested in to go to certain meetings and that means that it would take a long time for me to go to a meeting again right and then the whole point of being a community gets lost thank you very much for taking the time stomach plastic sheeting my pleasure maybe see you next year

absolutely you do the keynote Thanks user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today yeah cute plastic calm you

hi i'm mike with you tastic here at Windy City rails sitting with Ryan singer who has been around pretty much since the there before the rubber walls of rails community thanks right for taking the time obviously you've been around with the rails in the Ruby community for a very long time I you know super spark when I come look for some perspective on and what you've seen

how the community is grown in it to its its inception through to where it is now today where we have people who are now just coming in years later starting to learn and adopt it and it's growing beyond what I used to be in you know different conferences you've spoken at what what have you seen in the community over over the years well well I actually don't think it's changed so much except

for the fact that in the beginning it was clearly an insider group of you know people at the edge right yeah and early adopters yeah like early adopters more but from my standpoint I'm not like part of the core team or you know I just kind of see more what's going on tonight the cool thing for me is that I see the same kind of people actually coming to conferences even today with how many new

faces but new basis but same kind of spirit you know like somehow it seems to attract people who are practical who really like to get results you know which we tend to somehow it seems that the crowd is usually people who are motivated by progress more than arguing about what you shouldn't do or something like that you know and it's been cool to see that as a consistent factor so more

of the make things work then oh how can I obsess over this tree healing is this parenthesis in the right places on it and but as far as like the engagement from if you ever have you ever spoken at any user groups you would compare that again either really you know actually it's the rails community is a special case for me yeah because i usually have been invited to

talk at like design centered things or user experience things and stuff like that because that's kind of my niche as a design and product person and the rails events I've always been able to go and talk to the technical audience about other stuff right about products or user experience or design or whatever and that's also been like a really cool side of this community that they're

interested in that yeah and that's one of the you saw hmm chick was talking about earlier is say he runs Ruby Madison and I UX mad in the difference of talking to more designing a little bit more artistic bent group versus a group that's more nuts and bolts yeah i'm giad kind of change i like talking to the programmer groups so much more i have to say because you can use it's

kind of like I get to have fun because I can use all these abstractions yeah and all these comparisons to coding concepts okay like you can get together with a bunch of programmers and you can talk about factoring and it means something yes but if I get together with a bunch of designers I would have to spend a half hour to try and describe a factoring means okay but it really

concerns them because you could make even your HTML in such a way where if you make it one way it's going to be impossible to change if you make it another way it's going to be really easy to move this and you keep that where it is and that sort of thing you know yeah and so it's been our vocabulary I think actually the the programming the thing is that ultimately everybody at the

party has to be able to speak basic programming concepts right and the design world is still I think a little bit immature in the sense that it hasn't totally gotten closer to the programming world we still have a lot of designers who are more concerned with the style and they're they're happy to make a wire frame and then give it to a program lanoy and with the programming community

you can just dig into the details so much more because at the end of the day we're all making software so it's really helpful to have a common vocabulary and some of the same abstractions whether it's it's HTML markup or it's it's a it's a ruby outfit or the harmonic design but it's still it's making a thing yeah yeah and it's still cold right it's just different approaches

towards this yeah and you know software designers have been struggling for deck with how to do it in the best way yeah you know and how to deal with all these different kinds of complexity and a lot of designers are doing really good stuff and at the same time they haven't as a culture been fighting with complexity and talking about these things it would be because they they are able to work on

it and then they hand it off so they don't necessarily have to deal with living with the ramifications of his eyes I can't think a lot of it has to do with the tool set before got some ice being poured the party is getting prepared yeah yeah it's good ambience party preparation in the background before before rails came around I it was really really hard for a designer to get

involved yeah because I mean like take objective-c for an example like as a designer it's really hard to get into the code they're right you know it's like what what is going on here but when rails came around it was like you had all these web designer people who weren't programmers but they could at least do a little bit of design I mean they could they could do HTML you know

and now because they could do HTML they could get into the code base because rails just has erv templates right and it was like this open door for them to get involved it wasn't like learn some crazy you know learn java or learning dr. C or whatever it was just like hey put your template here and then like here's a little bits of Ruby sprinkled in and it created that I think it

created the conditions for designers and developers to work together and that you actually don't find that in like net or Java or jet to see because the borderline between the parts of specifying the interface and the way that the code is written it's just like such a big separation you know and it doesn't reminds me of a kind of a moment from a few years ago when he were

presenting also at Windy City rails and he mentioned some of the ballots on your perspective on hammer and you never turned out to be a little bit of a dated perspective because but still it was it I think we're still relative to Point and I it something I've also recently experience dealing with the designer where they speak HTML yeah and I'm trying to ask them to Hamill and it's

just thats gobbledygook to them yeah I mean one of my arguments at the time was that I don't see if you're gonna rate create a hurdle somebody if you want the designer to be involved and then but then you're taking them further away from what they're used to there should be a good benefit there you know and some people see a lot of benefits and Hammel yeah but I would be

saying is there a benefit for the designer because they're the ones that has to bear the cost right right wrapping abundance trying to translate those and that's a question to make on an individual basis it used to be that in the early days of hamill if i remember right you couldn't they actually had a kind of anti they had a philosophy against putting logic in your

template being able to run arbitrary ruby code and I think that that freedom is really important fortunately it turned out that eventually they relaxed about that now you can do whatever you want in there you know and that's opened it up now it's I think basically personal preference if you see an advantage of doing it or not yeah and I think it is one of the things that's

more programmer friendly not necessarily somebody who's going to try to tweak the design and make it beautiful and make it work yeah but but you know I think that that right now is it's kind of a symbol for the kind of the divide of the mentality between somebody's coming from a design perspective to a conference that there they have a toolset that they're used to working with and

developers are more likely to say what new tools and I work with mm I don't want to how much it's gonna be better because i have a new tool right exactly and i just wanted you know in a conference he really wants to get that ice there does it yeah but I I'm dealing with a conference I've just I've just drawn a blank but hey wait thank you so much for should take 90 watts and stupid

Austin my pleasure now and speaking of when you sit your ass absolutely thanks

hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at railsconf 2014 I'm sitting here with our standing here with opee Fernandez who led a panel on the future of rails jobs thank you for taking the time to speak with me on your panel what what what do you mean by the future of rails jobs and who was on the panel sure of well Alan Grant the co-founder of hired was one of the sponsors sponsored the the panel

okay his friend of mine and we talked about what we could contribute to the conference and it seemed like a good idea that you know given the amount of people that certainly would be here looking for jobs we're looking to hire people to have a discussion doing kind of a frank discussion about what is the future of our industry you know of our job market and where's it going so in

addition to Al and I invited Jeff castamere who has been involved in a lot of training initiatives and his his latest thing is uh during school term school yeah he's at j33 on Twitter yeah I invited Corey Hanes who's like legendary and you know helps to train people and software craftsmen get a ball around the world to global day of color tree yep enjoy trade I thought you would

be so dition given how much talk there's been about TDD right hop up like that and and you know he also trained the blood people on ECT over local company in Chicago and chat by thousands of a friend and fellow author and add some Wensley pro Ruby series and he runs soft bot and hired people and does apprenticeship so I thought between the you know the the bunch we would have

some good perspectives on where this markets going and you also have a history with the worldwide walk series yeah yeah I'm editor of that someone sleepover b-series my latest book the rails for way is coming out in print in a couple of weeks it was a bit of a company pub you know I mean that's that's a lot of people have been involved with it with the Ruby and rails

for yeah definitely and I have you know I used a Stone House Rock sold it a few years ago but they're you know we have we had 35 people plus yeah and in Chicago yeah Miami exactly yeah Jacksonville so so a lot of a lot of experience hiring and you know most of us are old timers in the the Ruby and rails world so you know as we're coming up on 9 10 years late it's a good time

to look and see okay where we at and that was one of the big topics so what were some of the lessons or what we're kind of materialize during the panel it was it was interesting to hear the panelists talked about where where they see the most expansion and I would of course be kind of like on the junior end writes a lot of folks pouring into these training programs it's a lot of folks

coming out of that and then getting hired at the shops where you know we hope that they're going to get adequate mentoring and be able to work with with folks that have more experience and then be able to to get their skills up to where they need to be because I am some of them are having you know anywhere from a few weeks of training to a few months of hands-on training and we had

some back and forth about you know kind of what what do you need you know to crack into the industry so it was overall the theme positive towards this is this trend or was it more of a kind of like I think it was I think it was attending it was positive with some notes of coffee sounded you know and some some notes of wanting those of us in position to exercise leadership to

make sure that this doesn't become a glutton I'm the sense of driving them wages but in the sense of you know potentially affecting negatively affecting the quality level projects you know resulting more rescues needed and things like that that was really the only you know kind of negative area of conversation we also talked about you know how much the freelancers make them

and how much do you know to regular hires make and how to hire them and advice for getting noticed by employers and things like that him up as well and I mean I also wonder if there's the brisket restitution of forget for a whole bunch of hundreds of for thousands of new ed developers are coming out and they know Ruby on Rails and they go into a project and then the

approach manager doesn't stand that they're just juniors there's this is a bad name for Ruby on Rails and maybe you develop me an aversion to it just because of God false signal yeah I don't know I did there's a sense of that could happen but you know I have a feeling that a lot of these schools and training programs that you know they're helping with the placement they're pretty active

something that right now that the jeff has definitely spoken to me personally about but came up a little bit in the panel were they they're sending invitations you know correctly but for the folks are getting into it you know there just seems to be no limit to the domain up right you know so a lot of these folks are coming out of these programs and getting hired you know

fifty sixty seventy thousand dollars oh it's how I mean the market that you're going into yeah and depending on where they're coming from that could be a huge I know one person I'm metric was from twenty thousand dollars to you somewhere in that range idiots like you never dream attic impacts I know a lot of persons life yeah and we also talked about you know the embers of that which

is when when you do have experience and you start making you know with into the six figures how it ramps off you know we mentioned that we don't know two people who has employees in rails jobs are making like two hundred thousand or more right and how it's interesting that that space between 100 and 200 the thousands tend to lose significance just because it employers offering say 150 versus 130

right it doesn't make that much of a difference if the culture and other software factors are not there and and one of the things I like about hired and one of the reasons that I like Allen and what he's doing there is that they get the money discussion out of the way first so that the employee can can focus on the other issues heard somewhere they have a period

whether certain amount of bacteria I'm tuning and the curate the you know you can sign up for hired but basically they curate you or they have on their to set a minimum bar and then the employers you know decide who they want to pursue but they have to put the terms up front right you know so at that point if I'm looking for a job my understanding is that I can decide who has met my terms

right off the bat so that I don't go through a long interview process and then get to the stage where they make me an offer and it's like oh I can't work for a hundred thousand dollars in San Francisco that's possible right right whore or whatever you have whatever the case Judy yeah at the very very frustrating so they invert that and I think that's why they're there dunes are

long they go the carmax of job placements yeah sticker price is what you're gonna pay I think you'd be happy with them yeah sure yeah you know just going back to some your early history with with Ruby on Rails oh yeah I'm just seriously you know you've written a number of books and then I'm going see reason and with a pro Ruby series how did you get started with with teaching

and being because it seems to be a theme inside of every community is a difficult each and they they bring others up home in the early days did you get involved in in publishing I mean I got pulled into it through through my activities and blogging and I used to be someone who who had a well-read blog in Java world before me delete and then once I got into to Ruby and 2005 and became a

loud evangelist for it it attract a lot of tension and and back then that world was a lot smaller and it was a lot easier to get dialogues going and to you know you didn't have to get lucky with how good news in order for everyone to read your stuff is actually a lot easier to get hurt yeah I know let her take no noise I know what the pain of getting people have to watch each other

definitely it's a different it's a different world now but that said quality content always wins and what it's it's interesting to see the community of reinvent itself and kind of renew itself and what we're seeing here it's always just like the little tip of the iceberg granted you know when when rails come started out it was a really small iceberg and the

people on the tip you know where those of us that we're blogging and giving conference talks and stuff like that and everyone knew each other and it's funny to see how over the years the the community that's active and blogs and stuff like that the characters change and they more often they involve make off into other areas but stays kind of relatively the same size but what's been

really amazing to watch you know partly for me looking at the royalty checks and the size that they're getting is how big the rails community has gone I mean just hit the mainstream in our in a way that I think has exceeded our wildest dreams yeah really it is yeah that's a that's something that maybe those who were just participating in community might not see but being able to see like wow the total

numbers of people buying these books just it's growing it does the girl it grows every year and it just it goes and then you see you come to like this year's reels coffin you see like you know how many people are hiring for else jobs and who they are and like companies continuing to switch over from dotnet and Java deployments and just redoing entire devouring Department via tearing

infrastructure out and starting over and it's it's it's heartening to watch that the community keeps growing yeah and now if you're on the other end of the spectrum of your years of publishing are you looking at the change in the way books are published and in the early days have been paperbacks and tomes but now it seems like things are moving towards ebooks is that something that

you're experiencing or moving towards it's still you know if you want to write a book your best bet is to start by self publishing your new book but you know keep them keep in mind traditional publishers are happy to sign any book authors and a lot of times we'll just take your ebook and you know maybe with some editing or something you know or whatever publish

it as a print book and there is still a lot of value and be published with the prestigious whole thing house I like actions wisely O'Reilly or Wiley you know where you know it gives you credibility and that's what it's all about yeah yeah you know how people will laugh that automatic trust oh I know that publisher just get the look exactly I'm gonna get this book a chance you

know it really does wonders for your career on them custom to that you know it is once you get a book published people start looking to as an authority yeah well again thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me okay to my pleasure thanks likes user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations

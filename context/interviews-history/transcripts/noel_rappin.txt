I am I come here again at Windy City rails with no wrapping hey really no Liz I is a also another one of those people that have been around pretty much forever inside of the Ruby community and mentoring yeah and I love particularly here in Chicago and you know he often teaches you often teach our workshops as well as um as speaking at a conference and just kind of like you know the

differences between speaking and teaching a workshop at a conference well yeah yeah I think there's their differences of scale you know you go to is to differences really one is the scale of it when you're doing a regular conference presentation you're speaking in front of you know 150 200 people in a large room for not as much time and those workshops tend to be around a

dozen people and they tend to be more intimate in scale and you have a real longer time to interact with people and also the workshops typically are people who are specifically choosing to be in that room at that time it's an extra cost at the time it's a certainly time investment whereas a conference talk people are coming into the conference more than they're coming to see you in

specific so you know you have to maybe you a little bit more of a job of explaining why you're there and what's important to it the people that come to a day-long workshop itself selected they already think this is important because they're spending it down and I mean I've heard people kind of describing the person who's standing up in front of the audience teaching as being kind of the

school mentor I mean I see excuse me the school teacher standing up in front of an audience lecturing the audience of the students versus you know the hands-on person who's it was down with the student teaching a lesson well yeah I mean the workshop is effective generally in proportionate to the extent that I'm not you know if I'm and I'm as guilty of

this is in teaching as I am anything else if I'm spending the whole time talking you know that's a that's maybe not the most effective use of the time if somebody is asking a question then even if it is sort of a digression than you know for the course of that question at the very least i'm answering something that is of interest to somebody in the room guys they've asked

it but even better is when people have the opportunity to really try something and have questions that emerge out of their experience as they're working through something rather than trying to impose an experience on them which is something that I could stand to get better at and I a doctor also it leads me to think about how an open laptop in a class is a good thing an open laptop

during a session I you know listening to you Steve cloud next talk which was very young it was a very thoughtful presentation and seeing all the laptops open you know I think there's a lot you know there are there are there are different scales of that you know I'm looking around and I'm seeing people who are their laptops are open but they're taking notes so they're using a mind map

software and really try and engage the material while the presenters doing it or people are you know checking Twitter those are those are different levels of engagement and and but you can often tell from the other side of the laptop you but if you can't see the laptop screen whether somebody's really engaging with what you're trying to say yeah I saw a lot of code and screw you

always yeah that you know one thing definitely a lot of people a lot of people are still working on kind of so I mean is that ever been something that's been distracting for you on stage or um it's only distracting as a presenter in a large room it's generally distract not distracting unless they're distracting other people usually or unless there's such a critical mass of people that have

checked out that but but that doesn't usually happen yeah in a small room it's much more obvious if a couple people are checked out and and that can be distracting if you're you know if you're if you're doing a workshop to even like 12 people and and two or three of them have maybe they have valid reasons you know maybe something genuinely important came up

but there they've checked out like that that stands out that's right in a way that it doesn't necessarily do you ever have you ever had that happen where you've been up on a stage and seen a bunch of our laptops opening up and you're like maybe I should offer you know um in a short form presentation then I don't I don't normally have a leeway really to do that necessarily in

a small room i'll usually joke about it you know i'll make it make it obvious that or make it clear that i can kind of tell that they've checked out a lot of times in a workshop situation um there's two ways to look at it i mean i could be not doing a good job they could be not paying attention like i don't necessarily know you know these you know if people come voluntarily it comes in

the room and they think the best use of their time is to sit in the room and write code maybe it is I try not to get done this enough that I try very hard not to take it personally except to the extent that I try to think about what I might not be but what I might be doing not to not be serving in person and you know speaking more about that because you've done so much teaching you or you

know what you were a teacher before or I'll be taught at the college level knowing a little bit only only the extent that was a graduate student but I did run some classes is have you seen any over the years have you seen any kind of an evolution in the audience dynamic and it kind of not that I could say over time and I think that the regional conferences have gotten you

know for bigger and more structured um that there's you know even just but even just the idea of having training days as something that's a right your thing is really only a couple years oh it's probably a little too soon to think of that as something that's evolving I think that what has happened in the Ruby community is that the the regional conference the regional

conferences have become more established and and more professional and sort of better organized just in general and I think and larger and I think that that has that has more of an effect on on on what happens then the community changing over time capsule thing yeah said the one thing with it kind of what makes me think about what the structure is is it people are too much on a per-user word

track to describe you know a series of presentations but and the people tend to move on tracks and that they are almost like a school that I mean if you think about it it's almost like you go to class then you have a break and then you go to the next class and then they belong right and that's that's you know there's a limit you know I think that in a single track conference like this one

you know there's it's not quite a school but I think of it as kind of like a chance as much as anything that's a chance to hear perspectives that you wouldn't otherwise here like I'm not normally going to maybe to my detriment I'm not normally going to spend 45 minutes thinking about philosophy as it relates to my work but it's a really interesting perspective to have and now

maybe I might seek it out I think that that you know lecture which is what these day long conferences tend to be has its strengths and weaknesses staging tool but it's a really good way to introduce each reduce things it's a really good way to get a sense that something might be interesting to you to explore you know I really like there have been a couple

talks today and yesterday that have had some practical things that I can you actually start using right now right and I think that that's really great too yeah I think it's nice to the conference to have a mixture of the practical and the theoretical yeah I think that yeah okay well thank you very much snow for taking a tiny bike alright and we'll have a link to your book to go great

thank you

hi I'm Mike with you tastic here going to SCA this morning I'm sitting down with my climate who runs the Utah software craftsmanship Ruby thought when he founded the group um thanks for sitting down with me what are you guys doing out in Utah with software craftsmanship so we started the group in February 2011 because me and two other guys the two other guys have become less

involved with the group since then but I just saw that there were other communities being organized in different cities and so what I did is some the main soft for craftsmanship mailing list i sent out is anybody else in Utah's and would eat or anything like this and found three or four other like-minded people that were interested in starting up the community and so we kind of took

that core and and built on it are you in salt lake or so the for those not familiar with utah there's the salt lake county and there's the salt lake valley of the utah valley that are kind of adjacent to each other and that area along there including davis county known as the Wasatch Front and so it's kind of a big metropolitan area big a lot of stuff herbs and stuff like that so we

meet between salt lake in utah county is kind of in the middle so we can draw for both areas but it's a city area because I've noticed that that does influence attendance and the way the community works is whether or not that's a suburban versus like a strong area or I'll or centralized metropolitan areas that it's a sprawling area I mean we're talking people come from probably 40 50

minutes south of where like they live or even 50 minutes south of where the meeting is and some people come as far as an hour from the north oh wow so I'm upon people from a pretty large area yeah we have considered doing two groups splitting it apart but we haven't quite reached the critical mass think is necessary the island of the split the group and have them both

succeed independently sir how many are you seen at a meeting kind of so over the last couple months we've actually seen a pretty big uptick in the number of people coming we're sitting like 20 25 people that's good for a for a non centralized metropolitan area yeah well we're using an area that's a location that's used for a lot of other user groups so people are used to traveling

at least a little bit also it's already kind of in a cemetery people know that's the area go for user groups yeah we use we've currently sponsored by neumont university who hosts the site their university its focuses on computer science degrees and they come kind of compress it into two and a half years okay anyway so they sponsor a lot of community events and like the Donna user

group meets there I think the Ruby user refused to meet there I don't know if they still do or not like Utah code camp has been hosted there so it's a place where people are pretty familiar with fucking so so they know so that I'm sure that helps with also letting people know about the group or is that it do you think that the fact that you're in this area it's already known for every groups

has helped you with promoting your group or has it it's made it easier to tell people where it is all kinds of people already know the location but it's but interestingly enough next summer that they're moving sites to downtown Salt Lake I'm currently they're probably about 15 20 minutes south of Salt Lake and so we're trying to decide what we're going to do yeah going forward sorry

well it'll stay there just how the history or move to the new location well they're going to close that location all so it's whether or not we move with them or we find somewhere else in the similar location just because it's kind of central or we split the group or whatever lot of displaying that decision is almost hospital and I I'm sorry I just dribbling the question I want to

ask if that happens sometimes but what I was really trying to get it is you said that there's there is a body of user groups that were that are in that area have you done any cross cross meetings with them any like oh you're talking about Ruby we want to do something about testing and Ruby can we do across me um we haven't really yet i come from the dinette community and so interestingly

enough i guess a lot of the initial people that that join the group or the dominant community people that i knew we struggled for probably six to ten months early on like every meeting it was like at the beginning of the meeting we do a check-in and we would say you know what's your name where you work what your primary language and then we come up with some goofy question like what's

your favorite candy bar or something yeah and that's quicker yeah and so consistently it was like C sharp C sharp C sharp done that C sharp and occasionally you have somebody from the Ruby community show up or somebody that did something else and but it was it was really hard because we were trying to be a Polliwog group whatever you want to be him

homogeneous and so over the last probably six months or so we've started to be able to pull in more people because we have some guys who crossover between like the dotnet world and like the javascript world over boiled and so we've and we've tried to coordinate maybe not directly but at least tried to get a lance before we started to get a landscape of where all the meetings were

in the month right to kind of make sure we were on a free knife yes you weren't competing right certainly how we were competing with the Ruby user group and that basically said no derby people were going to come right and so we we moved it I think twice before we settled on tonight that's actually going to its heaviest so you looked at the calendar and you try to figure have you spoken

with any of the other is your group leaders um I've talked to the doc net user group and we've had different people within a group kind of crossing some circuits I guess yeah go talk to the group's the communities that they're a part of but I haven't reached out specifically like I've posted stuff on their groups and stuff aren't having it do you use meetup how do you how do you

share your how do you share of your meetings how do people know when utah st meeting is um so we just use a Google Group oh um I'm talking to Sandra yesterday it sounds like we may be not to try something more I I guess I don't know meetup because most of the user groups in Utah predate meet up and all that stuff they all can have their own sites and our kind of it's not terribly

unified right there are a couple there is a site i think that it tracks a lot of the activities there's utah geek events which would be kind of a hub but yeah we haven't used me to maybe we should so we just use my movie right somebody down you Tokiko been so I'm going to check them well um yeah they are group that the core groups started was the one that

was organizing or is organizing your taco camp and then they organized a single Saturday and they've kind of tried to try to help organize different other communities they kind of backs between the different groups you can say okay that's this is what's trying to work out a schedule and um well it's more they're more about putting on events as opposed to use your groups

okay so like annual type events conference you know mini conference type stuff okay their community organized again one of the challenges they've had is that they come from the dominant community right n trying to reach out to you know the Java guy had some of the Ruby guys I'm just trying to pull the community together has been somewhat difficult because there is you know I

don't know for whatever reason there's a little bit there's a little different called kids just different culture yeah okay well thank you very much for taking the time stuff yeah thanks

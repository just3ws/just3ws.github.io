hi I'm Mike I'm with you tastic here at Chicago web conference I'm sitting here with Martin Atkins who's written the book I'll welcome to the music industry you're and he's also spoken at quite a few regional tech conferences ux mad medicine Ruby and today here at Chicago web conf one of the kind of interests well and also he's been in a few industrial bands you've played drums

with a ministry manage nails but then I drill a few few small bands for you for my youth haha you come to these technical conferences and you talk about the music industry what is it that you want to teach technical people about the music industry I think that that's kind of a good question one of the things I'm trying to do for me is expand myself so I mean I can do music business stuff I

can sit down with a band in half an hour that show them how to make an extra 60 thousand dollars in a year blindfold yeah you know music business has been my life then education became my world maybe six or seven years ago and i love that reaching out to younger and younger kids oh yeah you teach it to you at medicine nice nice immediacy to you but i also i guess but you're all over the

world in music business and entrepreneurial activities but i think that i think the more interesting question ok is more interesting to me anyway is how did initially UX madison reached out to me ok right which you don't for a programming conference of madison Ruby which is Ruby on Rails stuff that I didn't know these terms right six months ago I thought it was

super cool that they reached out to myself Clyde Stubblefield who's the funky drummer the world's most sample drama to come and speak to them the conference about programming water and I haven't seen that kind of openness the desire to be exposed to new things from the music business you know the music business you know i just did a heavy metal convention in calgary and it

was very cold than to have me basically a punk rocker come on talk to them but it would be the equivalent of what york's madison did would be for the calgary heavy metal music festival to have a baseball player or somebody from a cookery show yeah come and go this is what we do with spinach yeah so after learning some interesting things from dale carnegie about social media about

my dad social media stuff before there was social media learning from the Vikings learning from a contemporary music blues class in California the Woody Guthrie was actually kind of the first punk you know exposing myself to new and different random things it's how I've learned so that's why I want to come do this so it's like what am I here to teach these people nothing I'm here

it's a word slidell I think that some of the things I say about a band also applied to a brand you know in the same way that the band has to worry about their fans I mean you know I think that those worlds have crossed over now there are there are more fans of the iphone than there are fans of most bands right you know the you know technology is the new cool cause bad yeah you identified i

have an iphone it's it's a new starbucks right but i just spoke at the apple store last week yeah right and then I was nervous I was more nervous about that then sat by southwest in front of a thousand you know because it's the apple store oh we always so is it was the brand presentation that you're like I'm an apple in at an apple store yeah and and

I can tell people I'm keynote in here or do this on South American dinner and yeah yeah okay you know i'm going to be at the apple store room really yeah it's like it's like oh come on but is it is it because that just may be surprised to be like the apple store yeah like no apple is the new cool this week now it's now it's reached the zenith of its coolness it's downhill all the way that

yeah you know even Richard Branson says you know choose to be the underdog and Apple has been and now it isn't yeah so the scene is set for some underdog except Apple keeps buying all the underdogs don't they yeah and so with your with your goal of you learning by coming out and exposing so that's something I've agreed as I I didn't come into software developments as a child I

didn't grow up in it I started as 25 at a variety of experiences and I have to think that's flavored my approach to to what I do in micro is that something so seeking out those those experiences and challenges that are beyond work beyond your field is that something you encourage yeah well I wouldn't be here if I didn't speak in public and just you know unlike anybody else the first I

spent my life behind a drum kit on stage in front of any you think 15,000 people live television and but to stand without a drunk head just to talk to people my legs were shaking and you just keep practicing and doing that I started to educate by accident i went to columbia college chicago which is not far from him to get interns to help me promote a tour and i did a presentation for the

faculty and they said when can you start I can start I can take in terms with me now look what could you start teaching this island and I was like her and I had this slow-motion moment in my head and like this is ridiculous but what would I tell my children grab the nettle expose yourself to new opportunities so I said where does the class start yeah they're

like this Saturday that way is it an hour long plastic 27 hour long class oh my goodness and I just said screw it and I started doing it and as soon as I walked into the first class and then gave me the textbook i looked at the textbook it was written in 1962 and so I started to write my first book which is called toe smart and because of toast lot I've been to Norway five times like

not that that's a big deal but South America all I've traveled more as an author than I ever did as a musician and I traveled a lot for some musician and it was just because of exposing myself to an unexpected opportunity and and if I analyze the opportunity ho said here's an opportunity to teach I didn't even know that it was an opportunity to end up creating materials and writing a book

and ending up I'm just finishing off my third book yeah yes rhymes the path isn't clear it but suppose from iguodala the teacher surprising places right I mean that's the god from holiday inn he said you walk through the doors that are open Wow yeah it's very simple but it's it's profound as well that if you don't if you don't notice at the fortune favors the bold kind of thing with with

engaging students so and coming to a conferences if one of the things is because I'm my audience is mostly people who were technical people who are looking at technical topics and and wanting to learn looking at teaching a class of aspiring well I mean when when your teacher press are they aspiring is musician managers or they could be event managers I've had students go into

politics one of my label managers worked on the Obama campaign did the mayoral race in pittsburgh in houston and is now afl-cio some people want to manage venues they want to manage bands they want to work on a radio show or just be entrepreneurial using video i got some students have created a recycled fashion game show and clothes line combined they're just so that the other it's a

media school with a basis in recording motion capture videography but the EMV program is its entrepreneurial it can be anything but what the question was kept trying to stumble towards was talking to those types of people and a mindset that is i would imagine unique to their career path versus coming to a technical where you have a lot of developers and people are a little bit more very used

to that drum kit so to speak being in front of the laptop the workstation the thing that they interact with coming in teaching or sharing with with a technical audiences is a difference is there is a response difference yeah some of the laughs are easier a little bit just kind of happy to be here yeah and you know there's a few things it stretches me what my CSS gag you know so

i tried always trying to kind of find a way in so you know i know that these guys use CSS java ruby-on-rails so i made my CSS Miami I love that TV show the joke so if I can make this audience laughs with a programming junk yeah then that's that's my chops yeah I'm working on my chops and I'm opening a door when I was in Norway I i bought a t-shirt from from

the hotel lobby which had Viking rules on again and I thought this is great yeah you know and then I went on a thing I want them unattach it because the kids i was talking to didn't on Viking rules and they were a region so that was weird to me and then when I went to try and find a download of the Viking rules there was a bunch of programmers were like this stuff is great for programming

hello well you know so these these collisions of different worlds fascinate me there's a boxer called Joe Calzaghe II I think he's watch okay he's very difficult to fight because he was trained by his father who wasn't a fighter he was an improvisational jazz pianist right so Joe Calzaghe e is a warrior and an inspirational improvisational jazz penis so nobody

knows what he's going to do next last of all his thought process is so different well it's not on a track ever I go and low and then hi yeah he's like he's gone over that yeah that was it yeah so so well you start to hear things like that and so that that some of the program is here with their laptop and the thing and it's to me the poetry the art and the grooviness is somewhere in between that

world and another world you know yeah I think I think great accounting business accounting is more akin these days to poetry than numbers you know it's the stuff like I said it's the stuff that shouldn't work that's fascinating to me not the stuff that obvious does and and it's it's the risk of putting together a 12-person band with ours extra stuff like gua like like

anything huge and monstrous that is inspirational and and it's the stuff that costs the extra time and energy and money that weirdly from an accounting perspective makes it not possible but from a business perspective that's the one thing that sustains that business and enables it to grunt the thing that is the wild card the thing that is from the outside it's very interesting well

just one blessing before we wrap up is one of the things that's kind of come out today in my interviews is what about self-promotion not just self promotion of I'm grade I mean Yama you know you should hire me but the my group my tool it's good it's useful I'd like more people to use it look at it contribute to it is is that something that when you're dealing with a band and you're

trying to get people to listen to you kid that's only thing I can imagine it's like how you talk to people and sharing music with a new you don't you know you make organic homegrown blackberry jam you know and people you know people like your jab and once you have a fan club of 5,000 people in your jam bhulaiyaa fan club um he said oh hey you know I wrote a song oh my goodness yeah Brian the jam

guys wrote a song that was understand you love his jam what do you think of his music if you start with a robber song yeah I guess so this is about called i fight dragons from Chicago before they started they saw who are we I know budget nerds who like Star Wars so this they started going to Star Wars conventions and screenings and starting up a user group you know uh notes then

they started to make a song and then gave it to everybody for free then they made another one they all started watching movies together and started a group sign up to Netflix or go in a VHS tape at the same time and then have a twitter hashtag Oh they've i'll be tweeting it yeah like beating the movie magic and now it used to be like 10 people and now

they're on the road they played the Metro in my soul to tell this is a three year yeah and and they still do this stuff with hundreds of people so it's about having fun and it kind of know what you said about the blueberry jam makes me think is do something awesome then go the other way I mean because you've got trust and people like you and I know you and they think oh this is

good stuff and then you go the other way and they're more likely to follow you abrahan could be you a shot right and and i love that Dale Carnegie quote you make more friends in two months being interested in other people then you are making two years trying to get other people interested in you and so you have a song cult who is an amazing guy should follow him on Twitter he did the

promotions for freshbooks okay they went to South by Southwest and instead of saying great great people you should use this really you should use it sit down and we'll let me type you through the screens they just made pancakes for people that it's like people like pancakes we've a case like okay once you eat won't somebody eat your pancakes it's like then they owe you a couple of

minutes yeah hey you know could see your first books it's really great and you back off on your pitch yeah and and i said like i said in that it's not a gift if what you have is good and useful it's a time-released exploding guilt bomb you know give people something you give them a reason i tell bands if you want to get people to listen to your music you're asking for like half an hour of their

time do their laundry yeah and try to music while you're doing the laundry in the laundromat in time the next thing you know you'll have somebody like well I've got a mobile pancake food truck yeah so now it's a fitness anybody you know you turn something horrible into something really great cuz tell people what I don't particularly like this band but I like this bad more than I hate

won't they have you've got to think but most bounce my ball now our music is so important if your music is so important that do somebody's laundry to get their attention and build and or whatever combination do somebody's lawn do you know babysit what fishy sit cats it do whatever it is you find that way in the way in isn't my stuff is really good yeah you know my stuff is i'm going to

give you something okay well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with plants nice to talk to you

I hi it's mike with you task i'm here at go to calve 2014 i'm sitting here with russell wilson is the author of eloquent ruby and he's also presenting and on programming in interesting times here go to con 2014 thank you very much for taking the shower to speak so programming in interesting times what's so interesting about our times so i

think that that the times are interesting because i think we go through these periods where programming languages are very stable you know ten years ago there was java and maybe c sharp and most people were picking one of those are one of a very small menu of programming languages and i think that every now and then there's you know the major programming languages start the

decline they get towards the end of their life cycle and what happens is that you get this period of kind of flux rare it's not clear which programming language you should you should use or which programming language you should you know be keeping an eye on there's not an obvious default and i think we are definitely in one of those periods of interesting times where there's

there's a lots of programs you aren't you just do our yeah exactly yeah stairs right there's a enter trying to satisfy a similar niche right and so how do you decide and you know it's critically important for programmers because programming language those are of course are our key tool and they're also incredibly expensive tools it takes six months a year to become really

proficient and even like a straightforward programming language like Ruby let alone something maybe more complicated like C++ right you know back in the day or maybe Scala people say is fairly complicated so if you think of you know six months worth of work is maybe a thousand hours writing that is an unbelievably high call and that's just to become proficient yeah yeah much

less mastering right and so the talk is all about you know which programming languages should you keep an eye on and not which in terms of like specific languages but it's kind of a meta talk about you know what how can you select a new programming language and say that is what I'm going to keep my eye on you know that kind of thing well it's a very entry because i

also want through that myself when i went from c sharp I you know what I went from visual basic she was she shot it was a no-brainer yep it was I'm getting off of this hey you know choices were vb.net or C sharp and C sharp but then after a few years I went through that period where okay I'm ready to move on to do something else it was getting a little yep but it mean it's it that the

reason i call it interesting times is it's it's one of those best of times worst of times things you you get to the point where you're like okay well there's other options and i need to stop doing what I'm doing and that's great like you're ready to move on but then there's the frightening thing of yeah I need to move on and they need to get this right you know comedy and with

fortunately Ruby it already have ruby on rails and I was pretty established it was a seifish jump well it was if you were talking about 2004 I sort of got Ruby years before that I was a few years African yes there we go yeah so yeah it was pretty safe but you know now it's not so safe he's probably more like when you were pre 2004 right right um so yeah so I think I think as I say the the

really major programming languages are going through some kind of flux and we're seeing all these new ones I mean closure is the one that I've picked up most recently in the one you know kind of my new programming language but you know for different people in different circumstances it could be different and the other thing that's happening is we I think are going through the same kind of

thing that people went through in the 1980s when object-oriented programming came along well now it's functional programming seems to be the new if you ask me is the news new way of looking at the world and that's been impossible out more than just learning a new programming languages retooling the way you think about the whole paradigm is if ya this isn't

simply well how do you do an object in this language how do you get us and sutter ring create instance methods and no it's like no forget all of that right yes how do you handle Steve what yeah yeah or you know you know just a few years ago sort of multi-threaded programming with something exotic but not so many people did and now making concurrency work which is not quite the

same thing but making a concurrency work seems to be the thing that we need to master in the road really short term to get you know the modern world back working again you know when the light bulbs have an IP address that concurrent programming is really important and it would just one more variable into that decision is again when I was going from C sharp to ruby was also because of some

dissatisfaction with a corporately owned driven language and platform person open source and I looked at open source is being okay that's not necessarily tied to a marketing cycle yeah so when you're when you're looking these languages are you factoring those kinds of decisions in so what I think is what I say in the talk is basically this that I can't tell you what your next programming language

can be but i can tell you and and i think that what people tend to do is they tend the fasten on cool language they hear a talked about scala or licks earn in a name of the programming language closure and they fastenal onto that language and what you should really be doing is backing up and saying well you know open source vs. closed sourced is important to me functional it's

important to me how will you know I want to I want a programming language that those concurrency with communicating sequential processes I don't know and then go find a program which does that I think you men doing that that's how I found Ruby I one of the simple dynamically typed object-oriented programming language okay I say that and you just today you

know in this year you think okay well that would be Ruby you know one of a small number but I found Ruby by saying what did I want in a programming language and working from there instead of like looking at the menu of programming languages and saying oh that's a cool one great you know in extra says she has suffered them from so are you return are worthy and and

obviously with Ruby if you approach a level master you put a lot of effort into it a lot more than six months ah looking at these languages if have you been able to develop a strategy when you start to look at these languages or pick a language to maybe expedite that that effort to get to you as a sufficient but so the way the way elephant Ruby came available as I was teaching lot so

mostly java program the program in Ruby and they were all making exactly the same mistake server ever it's sort of the you know the obvious things that you might do if you came from some particular programming language to a different programming language and I started making a running list of you know what don't do this you're going to you're going to want to do this but do

this instead and I realize no one else was raining that stuff down there was no one place you could go to and say oh this is how the natives really do it right so let's let's just kind of accelerate that process along and get you up that point so I think for any programming language there is the sort of just basic proficiency level of you know I can I know how to do decisions

and in iteration sort of whatever in the further if you get the bad point and then you're a very like step before you really write anything significant is go start looking at how the natives or speaking this language go look if you want to remain I don't know some simple application out of them you know it's a classic clock round where that don't just sort of sit down and write your

version of it because you're honest certainly go off in the wrong direction we should do is you should peak at someone else's version and say okay that's the demo outline go back and then try it and then when you have something go back and peak again so then you're you know you're playing off of how do the natives speak it with practicing yourself and actually

that is I mean kind of in line with what dth was talking about with reading reading and writing code so that we can wear the right and reading yeah and then you read these these these works and then your build a better vocabulary by our understanding of sentence structure hey I mean if you learn French you do not learn French be wearing French grammar and then start making sense if

you learn French partially by that but also partially by reading either simple or more complicated bits of French literature and talking to actual French people right that's how you learn french and i think that the analogy is really pretty strong because you can actually i think learn to program them again a new programming language and actually be quite capable of it and be speaking a

dialect that no one else knows which is almost as bad because thinner or you know you kind of fort the community at that point but when you're first start though i had two people have that exact question that is coming from one platform and one you know I use camel cane so i use yes ask al case does any comment not the under the state cases weird so they they write what to me now

after several years of grey movie is kind of ugly but it's part of the learning process it really you know it's funny but for exactly that reason i recently came across one of the very first programs i've written in Ruby very like it was very even a you know the C Drive directory that have been given a larger you know the deed I've yeah directory you know kind of the archetype

okay I'll still it was Barry and I found it I actually put it on github but it's actually github project of it's not really my first ruby program but it's pretty close and it has all of that stuff amicus I have been in Java program or so looks like John baby and i think it's i would encourage everyone so you can find your yeah Ruby to put it out there to say to

show people mostly you know this is how I did it to everyone goes through that process but I think so one of the things I talk about in the top today is how if you're learning a new programming language like you start out you're all excited I'm gonna learn this new programming language the iceberg in your wedding is the syntax of that new programming language because we once

you're a programmer I think it's absolutely unavoidable you look at the syntax of a new programming language and it's like a punch in the stomach right right there is this emotional visceral reaction that sort of like a bag is evil right intellectual you know it doesn't matter it's just a different notation but but in your gut no it's bad every time I try to look at closure yes yoshi

why somebody who is very good at writing culture getting rehearse type functional code it uses all the constructs that are you know that you have to have a deep mastery of it and that is so one thing that looking at these functional languages if you come from a very house think of like C sharp and vb and Ruby and Java is being cut plain spoken languages there they're a working a

dialect a word you come into so you go from a very simple dialect that's very very obvious to some did it as a lot of nuance and shortcuts and lit but Ruthie has all kinds of nuances I mean I think all of the programming languages have all kinds of nuances and I think it's the kind of thing you know people who learn like new human you know French or whatever programming languages they talk

about the moment where they start dreaming in that mad language and that's the moment and so I thought it was seated yeah and I know what you're talking about with closure because I went through that I picked up closure and put it down like three times so I servant went through what you're talking about approximately three times but around the fourth time and it was me

like running out of time not being able to devote the time to it around you know around the fourth fine then again it's just me you know putting on some time and actually getting to that point all of that stuff made sense and so what I want when you say that it it's not really plain-spoken I can feel what you're saying but I don't feel that way anymore yeah it's

okay I'm reflecting in earlier moment for you we're just that's yeah any rate it gives us a process it's a real process of going to be initially you have to go through the sort of nausea over the syntax for any programming language right but Goodson X just makes you a little crazy and then you have to go through the you know maybe the conventions and things like that that

makes you a different kind of crazy and then finally you really get with these people are talking about you know they're there are restricted people program yeah so every setting identify which has despite what we may be some yes we say that you know time to cheat but if you think about you know all the thought that goes into even not very well known programming language those

are really towering intellectual achievements there are no stupid blowing there are stupid programming languages that you've heard that one yeah right you really have to respect them head you know what the program away they're mentally program get from the elephant face right and the interesting to pivot and look you know you you haven't bring the book art are you still actively in

the authoring world I so I've actually written two books alright because I love the constant repeat before okay with my roomie I am always writing I you know for me writing the books was like somebody coming along and saying hey we'll pay you for this thing it's wonderful anything and I'd be able to do that yes by the way thank you for this um and so yes I'm always I've had this

sort of book project simmering in the back of my mind that I work on and then I leave when I come back to and it's been a matter of how many hours are in the day but it's all about explaining technical things I think it I think uh we as programmers as technical people we have so much to explain to each other right are the things we work with really complicated with all these programming

languages and all that other stuff that we're dealing with and we really need to be like expert explainers right and by and large we or not we ready help yes we're learning how to explain room well me and I'll explain so so I have this book project which is about how to explain things okay okay because I think I think we may I again it's like the program or into a different language

there's a series of mistakes that people make when they try and explain things and you know take a soy example people can be doin complicated examples when they try and explain things and the example contents that overwhelmed the thing that they're trying to explain so I really believe if you look at my books the examples can be painfully simple because I don't want the example you

know the subject matter of the example to detract from one turn this side I just wanted them it's just enough of an example to motivate and yeah I've experienced exactly what you're describing ternity or something that might be simple to somebody and girls wanted to do this kind of a obscure descending out of parameters there has been a relationship did using the new

syntax and reels for which q changes how things work a little bit and I'd find lots of people had written about how they basically approach the problem but they had their own kind of domain this is mixed in there and edited you're trying to understand like okay get these four objects and not going to know how okay that the user was okay and then the user went into operation in the knockers

man you know inventory of inventory headman here it's like book okay like so like even the cognitive overhead from just the domain that they chose to describe the problem is already complex enough much less does the thing that they were trying to describe so for example in design patterns Ruby I think I don't know there's 18 chapters on that book or something and

there's 18 different examples and it's when I went to Ray elegant groupie I thought that you know I tried to make those 18 examples as simple as I possibly could and when he went to raynella contributed came to me and it's one long example there is basically one class in that book in variation for that class all the way through from beginning to end and yes you're sick of those

documents at the end the vinegar Ruby but at least you didn't have to reload you know the example and then if you are try to refer back to understand okay they change something in this second chapter well it's now a totally different theme and how does it relate yeah yeah you can wait i'ma catch the children to it oh okay the obvious difference is Shire because there is a

nice beige background yes allow the important things too so that's a good example of how you know you could either stay on the track so if you're willing if they're real trying to explain things and I think there's a lot of things like that i think it's it would be worth writing a book but to service it and you're a technical person is not you know the world of accounting or the

whole world or anything something for us here's how you explain or here's some you know not really tricks but techniques for displaying technical things that are kind of knowing the work because i spent 700 pages explaining technical things now are you publishing this through a publishing house where are you I has a religion I hadn't really decided I historically got the two

earlier books were you know sort of standard publishing and I haven't really decided which way I can get a little you know sort of old-school publishing maybe that's the word has its advantages they sort of take over everything and you don't have to worry about it that's the advantage that's also put this advantage they take everything everything and you kind of don't have any any control

unless you're you do a lot of negotiations and things like that um I haven't decided totally moment but I everybody seen a change in the relationship that publishing houses because of e-books and things install publishing it would be I think they're still catching up really think I'm still catching up i think they are kind of old school businesses and they're still

trying to catch on okay so it like all of us trying to figure out right wait how do I make this work I there are an interesting times yes yes there and I think there are more interesting times when we are you thank you thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for

spiked with you tastic i'm here at railsconf 2014 and i'm setting here with Richardson and Vav talk earlier today I called marabou 2014 a year in review there's also a real score contributor and he's creating a few libraries over the years one popular one was Sexton for helping rails developers see their routes without having to run rate routes and another was wicked witch would say

multi-stop form lizard basically um thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me yeah thnkx ravishing oh so I want you 24 hour open 2014 yung review we're only if he wants into 2014 how do you how do you do that that's that's pretty so so rails is really important to us so I measured my personal years from railsconf to railsconf fall ok so it's it's a

railsconf standard year it's all yeah ok so it's like the rails com calendar yeah there's like the gregorian exactly so you have a lot of really interesting things have happened this past year we've been majorly focused on performance and a lot of a lot of things in that thing or something ya know I had that recently about your talk yeah okay great uh what so one of one of the

biggest things that we released is is px dinos okay in the past Dino represents 512 megabytes of RAM and without with a px Dino instead you get I want to say it's mites ram and said six physical cores behind on six physical TV is yes for Dino so that in the past you've always been able to scale up very horizontally very easily but if you're using an application that has a lot of

member use or if you want a lot of concurrency per application let's say you want to run a bunch of unicorn workers or promote workers / actual physical Dino then you weren't able to in the past but now we're if it was a lot more on not just fast but consistently fast is kind of the the key with that so do you work with the the Dino team or how what is your role and

I'm okay okay so I work with I work at the Ruby task so Terrence Lee and I can on the languages team that we are in charge of the Ruby experience that means we maintain the don't pack whatever you do push heroku master and like all bundle install everything flies by your screen that's that's us ok so if like deploying is slow and I use your work ok great

granny times many many times we also luckily the company thinks it's a big part of that product is actually coming out and interfacing with the community and like finding real world people you know experiencing their pains or experiencing like yo I love you know I love your work and just figuring out what people like what people don't like how they're working and where we need to

go to the future there so a lot of that as well ok so I yeah we haven't mine my team hasn't directly implemented the PX Niners product but what's what's was interesting to us is that once they came out with this this product and they said ok we think this is important we think this is valuable they they kind of came to each individual language team and will instead like all right well how you

know how should people on you know python optimized maximize this naked on something like all right now that we have this happy people on Ruby like really an advantage of exactly exactly and so working in like hand-in-hand with some customers and doing a lot of experiments had just one afternoon I was like oh you know I wonder how many rescue workers I could run I'm right on

a pigsty know and I was like I was like all just guests and start at two hundred oh ok I can run that many like yeah also see how much we can make it fall over yeah exactly just playing around and end up so I wrote some documentation for a rescue pool as a result of that and so it's really nice having access to you know customers who are kind of craving and demanding for these things and then

are interested in actually working hand in hand with you and act in in implementing them and your world feedback from them so it's not just it's it's also been able to take a lot of that and take it over to other open source frameworks like like rails right so gallons so its first via I'll make sure I have to talk to you after this interview about so i bought

the PX cheap if my client does Oh utilize that so that's uh that's very interesting that's not too much for the interview but as far as how did you come to be with her okay x I mean you know with rails core kind of you tell us a little bit watching Jimmy there did you free with rails called before her uncle or so I'm actually on the issues team currently and what so I started working

for Heroku about two years ago little over two years ago previous to that I was working for a company called gowalla okay they were competitors to foursquare got bought by got bought by Facebook Facebook doesn't employ a lot of Ruby a little different platform yeah and loved crew basically forever and they have to have have a have a job slot and for forgive me involved with rails that was

something that like it was my dream to like have a commit into rails I remember bumping in it Aaron at that conference at one point in time being like how do I do this like have you know Hans even work I was like I want to add this this it's like you stop getting patched and post in your log saying like saying this request is a gift for requesting for some reason that got like moms they're

like no longer in there or maybe it was an error message or something and I was like how do I do this and like he helped me out and I was like this is great and so I kept trying to do that just whenever whenever whenever I ran it was like stub my toe on something I people how it like actually like dig in and fix that and just after time yeah it like actually with Sexton the routes in the

browser right I released that and then some of the some people on rails core actually independently approached me in there were like we love this can we have can you like please work with us to like get into rails you know rails proper and like that that was a pretty good experience and just hung out in the in campfire and just did about to work and one day I got an email saying hey like

we've given you like collaborator access like you know feel free to like close out close out issues and like you know do do all of this side right now that's just show you hearing that down the path that it's it's a common path that's get in there do something be helpful reach out to communicate and if you're doing good stuff eventually you're probably going

to become a trusted member of the team and you just keep going at the Charles not our head it kind of the same fence story you just saw some issues and just one hop on eventually you know he's running JRuby next thing you know yeah i mean like very like the famous quote like writers right it's like open source contributors contribute yeah like just you know start off the documentation and

like it's a it's not magic it's a lot of work yeah and office I'm just curious working with with the Ruby team you probably have to do a lot of interaction with people outside the community you know how's that how do you balance that with viewer you're actually going to conferences and talking how do you balance that with with working inside of your home organization it's really tough

any kind of balance is really tough i I tend to be the kind of person that like I get a problem and I like it's like that's all I can think about that one problem right so a lot of forced context switching a lot of I mean even given at even at conferences just like having to having to partition time and saying like okay you know what even like I'm here I'm still meeting people one trip well

maybe it's not a trick but at conferences i think i think it's actually mistaken to try to go to every single session right and you know even if it's it's specially if it's a multitrack session or you know conference you just can so i try to reserve about fifty percent of my time for just hallway interactions bumping into people like having some great

conversations find out what other people are working on and is still love going to go to the toxin then hearing everything there but you Nepal so instead of working in my room like all the work outside and there somebody bumps into me and asking a question about something I've been working on or they wanted like you know typically the best feedback is

like unsolicited feedback like somebody's like hey you know I didn't like this one thing that happened when I was pushing the Roku then I'm like oh you know I can actually do something about that Frank like just you know recently we've had so it's like people are like oh I'm getting bad performance and it's like oh well like let me take a look and said okay oh I see you're using

web brick and in production and it's uh yeah it's like oh I didn't know that it's like it just says rails like it says rails server and then you know it's just real server it's like yeah but so the more complicated yeah it's like we well we've you know and so I've added some some warnings and some things that just this kind of like gradual trying to gently lead you to the path of happiness

and then you know and this is a probably question a left field but I'm is so much in Charles Nutter earlier pedius is a dream would be maintainer the there's there's a trend towards moving towards using JRuby encouraging people to use jruby because of proper flooding and you know some that support when you're wrong long running processes is that something that like you are you using see Ruby or

are you starting to encourage people to look at JRuby with the Roku or sun so so we support a JRuby for a while actually and we work with Charles quite a bit we also we have we have Rubinius it's it's actually technically not supported but but it's also runs and it worked on our support is actually provided through the Rubinius team um yeah and so I just generally reckon courage people to like

play and have fun when like please like if you're on MRI now try mr try jruby right and like I when we first went for launch JRuby like I wrote docs on mud migrating a rails app and you know just some things like even being a week trying that as a gem off there I was like oh wow there's all of these gems that like just don't work in on JRuby because of like super easy

extensions and and so like in the future now that i'm working on gems I'm very conscious of like how like on Travis I always test on JRuby and always test on ravinia say like with Travis you can have multiple targets exactly you can you can just say test this on JRuby or MRI 1982 things like that so you can get some that flexibility yeah and it's also the more people who try and the more

people would demand these things and are looking for them the more knowledge there is out there it's a lot easier today to switch over your app to use JRuby the community portion of it typically my code has been relatively trivial most of my coat just works and it's and like over time like it gets faster and so like I think every app is slightly different so some people just

want like running you know fast strips and like that's it exactly like you cannot beat the MRI like boot up time it is great amazing like if you wanted if you can paralyze and you're actually doing real Ruby like number crunching like JRuby and thread it sound like i stoop but i still actually recommend MRI even though we have a global interpreter lock it's still not it's not like it you

can still write threaded code especially if you're using like web server you're on the web like you're using database calls you're kidding api's all these other things didn't you create a background worker Jeong confronted or something like that yeah yeah yeah yeah I cuz actually i spiked on that myself between sucker punch and and i threaded so yeah and being able to use that for

background and I'm JRuby and save a few bucks on dinos was yeah yeah so i forgot about that so even even in other smaller ass right now he is as popular you've done a bunch of op open source sorry that was though you're talking about threads and I was in there oh yeah that's that that's something that's you can do that you don't necessarily always have to

spend a rescue worker baby in a separate Dino or mean Heroku and and that's the reason I was asked about moving to jail Ruby is being about do those things where I can consolidate and have one my phone I the long-running process it's going to be kind of quick that I want to be able to just please return my response back to the clients I can run this thing in a separate das one in a

earlier today you had a book signing so you're moving into the world of being an author your code writer and now your book author yeah I do a writer of many things so the name of the book is Roku up and running it's a publish on o'reilly also co-author Neil Middleton he like it was he actually started the book and then then brought me in so a lot of there there's some other Heroku

books out there and most of them just end up being do this then do this and do this and it's just number one all but the majority of it it's very technical very Road it's all online already and there's no explanation as to why and we wanted something that's a little bit more timeless it's really got into the philosophy and published a couple couple months ago and it's it's not outdated

yet oh yes yes that's rare it's like and that it's like that's the that's like the golden standard of what we were going it didn't make it past the three-month mark yeah I think like just yeah we're right there so well known in a few days whether or not he really liked revamping our r.v if the book collapses but and I've had skype at some people tell me that like they played

around a little bit with Roku and there's there's a large number of things that like they didn't realize or they knew that that was what happened but not necessarily why it did happen that way yeah and even today at lunch I was hearing one of the other employees from heroic with its here the sitting at a pond people were just picking his brain trying to understand and it sounds like

who's done a great job of black boxing a lot and making a very low barrier to entry being able to go beyond that and say okay what kind of you with this this thing that I have this dino what is what is that you know in it and these obstructions sometimes yeah they look good for marketing and being able to just have a common language but one sometimes for the how do I get in there

and do something you know for and things I do every day there's a you can run Heroku run Nash and I can actually get a bash shell into I can LS society and you know I know that exactly yeah and it's like I literally use this every single day and so there's there's some stuff in there like that that like tech it's like there's a whole section on debugging and troubleshooting and like you know things

that you might not have known before right but I mean like we do love the we aim to be as easy to use as possible and kind of my goal in life is to make that a little less magicky and a little less black boxy and then just make it a little bit more user friendly yeah so like for the ninety percent use cases it's a nice even path and it's nice and well trodden but when you need to go off

and just a lesson to your bin directory and see what permissions are on some fin ya in which you know which bundle and yeah all of these other like so there's a lot of that stuff it's being exposed in the book and how to do that yeah because to be frank people when I said aha Roku Dino is a linux n since they're gonna bunch of 10 i feels wordsworth where it's at right now or something

they were like i did not get wait runs on a computer i thought i was literally magic I mean it's almost like is it is it some kind of custom peaceful you know image it's that's own kernel or some of that yeah you don't know you know it's hard to tell those kinds of things unless you go in there and dig around somebody come up to 800 you you inject a custom version of rails right and no

yeah it's the version of rails you specified I think someone that comes from one of rewrite sugar here enemy she ammo you're like what really happened there not just for a file yeah anyone also mounting some gems that used to do yeah yeah that's that's changed but why me again thank you very much for taking the time like you hope you up and running for you up running great and

that's some shots on amazon in all those places wherever you find books thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm

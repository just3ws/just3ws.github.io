hi i'm mike with you tastic I'm sitting here we're just outside of software craftsmanship McHenry County I interrupt at imager to come out and do a quick interview tim has written the agile and a flash card so he co-authored the agile and a flash flash cards that agile teams can use to make sure that they're there i'm pat on the path of agile enlightenment also you contributed to

the clean coder a book which all of us are familiar with and but thank you very much for sitting down with me the first question i kinda want to lead off with this you wrote these this list of all these core concepts to agile and it's a pretty thick stack was there anything that when you started off with kind of maybe changed as you were maybe something in time realized wasn't quite

the way it was when you because it's the thing with a geology you learn um not so much actually we actually had a we incubated for about a year and a half Jeff langer and I did on the website and then when we actually came time to build a book we really just thought we were going to take articles off of the website and turn them into cards but we really couldn't do that because we

realized that we were addressing too techy of an audience so we did it breaking it down to you know four sections and talked about you know the project leaders and the managers and the planner and everybody in there I think the cards have actually stood up pretty well our problem was that we limited it to 52 okay Jane you have to do it a few times

in a year if you're going to go through it yeah that's right you can do one a week and some teams have but now there's just so much more that I wish I could put in there there's so much that's behind those you know it's a very lossy compression right will you take you know whatever's in your life hey Megan diesel accion enough now it's a four by six card so the chapter 2 from clean code

actually is condensed to I think like a four or five point card somewhere in the back of the deck now yeah so you could have said a lot of money on the book it made it a pamphlet but so it sounded like it wasn't originally gonna be flash cards it sound like he was going to be a book originally well it's kind of kind of a weird origin so I'm i was working for object mentor this is several years

ago in des moines at geo learning and one of the gentlemen there I know he's a good programmer his name is George hi George he was uh he asked me he had missed the morning session and he asked me if I could catch him up right and so as an act of complete hood spa I said meet me in the training room with three index cards in a sharpie and we'll catch you up okay I had no idea I was going to

do it haha but we wandered in and I know George is smart I know he knows what he's doing he just hadn't done TDD so I wrote down Bob marcus three rules and I did the red green refactor and I did the first properties and he understood well enough that in the next session he could join with the group and contribute equally yeah and I realized people are way smarter than we think and we teach

things over four hours it could have been 15 minutes right they could end in practice and especially with experienced people they might not have may be followed specific rules but so much of this is a distillation of practices that are already out there and when you kind of people and you can point to say oh it's this thing might be like oh okay i can relate that

to x y&z that i did over the last five years just give me the cheat sheet yeah so then jeff and i thought we would write a book and it would be a companion deck to the book okay but nobody understood that until we got to pragmatic programmers and they said yeah oh yeah that's a good idea you know we don't think we're interested in the book oh we just want the car he just let the

deck yeah so we spent a chunk of a year working on the deck so there isn't anything that's that's really wrong in there but I think nothing could go far enough and nothing could go deep enough to really get to the important stuff so since then I've been building up more like on brain science David rock and and Carol Dweck and Csikszentmihalyi and and height and all these different guys I

really kind of wish that could have earlier gone through and then all of this about how to coach and how to learn and that could have been like a whole section or so not even just how to be an agile t but how to lead an agile team yeah and how to think about waiting okay yeah that's don't to think about thinking think about leaving too much I mean a lot of us are developers who are

kind of like focus on just how I can contribute but taking that step back and I mean is it is that even like going to the next level of your career or is that something even applies to people who are working on a team and art in a leadership position I think that I think it applies the individuals I think it was was it maybe Keith ray or maybe Jeffrey's or maybe Rainsford we're

talking about having an inner critic right that when they're practicing writing code half of their brain is split and it's critiquing and observing how they go about solving their code problems and how they're thinking through the problems so they're actually kind of like two people right which that's hard to do but by mindful II practicing your code art you can

suddenly realize you know better ways you can step things out and things you didn't realize you need to learn it's kind of like so ultimate small community up to pair programmers that one person while they're typing they're thinking very pragmatically and very detailed and right and very you know how do I solve this problem yeah we're just going to get that thing to happen yeah and then

the other person who's watching them yeah they're watching for syntax errors or whatever but they're also thinking is this the right direction is this a good answer are we going to make sense yeah we r we going to end up by going this way and I kind of want to be that inside my head but I'm planning that they're just too many cognitive biases you really are can't entirely do it but you

can develop a sense of watching yourself work which i think is important for everybody well that's kind of like with with Corrine skoda's and and even as I chose learn program the hard way it's you do these things by rote and you do wrote enough that you stop thinking about the problem and you sort of thinking about how you're approaching it on my fingers like doing guitar practice

can I get my fingers in that position you know it's not I could just do the same note a hundred times but I just want to get that position and it's the same thing with the code I don't want to solve this problem I just want to solve a problem Wow alright so the shoe Hari pattern we have a card for that oh yeah that's that's right yeah it's one of the cards one

thing though I just want to tie this into user communities though you kind of describe a pair as a the ultimate small community because it's two people that have to collaborate and agree on a direction and ensure knowledge of that code and the problem but in the more macro groups the user groups and that conferences you know you travel all over the world have you gotten a chance to go

and experience other groups or other conferences and see an all-conference in Australia's as a comparison to a conference in Copenhagen not quite so much as that now I did just get back from New Zealand and I attended the Canterbury software summit and you'll find it's a lot like our conferences here you know the scale is a little different the South Island there they're

really now starting to become agile and they're they're really using like distributed governance and all kinds of crazy you know we would consider far out right but but they're small and they are very tight into their community and they have their own consultancy so it's actually a very tight-knit group and people know each other and they're all in a similar experience of growing

toward agility and drop growing into new techno what is distributed governance that's a that's kind of an interesting question there's a nice talk by Scott from ad scale instead of having a hierarchy of bosses your company is formed into rings of influence so maybe you're a programmer but also you have a knack or an interest in the work of maybe writing

proposals and collecting new business so you may be sitting in both of those rings okay and so there's a ring that decides how to pay the bills and what the salaries are and then there's a ring that the sides are very suffering right those guys over there annal economy those guys over there handle HR paperwork so it's actually being managed ruled and run by little communities and

people are members of different communities and of course the task is the reason for the team so if you're into bill paying and money management you can be a part of that like little community within the company it's really amazing how well they're doing how open and transparent and how sharing their with everything it's really a great place yeah now I don't see that so much

here yeah yeah it's a little bit more hierarchical a little more rigid yeah well mi want to say thank you very much for taking the time to sit down thank you

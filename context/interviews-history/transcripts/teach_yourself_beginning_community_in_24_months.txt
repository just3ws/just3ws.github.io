hello I my call I do a site called you tastic where I go and I interviewed about a hundred people and when we get in you're going to see that it's really about amateur it's this is amateur hour this is we're going to get together and have some fun so I'm already going to assume that everybody's everybody's familiar with user groups right everybody's been to or raise your hand

if you've ever been to a user group alright great so everybody knows and I'm just going to kind of assume that we're talking about the standard format of a of a monthly meeting that goes on for one meeting a month so why does start a user group and I didn't say how to start a user group because that's that's going to be an easy question we're going to go over in about five minutes but the

reason you'd why you'd want to start a user group is shooting at the organizers perspective and one of the things until you've actually had to get up and run a user group you're not going to really understand what it's like and in what goes into running a conference and what you can learn and what what's really going on in in a session so so yeah so start a user group in five easy steps

the trick isn't the steps to themselves but that you're going to keep doing them the steps are very easy they just pick a topic whatever you're passionate about whatever you like if you're if you're want to learn closure start a closure group if you want to learn Ruby start a ruby group if you're in an area that doesn't have anything going on just whatever you'd like find a place it

doesn't have to be really fancy you don't have to have a table outside to sponsor you library I did my first user group meeting in a library and it didn't work because they won't let me use the projector because I would break it and so I went to panera panera had a projector but it just didn't work so but the point was is it it didn't matter where it just mattered that we met

someplace pick a schedule this one is the tricky one because we're talking about feedback later but you want to be able to do something that you can regularly do you want to pick a schedule that is going to be um something that that people can be aware of and plan for and then tell people do things like make stickers make websites make a twitter account make a

facebook page wear a t-shirt with your logo on it I make stickers to give people tell people until they're tired of hearing about it because eventually maybe they'll give up and they'll go ah so this is with the hard one this is the repeat 24 times to be sure like I said it's it's very easy to do those first four things when it gets hard is when you have to do a month after month or

you're sitting in a meeting because nobody showed up because you've scheduled it on the night game of thrones was was going to do murdering everybody ah it's okay to quit uh I said give 24 months you'll give it some time but if it doesn't work for you quit but because you've given a time you're going to you're going to make friends you're going to learn what what what is going

on in and and and who you can trust it so you can turn the group over to somebody meetup com I'm going to point this out because we're not here to show what great hackers we are by we're going to create the greatest blog that's going to show off all of our great events just just suck it up go to meetup com it's open the counts like 60 bucks a year people will be able to find you now

here's where you start to learn you're going to pay attention to your meetings and it doesn't just mean listen to the speaker talk it also means and I'm glad there's a slide here that can read that one uh it means that the MC is you that you are the person you're the master of ceremonies who's going to be getting up and making sure people are having a good time are learning that the speaker is

comfortable that they have all of their stuff set up and that's when people are sitting there awkwardly not asking questions you're going to be that the gesture that the speaker you're going to be flavor flav letting people have a good time so you want to look at your attendees and I didn't say look at the speaker first it's a look at your attendees look at how how they're

interacting how are they having fun are they talking to people are they are they talking to each other break up those conversations if people are isolated go and sit down and talk next to somebody and then look at your speakers see how they're doing are they uncomfortable are they trying to read slides and then totally getting lost because they flipped them the wrong way

that's a it's an opportunity to go in and say hey you know let's let's break up the ice take some of the pressure off of the speaker so that way they can be comfortable and teach so and then look at your attendees looking at your speakers now you've looked at it what how people are interacting and how speakers are able to do their thing make sure that there's communication going

between them that's if there's a lull or if there's it seems like the audience is disconnected hey bring up the naive question and then get feedback you want to be able in this kind of goes into what Mike bushes ask people what they didn't like about the conference did they like the pizza do they like the topic and also pay attention to the other more subtle feedback of did

everybody show up to a JavaScript meeting but they didn't show up to the closure meeting maybe do more JavaScript meetings so you testing is where I interview people like I said hundred people that are tech community leaders conference organizers user group Foss all that stuff please come to the site look at it tell me how the how bad I'm doing and then if you are somebody who

makes a Fuss project it runs a user group or something I love to interview you or if you have a just an interesting perspective on technical community hit me up at Mike you tastic calm and again just to remember it's amateur hour we're all having fun you don't have to be a super organizer to run a user group just give it time thanks

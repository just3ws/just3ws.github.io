hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here again at railsconf 2014 and I'm standing you're adjusting Collins justin is going to be a tough doing a talk tomorrow I'll Tales from the Crypt but he's also the creator of the break human gem ah well thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me first can't you stall her the breaking gym because i'm a fan but i'd like you to describe so the

brakemen gym is the sack analysis security tool for ruby on rails applications so it looks at your source code provides potential vulnerabilities and lets you know about weight it's a dynamic language how can we do any kind of static analysis oh boy so i talked about that quite a bit you know the important thing for security tool is just finding stuff and yes secure static

analysis security purists may be upset because you you can't prove certain things or you can analyze certain things but for a security tool it's really not that important that it be perfect but just that we're able to identify potential problems inside the source yeah it's kind of like if you just because you can't maybe identify everything doesn't mean you shouldn't

identify exactly exactly so so what kind of inspired you to create fabric it's kind of a long story but basically I got an internship on a security team ATT interactive and I had proposed during my interview something like this knowing nothing about security or rail sort of i knew i knew it was but no experience with rails i proposed hey what if you just had a tool that found the stuff for

you and they said hey why don't you work on tool that before us and they were nice enough to allow me to open source it into my interview good night and then i worked for them later as well Social Security is something that you're at a fashionable I mean I fell into it by accident you know I guess I just happened to get an internship on a security team no real like security

experience before that but I you know I've been able to create it all it's been really helpful for people and through that tool I've gotten into the security community and you know I think as a developer there's always an advantage to being a developer and having security knowledge because a lot of times the security community is not perceived as being very nice people or

very very smart people sometimes by developers who are like I'm just trying to get stuff done they're always blaming me for doing things wrong boy they know they don't even write code it's always good to be able to bridge that gap and approach people you know in a nice way be a nice person yeah and I've liked being able to run the Berkman analysis on my gem and and a few other on my

projects a few other options along those lines that are else practices and anything that can help give a little bit of insight into you what's going on in the code is always free it was curious you said you can't cover everything is there something maybe you would like to be able to cover but is a common problem it just kind of too hard to really pin down that the developers on browse

projects should be thinking about wow that's a really good question yes there are there are things that are difficult to determine statically there are some things that it would just take too much time to determine okay and I try to keep breaking them fast for most people I think one like one good example for example is that you know you don't always know what gems are doing it

frickin doesn't look at your dependencies okay her methods for example they tend to get use HTML safe a lot because maybe they're building out tags and you tend to trust those helper methods because somebody wrote it and they pray what they are doing and in your view it looks like it's escaped but actually the helper might be sending HTML safe and building out some tags but

they're also putting in user input now you have cross-site scripting okay and that's something that great and could possibly find it but right now I can't so something to look at is look at your jams if they're doing dynamic if your content yeah any kind of content generation any kind of oh I'm using this helper to generate some HTML you might want to look into that and see what

exactly are they doing are they properly escaping the values where they just clung HTML safe and and just camel them yeah exactly exactly firstly upper tier talk the it's a grip talk but it's Tales from the Crypt yes and I'd nom preserving that's encryption oh that would be a good assumption yeah well we're actually not going to talk about encryption oh okay yes well it's a very

side note okay to be honest I didn't notice the pun until after the taco is accepted hey oh we should have done something with this pun yeah because with with open us all hardware encryption is a hot topic it is a hot topic but I think everyone's kind of aware you know I have very non-technical people approach me and say hey what about part please yeah that affected

Twitter you know did what should i do something ran these are people who are noting not technical at all and yet they've heard about it so I don't think probably people at railsconf don't need to hear about it even more right right and that wasn't the the purpose of our talk to the purpose of our talk is just we really we're going to present sort of you're your worst nightmare one day in

the life of a couple developers at a company and it's just like one security problem after another okay and just kind of trying to demonstrate you know the end these things happen I mean people find these problems people sites get hacked into and so we're just it's kind of just the teaching and hopefully we can present some proactive steps to prevent these really a dancer well I'm

looking forward to your talk and I really appreciate you something that I'm stricken in no problem thank you thank you perfect thank you very much yeah man my legs call me yeah have some very static analysis uh or at least information no so the story I was not tell you ah alright so i worked with uh not directly work with Aaron but we asset and

proximity to each other haha I was a group on every thought the first time is the first time yes and all usergroups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations passera of information find out for yourself today yep you guessed it calm you

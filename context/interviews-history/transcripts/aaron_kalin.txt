hi I'm Mike and here with you tastic at Chicago up conf again I'm sitting with Aaron killin aaron has been heavily involved with the Ruby community doing a lot of speaking over the years but also he's your trainer at treehouse and today he just did a panel discussion in Chicago web country araki can you tell a little bit about how you have like what is how is it different doing a

presentation versus doing like a panel and how did you prepare for it did you prepare differently or what never had never done a panel style thing before I've been to conferences or those panels yes I kind of know what the format was but I got this sort of last minute from JC when the organizers I think just literally a couple days ago already been mentioning it to me but it wasn't really

official yet and then literally about two days ago I got an email saying hey I realize it's last minute but do you want to moderate the the panel on the future of web I said sure why not no idea what I was getting into yeah but yeah I'm sort of like a boy scout I want to be prepared so I started researching online just like trying to prepare for like any mindset so I mean how is that different

from like when you prepare to do a regular presentation is it is it vastly different or it's a very different mindsets it's one I think you would be more what am I going to talk about Marissa what are they going to talk about well like so i guess the the huge difference is that good and it's a presentation it's it's actually a bit more about you people especially if like

you're one of the scenic conferences where they announced the speaker's really early before they close call for proposals I've been one of those are they like directly invite you with the exception of I think when you see rails but it's not to wear like people are coming to see you directly so at that point a presentation is really all about the speaker right and you know of course

you want to include the audience and all that stuff in there but it's really more of like sent you your self focused but it's the exact opposite on a panel you want to moderate and be sort of the guy with the whip but you also don't want to be the center of attention because it's about the panelists and not the moderator specifically so there's this weird balancing act you have to

play least you know everything I was reading about it and it started to make sense about all the panels that I've seen that I thought we're good where the moderator doesn't become the center of attention and more or less you know that you try to ask some questions that aren't necessarily directly polarizing but enough to invoke some good conversation because you want to get you

know everyone's opinions and especially if you have a panel of very differing backgrounds and opinions you're going to get some sometimes very similar we're very different answers and just balancing that where it's not about you and that's the hard part yeah I am used to president presenting where it's like yeah these are my stories this is my subject I want to talk about all that

stuff but then switching that completely off and trying to keep that no curb and not try to start like stealing attention is it's difficult to know and when when you were doing this on the presentation we're all the panelists first type analyst or they had ever said on a panel before I didn't get enough time to really ask so I go check after yeah after this interview and insert

affiliates hey that was cool I think that I only got to see that to jen because Tim was already kind of walking away David was still there but talking to someone else in the same like being a great job you know yeah just did a good job and everything so I don't really have to go collect those thoughts afterwards to make sure you know when I did a good job and the other thing too

and your moderators you don't want to want to make the panelists look really smart and you don't want to belittle them at all and you don't want to know railroad them in any way but you also don't want them to become the center of attention so that's like the other part of it two of you know making sure that you keep control of anyone who starts to take the mic and I told them before we

started like this for me there's a heart like two minute limit there was something close to it if it's a good conversation let it go but if you start rambling and getting out of pulpit that I'm going to pull you down yeah you know get the audience to say something or so did now if somebody didn't go on I mean I'm gonna presume that nobody went off the rails here but did you learn many

techniques like well if somebody is starting to kind of ran two vids or hog the might was there any like kind of tips or tricks that you learned like go see this kind of thing or the side you can defuse it yeah so I read a couple different techniques one was to sort of you know find a spot when they're grabbing their breath so you have to start when start noticing your head that

they're going a little bit beyond like it was also you know looking at my iPad occasionally to see at the clock and all that stuff mr. noticing they're getting a little bit off on a tangent I think it only really happened like as we're of it once or twice yeah and that's when you're you know the trigger start to go my head of okay I need to start listening to what they're saying so at

some point if I can find a graceful pause alright then I'll interject a joke somewhere I want to try to do that so like all and it's it's sort of easy to do with the front end step so you can see like you know the throw in comic sans or just something to get the audience to just have to get the audience to break that pattern and then yeah I guess you know usually people

sort of get the message like I just stopped you gracefully so just let it go yeah and then the other technique to is also interjecting with like adding on to the conversation so you sort of step in and you grab the the mic for a minute and then you can disperse it back out okay so yeah so one is kind of up I want to say like the magician's look over here there's a word for that I'm just

drawing a blank on it but yeah just muscle direction mr. Rushton yeah in this direction and then the other one was helping them take that step and realizing oh okay I because one of the things i do with the interviews is if I feel like somebody's starting to repeat themselves and that's the usually the time or if we're starting to come back around on the topic we started it

talking on one subject one off and then all of a sudden now it feels like over back on the topic either it's either a graceful stopping point or try to push him back to the original topic um you've also taught classes and you know I'm sure you've had to deal with you know feel

hi it's mike with you task again I'm sitting down with Aaron Holbrook who has started up a user group in a wordpress user group in mchenry county illinois and he's also spoken at several of the word camps and he's actually getting ready to start up another wordpress oriented I conference so thanks Aaron for sitting down with me so what is the mchenry county linn Simic mchenry county

wordpress meetup that's right and thanks for having me Mike I really appreciate it um yeah so I started just recently in the last couple months McHenry County wordpress meetup so basically there was no user group there's no really community out where I live which is northwest suburb of Chicago McHenry County so I decided to put one together okay great and why wordpress though i'm

a big wordpress developer i've been i've been using wordpress since 2005 so i'm pretty pretty fanatical about it and it's about ninety-five percent of what I do so I'm really dedicated to WordPress and using it in my business and really giving back to the community and helping other people learn how to use it and answer their questions and you know I'm networking with with the community so

people that are also interested in WordPress but I think it's interesting because I I've mostly approached word process am just as a purely blogging platform but when I was reading up a little bit before we spoke is that it's a it's a lot more than just that yeah it really took a turn in about two thousand nine custom post types or content types were were rolled out and it turned

WordPress from a blogging platform really to a full-fledged CMS with a lot of really really good features especially the client the client ease of use and that the ability for end users to be able to use it to maintain their site is really really good so that that's a really nice feature of WordPress so what kind of what do you guys talk what's your format for your

meetup oh well like I said we just we just started a couple months ago so we've only had a couple but it's been and we've had you know like open forum with Q&A questions you know sessions where people just bring the list of questions and we just kind of have some drinks and some pizza and dinner and and we just kind of talk about you know what can you do on WordPress we know what

should hey I'm a beginner what should i do or like what plugins are good we just our most recent we actually had Heather actin who leads the lake county wordpress meetup and she's really really smart and she's got she gave a whole lecture on like the best best you know tips and practices for for beginners and you know like what you should do when you first like it get involved with your

your WordPress site so so that was pretty good um yeah so how's that no that's perfect I what yes the sometimes this happens I get tongue-tied but what I was going to say is uh as far as like how many have you been able to reach many people how do you I mean is her pretty vibrant WordPress online community that you were able to reach out to or yeah there's there's actually

in around Chicago there is a really tight-knit group of WordPress contributors and in community members and I since going to work camp chicago in two thousand 2010 i think it was was my first time and not actually I take that back it was last year yeah last year was the first time I had gone 2011 and I got to talking with the organizer who I like I mentioned before her name

is Heather actin she was she was the organizer last year and I i was wondering cuz like i had applied to speak and I didn't get accepted so I went up to her and I asked why and you know I was like what can I do better to you know get an opportunity to speak at one of these and so so we got to talking and it turned out I had get in the title of my presentation and that was they

were they weren't sure if they should use that because of you know it wouldn't necessarily be neutral so um but I got to talking with her and I'm not a great bunch of people and yeah it was I'm sorry going back to the question I I i got i get lost oh I I'm lost you now that's okay that happens sometimes uh no I was most I was asking about um how did you reach the people

that that work oh that where did you go online or um actually meetup com did a spectacular job of just letting people know like if they were looking for something like that so I didn't do a heck of a lot of I didn't do any marketing I just kind of told people and then when I went to the word camps I love people know but yet me know comment did a great job of people just started

showing up you know I put it out there and then people just started showing up to it I think you asked also sorry about the intention you asked about how I think big my group is right right or like how active is um I think we have about 50 people signed up in the group but really it varies between like 10 and 15 people show up in person oh that's pretty good so I meneses especially it's

far out I'm also for Allah the same neck of the woods as you so I know how hard it is to get people out to meeting sirs I used to run a group called a software craftsmanship McHenry County which is kind of just open up the road from where you're at um it's a it's a but so it's very much a software or any group but some that's another thing it's like it's a focus of your groupon on how to use an

administer wordpress or is that how to develop plugins you know Stevie in all this what I found like I am more of a higher level developer so I'm talking about version control and you know things that are way past beginners and I would love to do more talks like that but unfortunately well I mean it is what it is like a lot of people are just learning about WordPress so we have a

lot of beginners which is fine like that's that's totally fine we just have to gear the content and the topics more towards that so yeah that there's the is more I would love to get more of the developers like you and me you know people out to some of these because I think not only could they help contribute but I would love to meet you know more developers all right I can

personally say that the scmc group is looking to move their blog and they could they could certainly use some help with getting off of posterous well you're hurt y'all alright great well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me really appreciate it no problem thanks family Mike

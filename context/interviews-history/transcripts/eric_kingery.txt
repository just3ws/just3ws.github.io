user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with you tastic I'm sitting down with Erica Nuri who runs the refactor Chicago group formerly the PHP Chicago was in Chicago PHP Chavez PHP

you should have a PHP community thank you for taking the time to sit down with me we're here at the SCA conference in Chicago 2013 SEMA 2013 should have said that in the beginning but that's okay we'll keep going anyways so the refactor group what is there were Franco Rubin and how'd you get involved and think you get started sure so as I mentioned we started at Chicago's PHP community

meetup that was started about four years ago and we had success yeah but it was just hard to retain people throughout the group's because we had a disparate range of fairly in-depth topics yeah and we found a lot of beginners I think we're a lien ated by some of the more advanced topics we were if I am into yeah and so we also realized when we were looking for speakers that a lot of

the problems in the peach p community deals with and the challenges are not PHP specifics or a lot of languages have web frameworks but more importantly a lot of technologies are outside of the language specific details so we were interested in MongoDB as well and how to design for mobile in how to use JavaScript effectively but with a PHP flavor exactly but those are problems

that people from all communities all language specific tech communities deal with so we wanted to broaden the scope and bring in people from all different communities right and then refocus on not just how to be a better PHP developer but how to think in a way that allows you to be a more effective software professional right so were you able to but how did that change that

dichotomy between advanced topics that go they had beginners to being too low level and also alienating people who are more experienced sure so it's just easier to have a wide range of topics on both of those fronts so in PHP you can only cover the beginnings of PHP so many times without being repetitive and you can cover the beginnings of a wide array

of technologies javascript HTML CSS design but then also we're expanding it to include just refactoring ideas so very recruiting and the importance of diversity and technology we want to go beyond the scope of just one specific language to cater to more people you know both on the beginner level in the more advanced level there will still be some meetups that more advanced people

will want to attend some of the architecture focused ones and you know we wanted there will still be a split I think but there's just a much broader range of topics we can cover right for both both sides and in as far as like but in keeping with your core membership are you still do you find yourself still doing more stuff with PHP or are you bringing in a different crowd that maybe

it's totally than something else we just rebranded so we only have one meet up on Oh came back through chicago name and we've got the second one coming up november 16th i believe don't quote me on that um but Jenna I this will be after that cool okay great so the agenda Myers has come and talk about okay and what we found with that challenge of retaining people is that a lot of them

well I talked to a lot of the people who had been coming for years not a lot of the core members and they were all open to broadening the scope because oftentimes they had moved on from PHP in their career as well and so it really just made sense for the core people who were showing up repeatedly and since retain retaining people for me it for me up was a

challenge it made sense to just branch on from there right we may still be PHP Cindric just based on my network that you know in people right networks who they know but the point is now we can more easily engage someone from the Python community or the rails community come and talk about things that you know might not have been is relevant in the past yeah because it's interesting it

makes me think about there was a debate I'd heard about what language should we be using to do presentations that if you go and see a JavaScript presentation or a general topic and you might not be a JavaScript developer but it's about solid principles for say for example in and it's it's presented to you in Java but you're a JavaScript developer and you don't know Java so you know how how

what should the expectation be of the people in the audience in some of the arguments were that if you're a decent developer you should be able to discrete code and understand the shape and the pattern but sometimes I found that having something that reduced that that impedance mismatch and saying okay you know the fundamental concept is is ax but if I least present it in something

that's a common idiomatic language is it is that something that you're looking at you know you're if you do presentations probably at me with PHP in sure sure so the way I would look at that is kind of against splitting it into the audience that you want to speak to so if you're talking about the solid principles and you're introducing them you should be able to do that in a way that's language

agnostic right and a language that you put up there should be readable things should be need properly if you can do that in a straightforward way even if someone doesn't know for example they should be able to pick up on the concepts if it's an introductory talk if you're doing an advanced talk then you know you could cater to JavaScript of Java developers

or people who are doing C++ that would be fine and then more advanced people who would be drawn to that talk probably have either been exposed to those languages or would be able to pick up the context from the presentation and still get value out of something that's not in their primary language I just wanting to take a step back and just go back to how you got involved in the PHP

community here in Chicago what what uh how did you get involved with the user group you know way back a few years ago sure so i co-founded it with a recruiter actually and we've kind of moved away from that focus and that was another one of the reasons for rebranding we want it to be more about the community and what I was at sittercity hey I and I was said receiving a company or yeah so their

startup in Chicago they've got a couple of rounds they were one of the bigger ones along with threadless was that like a baby sitter service exactly they got my parents and babysitters online so I was working with a recruiter to staff up our team there after one of the funding rounds and the best move that we made was hiring one of the core Kohana developers which is a PHP of web

framework that we used to build out a new version of our product and so we started getting involved in the Kohana community and through that community we found people who are involved in the community and so it was very web framework centric at the beginning and then we just kind of branched out from there so the nice thing about having a technology specific meetup is the

opportunities kind of come in so rest was there Dorf was traveling through chicago and said where's the PHP user group oh yeah I'd like to present yeah that's like that's an easy win yeah those are a little tougher to come by you know when you're really praying for generic and for the listener shoes who is Russ oh he's at creator of PHP's Lee yeah he's the creator of PHP so that's

like being at the Ruby group in heaven mats come on being at the closure group and having her cheeky come out so it's a significant yeah he works for at Cena oh okay so making you know home homespun PHP yeah anyway good points about frameworks in you know a lot of the things that he was talking about even where applicable so even if PHP is not your main language I think a lot of

people would have been interested in that so two poses some challenges because you don't get as easy wins but at the same time I think exposing getting getting that caliber of person to present and exposing them to a wider range of listeners is a good guy i I'm a firm believer in listening to people who are creators which is why we're here and then I agreed even if you're a closure

person and you have a chance to hear somebody's created language and framework that says ubiquitous as PHP you need to listen you know it's they're going to at least tell you something yeah yeah absolutely in the technologies change so fast that even if you're on the cutting edge of say PHP you might have missed server-side JavaScript and a lot of and now functional languages and

yeah you know the advances that the roomie communities made specifically in micro frameworks and Python the same if you're not paying attention to any of that stuff you're probably missing out and paying attention to what other people are doing is a key fundamental way to advance what you do primarily so for this meetup what we're trying to do is we move it into professional software

development and software engineering practices because there's a there's kind of a gap between a formal computer science education and even if you come in through Codecademy or you know mobile makers def boot camps yeah exactly gen virus is what now yeah exactly so then they hope I get that right yeah they teach a lot of valuable things but the software

engineering environment is so complex they are a lot of things are missed and unless you have a good mentor unless you happen to work for a company who espouses a lot of professional practices you know you can just miss those things so we want to provide an opportunity for people to talk about ways to effectively develop software that aren't covered in classes and may not be covered by their

employers or maybe they're looking for a job looking to break into it and we want to teach the basics of things like continuous integration unit testing these things aren't taught in classes right of course you know in university classes and they're catching up but certainly when I was there they were attached it touching any of these things HT the basics of HTTP putting together

api's software process a lot of these things you just kind of thrown out there is a professional developer and unless you have the opportunity to come to conferences like a cna you can be difficult to pick those things up so we want to expand beyond PHP and talk about how to develop software in a professional environment effectively and so I think we have a better chance doing

that make you mean the wider exposure ordered yeah in the Y the biotechnology exposure and also yeah just refactoring ideas like hiring and you know using things like continuous integration Jen Meyers talking about developers doing design which you know if you basically giving people away from I'm a PHP developer mind stuff to you i'm a developer mindset yep so bring that

refactoring concept to so refractory your career overall exactly everything so depth from full stack it you know full stack from your from the way you think about approaching problems too what tools are now in your interpersonal for sure because so yeah you're missing something if your laser focused in some professions in some careers you know you can do that and

you're going really deep and that's fine and we want to learn for most people as well but most people i've found in the software profession our benefit benefit more from having a wide exposure and you need that to operate in an ecosystem that is diverse as most software engineering teams in small to mid range and even large companies these days so how does somebody found out about when

your next meeting is because it's probably gonna be after sure yeah so we just got it on twitter with the new handle reflect ORD as in Chicago O'Hare Airport ok so don't act re f a CT yep what more worthy ok I get refactor Chicago refractor to you in Chicago but we're on meetup refactored a Chicago comrie drop reader to the meetup site ok great well all those links will be in

the end the show notes well thanks again for taking that tiny smile with me it's great to meet you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today at you plastic calm you

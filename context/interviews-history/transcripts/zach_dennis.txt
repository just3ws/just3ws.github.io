hi Mikey with Udacity come here again and a cna someone sitting down with Zack Dennis zach is an interesting story is contributing author on the our scrapbook but he's also not on the our scrum team so how in the world did you go from not being an R Spec team death contributing to the r-spec book will see years ago I've been did a lot for his development and had really you know kind of latched

onto the r-spec in its philosophy that kind of the language you use infosys think about the world and I was just a very active community number about respect nihilist yeah in terms of how to apply different testing practices with our spec to image for partial presentations so you're looking at we had applied on this night not so much like think about it how you don't work

but how do I make it do what I needed to do yeah yeah it was still testing and the rest community is still pretty new and i was i think in at the right time to contribute a lot of ideas to the community and i think david kind of saw that and at one point you know reached alex at hey i'm working on this book i like you finished right on you know without the include a section on rails

that you be you know interested in contributing yeah so it's kind of interesting from his perspective that he didn't just saw her collaborate on a project and reticles event anything he sounds like he approached writing the book and say when you pushed working on our site but it was a collaboration many many hands there you got good to reaching for a

technology here but so he was like he's very welcoming of contributors healing people want us to write a new test a searching example a library or something well at that time that was before our spec to came out and before I think our specularly got the refactoring that David wanted to put into it to another several projects in all respect on occasion not scored on all of those

things so I respect was still at the model of the code base at the time and I think that he may have been actually that the maintainer and the only cork in her held on it brought in patches but I think it's more recent that more people have been brought in kind of escort you are spec but when he actually started the book not to get too much information whether he actually instructed it

actually had started before he took over our Shire probably my least the idea did and then when he became the maintainer and kind of for the author of our spec as you know today he's going to be charged with this book it was was a lot of work to clubs on and I think that's my impressionist that's when he reached out to people the community people he respected and

dominated one yeah and he had is he looked over the entire thing so it was that each person kind of did their own thing and that's it you know David was definitely the consistent voice indeed throughout the entire book it was but everyone else definitely contributed ideas and larger sections to their respective parts right I'm always ruins your suction again I worked heavily on

the rail section working the rails integration or just I think the last section of the book is just kind of our spectra dreidels when it walks through kind of outside none piece of cucumber labret and brian howell came actually or priority of those and then it got into use models controllers hovers and those are the chapters in section in Arizona because of what I think is really

interesting about your story is that it's not necessarily a person who the thing that makes these projects good and make some community projects is it isn't just contributions to the code which attests faxes sometimes those ideas that are fresh ways of working up and the way it's being used and we have been articulating their backs and if I huge creating so many it has kind of a life

cycle it comes out of this person premium and you feedback in tonight so that we may adjust or updating then there's a lot of ways teams are spec and it's impossible for one person to be intimately familiar with all of those different contexts where you used to like our spec and I think that's why he reasons why David progress kept to myself and to run is

what we have been doing a lot of Britain's work I don't know at the time you know where David was in terms of our respected ribs but we have been doing a lot of that right and i had so i thought you know that was something that during it's a Tibetan community and everything book well thank you very much bigger pants about me and you

hi i'm mike i'm here at Windy City rails again with Brian Lyle who is if you're in a ruby community you've probably heard some of the stocks or some of the fallout from some of his Twitter conversations with a certain other person is well known in the Ruby community oh one thing is you've been around kind of forever in a community any and you've presented at many many

conferences over the years ago kind of like how we have you seen things evolve or change in the community so so here's our here's a good way of putting it so let's go back let's start the beginning of rails 2006 I mean really first railsconf there was there was the candid on Rails before I'm gonna talk about that one so at that point we were we just learned that we were on something

and then as the years progressed we learned how to do something with that and then as the years progressed we got even better with it and now not only are we good at it we're good at making money with it yeah so I think that's actually we've basically evolved from hey look we have a cool toy now look how much choice make us yes so it's it's good it's kind of matured from oh this is a fun kind of

hobby neat we can do cool stuff to redo cool stuff and make money making cool stuff with the tools we like right we are actually living the dream how many people actually can say hey my hobby is my job and by the way I think paid a lot of money to do it and if I didn't like it right here I can actually pick up I could pick up shop and move somewhere else not many people can do that these

days and with with the op with the conference's though in particular your audience is mature you I mean even I've only been coming to rails conferences for a few years and I can see changes in the audience it is that affected I like your perception of working with that Rudy community or well I mean what's what's going on now is that we were we first started we were all getting good

together but now few years in actually at railsconf the last couple of years I just been getting giving beginner talks and the reason why because there's so many people that we forget that not everybody has been doing this for a long time and not everybody actually thinks like us and even understands why we think like we do so we need to give those lessons to those

people so I mean that's actually a really big thing to show how we are maturing is that hey there's a lot of people who don't know how to do this and have never even heard of rails before this year last year Wow yeah and you know and also you you you speak a lot of conferences if you do you have much experience working speaking at our user groups you know what um local I've

actually spoken it user groups in a few states yeah and actually crossed the pond over in Europe I'm actually I think I've actually approaching my 20th conference talk I do you think i think i'm approaching mad it's actually i'm smoking a lot and actually now i saw i spoke today about zsh who has nothing to do with Ruby yeah I'm actually speaking at the beginning of next month and

Belgium at our camp and I'm speaking at rubyconf and I mean how are you mean ours and the platform or no ours in a matey no ours and pirates yeah okay I Reese it's a ruby conference in Belgium and it's when I hear it's very good my first time there they're finding me there it's pretty awesome so yeah have you spoken at user groups versus speaking at do you ever use a tryout

material one thing there for people do is he like to know I'm like jay-z I don't even practice my talks I said I practice my talks don't practice my talks I never do I get up there and the only part you notice that I didn't cry other than even think about is the part that I was actually reading off of my tablet yeah I just thought of it I actually write my talks about a week

ahead of time I actually keep notes for months ahead of time I right to talk about a week at a time and when I look at before I talked and I said you know something i know i'm talking about let me just go up there to have a conversation with the crowd and that's what I did everything most of that talk was unscripted yeah yeah so you like to interested I mean a lot of people you

wouldn't recommend doing that no Danny did you start off being kind of like I'm gonna wing it kind of guy well no here's why I have a different outlook on talks either you're coming to edge you come and entertain most people forget about to entertain and they try to educate you know something in 30 to 45 minutes i'm not going to do much of anything but if I if I tell you about a

whole bunch of cool stuff that you could look at and then I tell a joke or two you're actually remember hey remember that funny guy I from that conference hey what was he talking about O'Brien said that yeah and that's what it is it's actually using the humor and using the personal like feel like I'm talking to you because I am talking to the crowd I feel like it's a mutual thing but I

use that to actually get my point across yeah and it's it's it's how you got to be normal said t.t a TFT is it but I don't yeah I mean I guess you know people know that I'm because it's it's memorable and it's a hawk it is a hook and actually that was the whole point the whole point right so that was the second time I gave that talk I actually gave it a little bit more serious the

first time he's talking about why people should be testing and then I gave it again as a lightning talk so I paired the top down and I said you know something it's the lightning talk I only have like five to ten minutes to give this so every other side I just put that's all the fucking time in there and it was like it was like really tiny type yeah every single time and many of

people like by the tenth time they saw they're like oh my god this guy's a nut yeah you know something it worked because I'll tell you what someone mailed me a shirt yeah actually I've had two shirts mail to me now with that logo or that on there that's like you know something that's great that I was able to inspire people to do this and that's why I continue coming out and talking

conferences okay well you know again I want to just thank you for taking a few minutes to talk with me okk she ate what you've all done oh thank you

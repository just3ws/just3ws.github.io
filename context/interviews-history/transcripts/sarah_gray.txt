user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with you tastic i'm at SC na 2013 and i'm sitting down with sarah gray who gave a talk yesterday morning on marc by marc and as long as I've done

three marc by marc some reflections on writing new worlds and i particularly this this metaphor you used for creating new worlds resonated with me because it was it was a book a children's book called Harold the purple n is Harold and the prepare and a brave man and he creates worlds with his purple crayon and well first thank you for taking the time stone with me and what was how did

you come to use a metaphor off of a child with a purple plan for software developments well thanks when I was thinking about my talk I was really I was focused on my evolution of of how I write codes and how I write tests and one of the things I've been focused on so much over the past many years and especially the last few years is using the tests as like a descriptive area to

write what I want the code to be before it exists so like the test files i'll actually be like what might be some names that i would want to name this thing and that just reminded me it's just like the sense of you step back from the framework and you step back from i have to write an active record model or i have to write an array and just be like what what do I want right

what should it be and it was like that book harold and the purple crayon us so much you know i mean it's so much love that because he's there and he's writing again and one of the things i was thinking about with us as developers that were writers right um that was i had thought about even making my top more focused on the fact that we're writers as developers than I did but

Harold is our writer and he's got that tool and he spends his whole time just describing things before they exist and it just felt so like that's what we do right and so just for me who might not be familiar with with the bull sure what what is what is the book okay so harold and the purple crayon is it's a children's book and it's famous I was around and I was a child it's around

now it's just like super famous and it's a very simple illustrated book with a small boy named Harold and he has a literally a purple crayon and every page it's like Harold wanted to take a walk so he drew a path yeah Harold wanted to go to bed so he drew a bed so it's like what does he want to do and he just draws it so it's this amazing journey of imagination and I McCann his imagination

gets away from and it gets away from him so he'll do like that like this big scary dragon and then he's like oh my god I don't know what to do and then he liked Drazen and ocean because his hand is shaking right we're like we talked about he draws a mountain and climbs up to the top and hadn't drawn the side down so he's he's like I'm gonna fall off the mountain and yeah I read that

book to my to my children and it's a favor to my son but I change it to be covered in the purple crayon nice and I actually you know it's it's it's so simple but I even feel a little dread when he falls off of the top of the mountain of the mountain but but you feel that sometimes in software when you're like oh this is great i'm sure i'm writing this thing and then you get

to the top and you fall down yeah now you realize you have your something to a great are you've written like so such a big structure then you don't know what yet with it right and then you're falling and then realize well that's right i got myself into this problem with software i can write so far to get out of it yeah exactly so so you took this book and did you have the book in

mind before the talk but in the talk started that unique the talk started and it was really the early ideas are on the top or really about how we r Howard writers like we sit at a keyboard whatever eight hours a day and like make characters which is that's right in and I don't but I don't think that we think of ourselves as writers in general as a community if I was like are you a writer

you probably would be like no I'm a coder right right and so that idea and just like thinking of references about how writing a program overlap just brought that book into my mind when it seemed like such a great Wow daddy and I financially in your previous starts you like to take concepts and try to illustrate them using simple animations and

illustrations I remember one where you were talking about how innumerable a little Factory in a little villein I see is that something that that predates software that you use these images and these these visual metaphors I think it is I think it's one of the ways that helps me think I didn't a lot of times when I'm looking at like a computer science concept sometimes I'll start to

feel just a little dumb or honestly just like I'm not sure how that works or that the space is so conceptual and it's such a two-dimensional space like that to help myself grasp things like I'm an experiential learning room a visual learner so just to help myself kind of i think experience with the thing is i will i will try to be like it's like this and simplify it so that i can

understand it and put myself in like like innumerable like it's a structure but like you just write some code again it's like flat to decode but it's like what if that was a three-dimensional string later how would it work and I think you know it's it's very funny that you were very appropriate that you chose heroin from program because when you were talking about that now I think of

Sarah and her mechanical pencil who's in the land of software Don and trying to take these concepts and dealing what's in these concepts termine introduced you and you say and then Sarah needed to uh go and create a list so how did Sarah do they had an unusual for all the the machine yeah that does it and then that helps you sure helps me learn like I think I'm such a physical

learner and being a physical learner in a software space is a little bit of a anomaly me it's not the normal way that I think people learner they spent for the dirt diverged encouraged to learn yep we are learning like that and and or and I just don't know it or I just need it so it's like my own learning aid well I think there is some kickback towards I mean when you look at stuff like the

design by we're watching yo was it a head start the head start the hell yeah without that try to use images and broken up layouts to be able to reach an audience that wasn't brought up in that purely kind of dry here's text here's example a nice ears example that might also got a context or or they're just a little bit ADHD and they're trying to thank these concepts to learn them in

that in a short order and it's already hard enough I think that there is movement towards breaking away from these stayed mm-hmm I don't wanna see outdated but their heritage seems to be from a lower academia and her in like academic texts yeah so so yeah so by moving away from that sand and being able to embrace it an entirely different type of type of learner I think there's

there seems to be a movement towards that end yeah I think what you're doing it's representative of of that's zeitgeist that the concept of trying to get away from just here's here's a there's a bunch of slides your some tag right right right and then I just come at you with a bunch of information and good luck and I've seen a lot of like I've been in the in like the blank face

position and I've observed a lot of people like also in the blank face position when you're like and it like what you just said here's a lot of slides here's a lot of text and before I hmm yeah and even you know and I've noticed people respond well when I when I break things out well there's there's a phenomenon where people where I don't know what the name

of it is but the it's it's where we it's almost like that a mass stereo where everybody is thinks they know something yeah and they think they understand and we're all looking at it together yeah they weren't you're the feeling I'm understanding it right but as soon as you walk away right like what did I just did was I and I think like individually a lot of people in those moments are

kind of like shit yeah really understand it and then when I do that I'm like how would I understand right so so taking it and taking that dry information and turning into something for your soul and then another it's been kind of a theme to some of the interviews is taking the information that would be for you and then when you just open it up and let other people see it okay then it can

become for everyone yeah yes and then yeah that turns into a talk and then it turns into attack well thank you very much for taking the time to sit on I appreciate it user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you cast accom

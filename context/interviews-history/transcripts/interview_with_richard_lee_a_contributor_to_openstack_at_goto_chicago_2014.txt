hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at go to cop 2014 sitting here with richard lee who is a contributor to the OpenStack project particularly the Heat's project which is a well he'll explain what that is well first thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me so what is the project and also what is OpenStack and how did you get involved with contributing to it so

OpenStack is the platform that allows you to basically host your own cloud ok so it's especially useful for companies on a host like internal cloud maybe your IT group to allow provisioning without going towards you no external cloud providers so I guess the heat project in particular is the thing that kind of orchestrates everything gets the orchestration engine okay so within

OpenStack there's a service for compute so you can watch your compute nodes for load balancers databases and heat is the thing that kind of binds it all together ok it's ok I want to watch a load balancer and I want to make sure that load balancer is connected to my server my service connected my database and provides kind of the whole mapping of it all is 8080 an acronym or is that a code

word that is as far as you know this is the name of the Justinian have you just just project code-named heat yeah so how did you end up contributing to that project is that something you were doing already without works or someone else before so I kind of got dropped into it just from project work yeah I'm actually previously working primarily Ruby on Rails and then just started going into

Python open sex pretty much entirely in Python and just from Project Work I started working on OpenStack got jumped into the heat project and just right now ok so you didn't have like a particular passion for this specific topic you just you saw an opportunity to contribute and then do something and you've come from being more of an app dev now to be working in this open sources have been a

little bit of a challenge and how you think or how you approach problems it's been very interesting because there's there's just a lot of pieces that I just didn't think about before especially like Ruby on Rails it was very easy to kind of ignore the entire seaworld so I'll just build my app I'll throw on the Heroku yeah and now it's very interesting seeing the way that I

guess deployments in general are moving with all these interesting tools along with OpenStack there's you know like salt dr. all these different kind of things that you can use and leverage and it's the deployment world is very interesting and OpenStack i think is going to be a big player in that right so it's it's a it's an interesting problem that when you were coming over

to python though you know you describe your part of the Ruby community you've been exposed now to Python community and the DevOps community has that been interesting getting and more exposure to a broader community so it's been it was very strange jumping in from Ruby to python right i think when i think of the Ruby community at at some point I was like you know I think I should start

maybe start writing a blog or you know trying to record my experiences just for my own knowledge and in the Ruby community everyone has blogged about everything 50 times you can find everything written in every different way and when I jumped into Python community it felt more like it was very much more academic and it was very very document based very you know you trying

to learn something to read the docs for this library for that library and there weren't as many people writing about this is how you use you know these two libraries that are very commonly used together right is how you connect it so that was those definitely a driver me to start like writing blog and kind of providing our more useful information the very personal experience if this is

how you use things right and then the DevOps community has been just mind-blowing for me it's just some right that's not something I've had to think about so far all right so what was in the particular that kind of was new for you when you we started looking at that community Oh within DevOps it's just how many different ways you can do a deployment yeah there's a lot I take one

just even you know a lot of people i think the the prevalence of chef and puppet have been dating deployments and then people are starting to shift to I was talking to Randy Shoop who was saying they're deploying process was they write puppet NFS and then they use Packer to create an ami and then they deploy the ham eyes and then I know the people that are

using docker for their deployments and then there's this he project for how you you know orchestrate at all you know similar to our other options out there like amazon's cloud formations out there there's so many different ways that you can watch what you want to learn i need a dev dev ops lab staff kind of thing so we can start to put these operation DevOps tools so we can deploy those so

we read eventually deploying application so if people wanted to learn more about OpenStack and the heat project work and they go and and or check out your work so you can definitely just give OpenStack website the wiki is very very full fledged and especially if you just go on to the OpenStack IRC channels there's one for every different project for Nova he all different ones and

people are very active very very willing to talk and converse okay great well thank you very much for taking that I'm sweet appreciate it um user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations opera of information find out for yourself today at Utah State calm

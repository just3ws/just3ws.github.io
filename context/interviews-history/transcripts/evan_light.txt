hi I'm Mike I'm again I'm here windy city rails and I'm talking with Evan light who runs the Ruby Dee camp or you created the Ruby Dee camper well anyway can you tell me a little bit about where we t camping and what you're what you're doing there well first hi because i'm a goofball okay so yeah he can't i created it i guess and 08 for a lot of different reasons i was frustrated with I I was

sitting in the audience at railsconf i guess it was in 08 and Chad Fowler was giving a presentation he was giving his kid out and he made one remark he said I don't do well in classroom environments and so I instantly blocked everything else he was saying after that and thought well I don't really either I don't imagine most of the people here either why are we listening to this yeah

and so I just kept thinking about that after that event I realized well then we've got soul conference model backwards we shouldn't have one person standing at the front of the room all the time but acer in front of a teacher in front of a seminar essentially the sometimes we have genuine experts in front of the room often we just have someone who maybe just learn something

you want to share about it so my question is really what makes these people so qualified to stand on stage and when you reflect on it and then this is awfully ironic may be hypocritical I'm talking about this at a conference i'm speaking at but the the speakers at conferences are chosen by a very select few individuals the people who run these conferences for any number of reasons

not necessarily because of some unique special confidence not necessarily for a reason that necessarily but who's the audience but it was those people who are running the conference so maybe better to instead of having a if you will an elitist group or an elite group an exclusive group choose who speaks at events that everyone should come gather together and share what's interesting to

them what's important to them and what they want to learn about and then grow together as a group collectively yeah that's a very perspective about the elitist I have to use a strong word i but no but it is it's the I've been guilty for myself I'll use a different word are different phrase hero worship yeah well or thinking about who's going to bring

people into the conference alright and that's that's that was the I aspect I was going to go out is that i know i've i've sat down and looked and said you know this person is really well known that this person is going to be somebody that people are going to see and they're going to bring more audience and make more value for the conference and which is a silly thing especially for a free

count well this is a paid conference i can't speak to that but doing free events it's you know who am i serving Welty camp wasn't originally free the first year it was more for a little more formal it had the basic format i described it was a hundred dollars because we had it at a hotel venue and then added all kinds of complication and it was Chris Williams from the

JavaScript community who would participated in the first decamped writer call actually he sponsored come to think of it he said why not hold a campground and that just hit me like a gold brick in the side of the hell and everyone camp well it's not just the word camp it's just I'm a bit of a tree hugger yeah we hugging hippie and yes see ya so we did it at a state

campground on the NASA was a panel to manassas battle think can't grant I guess or the battlefield park has a campground and we only had maybe 12 people stayed overnight but for those of us who stayed overnight during the camp it was a hell of an experience then I heard about this role playing game group that a few friends of mine participate in and they have a yearly gathering at

this cabin camp and I went to investigate it it actually has a cell phone signal surprisingly and I look at the space and thought this is just magnificent the price is eight hundred dollars for four nights yeah it has a professional kitchen walk-in freezer a roo sleeping room for 78 people right how much more perfect it had plenty of electricity we didn't blow any breakers

for two years we haven't blown breakers for two years now yeah I much more perfect to get so cheap yeah and it gets people out of their element and they get in it's just far enough from civilization principle in forest park in Virginia it's about maybe for a month 30 40 miles outside DC it's hard for people to leave it's just inconvenient enough for people to go home that even the

locals tend not to want to so we have three days three in three and a half days or so people stuck together in the same place yeah and I can be really powerful yeah but also being out in the greenery is it's got to be enough of disruption of what your typical mental state is inside of a building instead of artificial lighting you know you're you're out and your screen and there's

there's the big zoo room yeah yeah that's right laconic shirt but yeah well yeah yeah the Big Blue Room that is the great outdoors but yeah it sounds like it it kind of breaks routine it breaks a rigid expectation of how a comfort should be and that's what we try to do across the board okay and I do would you do anything without trying to bring in local user groups or at dads well at

first I tried to market if you will I sent emails out to user groups up and down the mid-atlantic and I because I lived in the metro area lived in Northern Virginia most of my life I knew a lot of people in that area so I talked to them the most in the first few years was mostly local people but I'd always had the intent to try to make it being necessarily in size but in terms of

reach because again i feel like the model the conference model just doesn't seem right especially for a group as diverse as the Ruby community I do think that we are somewhat unique and special snowflakes as a community for better or worse in that I feel like rubies a very expressive language it tends to attract slightly unusual people may be a little bit smarter than the average bear but

maybe you could say that about anyone who goes to a conference and or people who are more interested in the average bear people who know more than the average bear it if that's the case why are we just lecturing at them though I already said that yeah well it's it's it's interesting perspective is its knowledge as it's just it's just it's just knowledge until you put into action

and a lot of times are coming to a conference and we get knowledge but no action but one of the other aspects that I'm troubling me about the conference environment is a lot of people i found this about myself years ago a lot of people go to the conference is not for the presentations because you see let we were talking about this moment ago before we roll camera you see people

with laptops open typing away all the time they're not really paying attention so why are they there they're not really there for the presentations they're there for the other people or what sometimes we call the Holy track so the idea then was well let's make something that's essentially starting as a hallway track and then I had a few other people egged me to go in certain directions I

was originally thinking something that was less controlled in a conference but even then I was still holding on just a little too some control I have very very little control you're just setting the stage right now for the event we go so far as to bring supplies which I used to be solely responsible for acquiring them now we have so many people who participate that I'm just making sure

people are talking and I might not even have to go fetch anything this year which I usually do so let me back up really the whole metaphor Stone Soup videos everybody keeps or a lot you tell you okay so the story is don't sleep I guess it started in France during some war or another some soldiers walk into a town and they have nothing to eat at all the people in the town are very poor but

the soldiers say the soldiers come up with the idea of well I'm going to get this big pot put some water in it we have this magic stone that'll make the food taste really good but if you put a little bit of something else in there it'll make even better yeah and then so the townspeople started contributing a little bit a little bit a little bit by the time by as individuals the next

thing they had this magnificent meal decamp works exactly like that the first year or i guess the second year when we really what I went to costco loaded up my father subaru outback because my car can't load as much stuff but all supplies at costco dragged him out there dragged and my father drank this grill out there i did a lot of lugging around

but but what happened on site is that i would start to do some work and then people would say oh evans doing this by himself let's help ya and then before I knew it I be just step back and they would do it yeah and where is this year we've evolved to the point where occasionally similar to walk up to me and say do you think I should do so instantly do you want to yeah and then

sometimes even better someone would just go into the kitchen and just start cooking because they were hungry great yeah yeah I love it I don't want to have to do any of this I shouldn't have to do any of this I try not to be benevolent dictator I want people to just do things together Vanel of it been benevolent facilitator well that's the goal yeah that's the bowlin I think I moat I think

we as community are mostly there now and I say community because decamp is a tendency to draw a lot of previous attendees back I'm not the only one is very passionate about and I just started that way but I guess you could say I've sold her they've sold each other on the idea that it's not just my idea now it's our idea and so this year I have people coordinating on what supplies to buy

what they are going to cook because we've got some really enticing people when it comes to making food yeah I think about that all too much but really when you start with hot dog buns and some sugar and some other things you have a guy come out with this amazing bread pudding it's hard not to be blown away by the creativity and love that goes into it and that was just

implemented the whole event last year and that's pretty much what it's like now everything is is a communal effort and usually I don't have to start any of it now they just they know something to get done someone starts doing it other people see him they help so I'll say it on a camera now oh my god I don't think I've done this before it's basically a socialist experiment than a few days

yeah yeah that's big a little cousin work yeah it can mean it really is essentially economy just a wee drop in the supplies the beginning occasionally resupply during from a central budget if you will I just break the checks two people okay so I handle it so I'm the Politburo I control the checkbook but there really isn't the know unless we don't have

money right because people are very reasonable about their expectations usually collectively and things get done yeah and I you know just kind of thinking about going as a conversation also that we had a little bit before I just kind of switching gears I know that you're also very involved with looking ads and you've been vocal about equality at the conferences and and seeing a

mixed audience of people that it's you know traditionally a white male young audience that conferences is that something that uh I'm sure you hit you have an opinion on and could make comments on have you seen like a change over the years with with any kind of attitude towards women and people who would otherwise be considered minorities at conferences I've seen collectively

over the whole of the conferences in the Ruby community a trend toward reaching out more railsbridge was has been around for a few years now that that's a woman's outreach group essentially I've seen more average toward minorities I'm proactively trying to get more minorities involved more women involved it and it's not that I shoot for quota but I know worthy people might be people

i know people who are passionate who are interested or and/or are extremely talented and there are a lot of people i found that Ruby community so we don't have to bring out representative numbers we can skew them just a little bit why not because we are stronger I've always been a very big believer that we're stronger for diversity monoculture is death and so having more women involves

a good thing having more minorities involves a good thing more perspective more disagreement as long as it's constructive is a good thing okay and I but I mean what I was what I was trying to get at is is is the well I sure can't remember what I was gonna die well then that's ok cuz that happens every now and then but thank you very much heaven for taking the time to

fix mic

hi it's Mike review tastic up here go to comp 2014 I'm standing here with Alex and Joel who just gave a talk about limo pairing I actually what was the title exactly of the talk again the title of the talk was the best of both worlds remote area in action so our with iron without pain without the other so well first thank you for taking the time to speak with me up so the stomach were

where is this coming from and what was the topic about I mean what I mean is repairing but what about women pairing well we have both been working for a company that is a start-up that's entirely remote for the past year we've been working there and everyone at the company of pairs remotely and it's a very new concept most people work in an office or they work from home by

themselves and so we want to expose people to this style of working that allows you to have an interaction with people but also allows you to have more flexible schedule and work from your own environment okay and so in the talk were you giving tips or just more sharing attic double experiences yes it was more like the latter where we talked about like the antidote experiences the tools

we use some of the ones it's not like we're saying hey you use this exactly it was you know we tried this it didn't work or worked well this is why and all the stuff that you know just helps make it our day-to-day lives easier so we can focus on actually writing code Oh in the types of applications are you writing on the web applications windows applications what platform are you

starting from yes they're mostly web applications online some backend stuff to for our clients and we aim to get everyone using them on Chrome but it's still are stuck with somatic users as well sorry that doesn't die more for the developers who are working in the team or are you saying that there's developers and the team but are still working in like different oh no the

developers in the team we mostly develop our applications for Chrome okay and everybody's probably what running macbooks are you a windows shop yeah so we actually have a pretty standard setup where everyone has a macbook pro and two Thunderbolt displays just so when your screen sharing you can kind of have the other person's screen up and also still have room to maybe Google some stuff on

yours um and you know everyone seems to be pretty happy with you know some Linux flavor some people might refer actually using a boon to but max close enough that everyone can be happy with it right and so you're working collaboratively your teams are remote I mean are you global remotes were we are we try to stick within the four US time zones

right now because we try to stick with a consistent work day in four hours for everyone but that might change in the future but right now we are spread across the entire continental United States and that the events extreme because it brings to the next question I was thinking about us office hours and and having collaborations that strictly developers work it out between

themselves or do you have like you said in office hours kind of so right now we pretty much are collaborating the entire day we start at 9am central and they just kind of go to the day end but obviously like sometimes our team is an odd number someone's out or someone's got something going on or just wants to work by themselves for a little bit that day so we kind of make it work we are as

we get more people on the west coast and our team becomes this collaboration of people across multiple time zones we are kind of having to move to that the core hours concept where like a try and be on line between these hours so we compare then and then either para somebody in your time zone at the other end or maybe just work on learning something new yeah and that's interesting you're saying

about para with somebody in your time zone where I wondered if there was some kind of striping maybe across time zones work because people just overlapped more they collaborated more we haven't gotten to that point yet but we are growing so rapidly that we've gone from 1 to 50 to 1 to 25 developers 50 employees over the past year and so if we start to get very contingencies and it's time zone that

might be somewhere away there we go and you alluded to some tools that you use what is what is uh you describe it every developer has two monitors that way they can they compare and chat what are some of the other tools that you use and recommend um so we use right now we're just using OS X screen share for screen sharing I know there are a lot of other tools out there one of the other ones we

liked was screen hero as you said you've used that bull our we also use what's called zoom for video conversations it's similar to Google Hangouts that you can just quickly add people and people can drop seems to be a little bit better on your computer in the long run and then we also use slack which is just a kind of like IM chat where you can have group oh it's like the hip chat yeah it's very

hungry live chat so it's persistent you can search it you can have different groups you can email Rin someone directly um so those are the biggest choice we used I miss anything for our task boards and for transparency between the different groups we use Trello so they don't think I'd of an online agile task board type system where you have user stories and you can move them

across and see what you're working on right and when you're you're doing your rgr use innovation planning meetings and things like that or how do you structure so on a day to day basis you know people pair off and probably I'm presuming have a daily kind of had known heavily on Stan or sit down whatever the case might be but do you how do you structure work in a longer cycle um we so far have had

minimal structure basically as the business finds more features being implemented they will just add them to the prioritized column more recently because work is piling up basically in different areas we want to keep our task board more clean and so we've tried to move more towards one week iterations but still minimal process we have a brief meeting where we move some cards

over into the next week's work but not a lot of in previous jobs we've had long strip planning meetings and things like that we don't want to get into that so we believe so try to keep it a little low flow formality yes yes live in a and you know from your presentation did you present any specific tips or or it falls the tree so the biggest pitfalls are like we said the time zones and

whiteboarding solutions I you know and when you're working in an office somewhere it's really easy to just draw on a whiteboard I'll kind of get that going it's a little bit harder remote and mainly it's only harder because those tools are either like ipad specific and so they require having an ipad or as things we use like zoom and slack are free so it's kind of like

let's have this low overhead okay um as far as tips we kind of like we just try something see if it works you know and just don't stick to it let her don't you know don't say you have to use this know if it doesn't work try something else and be open for experimentation don't be too dogmatic because a lot of this stuff is kind of new I mean the technologies are new the whole idea of remote working

is yes kind of new well thank you very much for taking the time to speak at me I really appreciate it Thank You Carrie talking dear Rach enjoy the conference will do user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you cast a calm

you

hi I'm light with you gastic sitting here at the Windy City rails with Eric macadie who runs the Chicago Java users group and he's starting up the Chicago Ruby testing group hi Eric thanks for taking a moment to the top of me so go from Java to Ruby that sounds like kind about those communities are notoriously different so what's what's been your experience with between the two well the

lot of the Java jobs here in Chicago tend to be with a lot of trading firms and a lot of more established like insurance firms and Ruby is and there are some startups here that use it i'm and i was with the startup that use Java for a while and there's a guy here you guys the other thing from grubhub kind of a startup and then you know Ruby is so I decided you know Java is on one

side of the predominant on one side of that continuum in Ruby's a little more on the other side like a lot of startups oh you don't see too many startups using Java but you want you see a few but then you also see Ruby starting to get it to establish companies as you know and like I said you know Java is really big in the finance space here in Chicago there's a lot of trading firms the jug

is hosted at cme mostly i have a contact eric if he says there's no space available i gotta scramble but yeah he they tend to do a lot of stuff and forget especially if we get some like low-level like a guy from oracle came and talked about like memory garbage collection and then that was packed yeah when you say packs what's packed well we use gathers us yeah for rsvps right now

and we have a limit of 50 since we're free and so usually we hit we hit that limits you have to wait mistake and then yeah one time we also had to start another event and then seeing me also does it internally and so we get like maybe 50 60 people when I started running see jug we are meeting up in loyola your John Hancock mm-hmm and we were

getting like in addition to the speaker like maybe two or three people yeah and then I moved in a you know funny they say like in real estate location is the most important thing that's true for user groups because we went to thought works for a while we had a few more people and then I moved it to see me which a lot of people like because in a gala people work in the loop and they

live out in the suburbs and see me he's like right in between there okay and so it's you know a lot of people who said they loved it we did release a survey on SurveyMonkey only 12 people responded and there were people who said they didn't like seeing me but they didn't have in common well I must let him in the same people that liked it my most people like it like I said that mean

location is definitely an important thing and I talked to someone in sears tower and I was kind of like I don't think I want people don't want to get patted down right just for a lecture I mean see me is like I said I mean judgment is my contact and he's really been great and really helped us out a lot okay great and so yeah what is driven you to once you go towards

creating this Ruby testing her because there's there's a lot of testing business going on inside of Java with makito and some really neat stuff going on in there but well I personally am getting more into Ruby yeah i mean honestly I'm running the Java group now because honestly think if I were to just drop it it would die so I'm trying to find someone to replace it and there you

know that does seem to be demand for a Java group here in Chicago it is a little frustrated because nobody ever wants to run it as you know you know running a group but you know we like I said we have we've had meetings we've had quite of people show up so like I said there's definitely demand for a Java group in Chicago and I just been going more to the root excuse me to the

Ruby groups and I was at bank of america for a while I got laid off and like every what I did was at the bank I like no technology social network I like we build it from scratch as I started going to summit I just went to a ruby meeting and then things can venture kind of rolled on from there and so like I said getting into the Ruby world and as far as stunning Ruby testing

group you know I also went through code Academy and you know everyone talks about how you know you should always write your tests firsts for all your code for your applications but nobody really spends much time talking about testing you go to the different user you the different meetings like the last one was about Ruby motion yeah how often do you have a meeting about our spy or

something right you know and if we were gonna running with another runnels with another code Academy Alumni afonso rush what kind of be tooling it right now but kind of a little bit we won't want to start back up again but we just kind of thought you know like everyone talks about you should code test first you know maybe you should do languages test from the first oh yeah essentially

morning onwards via the testing I don't know that's really a practical but that's kinda thought that occurred to us because like in the you know code Academy you get people like like Afonso and I who would been to other languages and it using the kind of transition to Rails and they all said people be like well now it's start early yeah and the people who don't know nothing about

coding and but they don't really cover testing very much of course all the employers want testing so we're trying to you know like build like a little curriculum to kind of lead people through our spec since that's kind of the main definitely seems to predominate more than test units right and were hosted right now at a company called open software integrators which is

primarily Java shop erotic laid off because one of their founders is a guy named Andrew Oliver he was down in North Carolina he wrote of the boyfriend work which is a job of framing the list java developers read and write office files the open office here in chicago i just met the guy here in chicago office his name is Patrick French and he really wants to help build the community as

well as he's there hosting its and so yeah we're kind of you know of course this testing can have a lot of religion you know there's people like like dhh like half the time he's tweeting about how much he hates ours back right right we're going with our spec because it's definitely more predominant and you know like I said come any other like a curriculum we're trying to even like

maybe get some people in local people and I know someone at backstop City want to come talk about mocking I kind of got like give the lectures about their their experiences and the guy started gathers us a couple them were obscene and then we came groupon in the morning log that they started because not only do they want some of the that did RSVPs but they also wanted to get experience with copy

bara mm-hmm have them come in and maybe it maybe talk and so we're trying to get like some we wanted to be like maybe a six week course so you're thinking more less just a formal user group but more of a study and learn group kind of that here that's kind of because like nobody really they don't see you too many tutorial groups in a sense of its really kind of like this you know we're on the

third Tuesday the month and we're going to talk about this and then we're all going to disperse for another month and so if you do like more of a tutorial it's like if somebody misses oman a week they're kind of behind and then we also thought it would look good with the r-spec book and then one of the things about the arts macbook is of course if you if you looked at it the first

section is all about cucumber practice rights likewise are called the arse back walk of course David chillin skis here maybe he can answer that question so we're kind of retooling things and you know but if I if you know my I'm going to jump back to what you said earlier about the show the networking look of it that you were working in a company and he had so much invested in those people

in that those relationships at the company that once that's run away you're like oh I have no network yeah and where its user groups and conferences you get to meet people and talk to people and build up that's kind of kind of not work I mean that's is that something that's looking back at you know the Java group has been useful in the past two new people it'sit's helps it's also kind of

let me you know if you run a group you kind of have what you call presidents privilege in a sense that I can I'm a kind of introverted of guy I feel more comfortable walking up to a group leader and saying I run the Java group you know like talking to ray I was hoping to talk about you know because I mean I think the stereotype and this is country for me is like a lot

of developers are kind of introverted it's like because I actually and sometimes what about the Java group you know I will kind of like introduce myself to be able to thank you for coming and then I was at another event completely you know not really technology and I just got stay off the corner by myself like I should go to talk to you and I stopped with something

like that would seem really weird yeah there's some guy just introduced something like it's okay for me is the host of the leader of the Java group you know so as far as networking yeah like I said I mean a lot of the other Bank I mean I would be going to the Java group for a while but a lot of the people that I was like the only bank person there yeah so like I said it was kind of

almost like these two separate worlds in a way but yeah like I said it was it was kind of hard be building from scratch and going to use groups really helps and you know like I said it's a kind of cliche being involved in user group helps you know it's it's somewhat i'm running a user group it's sometimes like living paycheck to paycheck yeah it's like okay I got something for next one

yeah and then like you know two weeks you two weeks before the presentations like someone but one thing that's happened is you do it over time you know eventually people kind of start coming to you yeah yeah that's one thing the problems that I've seen in user groups is that people they start a user group and then out for a few months you realize it's kind of hard to get people

to cooperate people to do what you need but once you've gettin gotten through that that um that's a initial trial period you start to build up and then people sort of recognize oldest group it's been around a little while so sometimes powering through it you know those those lean times yeah the Java group we kind of have the advantage we only have to come up with actually 10 /

stations a year because we meet the third tuesday so no one's going to come into some yeah and then October we have there's the no fluff just stuff which is like it's kind of like there's a guy in Colorado of his name's Jason Furman he basically his company does they point of like little mini Java once or three and what he does is he will send excuse me speakers to Java groups throughout

the country and raffle off a couple of tickets yeah so October he sent someone out to us so that's one month we don't have to do anything right and so we just had to compete was trying to be like 10 I'm sure the Ruby group probably doesn't mean in January because they're the first Tuesday and it's so close to the new year so I would say if you're started user group try to be at the end

of the month or the beginning of the month because it's actually a little less work that way okay yeah I first I run right and smacked Avenue Mall of the month so i guess i am and I've noticed people love to do things on Tuesdays yeah yes use a service even if even if I do things like non tech related like I kind of thought about look going to like looking into like going to some buddhist

meditation groups Tuesday Tuesday everybody does everything onto yeah I know what it is about tuesday yeah so I hadn't thought about it but the my group has been more successful on Tuesdays as well so ya know well I r we thank you very much Eric for taking the time to talk with me

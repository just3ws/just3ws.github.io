user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's my colleague on here with you tasik today I'm coming from the go to conf in Chicago I'll go to Chicago I'm sitting down with Haddie hariri who is a

well your developer evangelist with jet brain and one of the talks he was going to be giving today is on I'm being a antisocial geek is Harper which i think is actually very thematic for what you cassock is and it's trying to support people who participate in community and get out from behind the desks so you know thank you again for sitting down with me what what is an anti-social geek

if we don't already know what it is and why is it wise at home well that's alright so there's there's a you know there's easy is an easy way to get a talk into the conference with a catchy title yeah it's not that anti that we're antisocial I mean if you define antisocial to someone that wants to disrupt and be aggressive towards others and their rights we're not we're not

anti-social we are antisocial in the sense of we're not really you know into socializing as much as I'll start misanthropic it's just a live only network so the the talk is much more about communication and interaction between developers right and it's it's more about the experience that I've had over the 20-plus years of interacting with different developers with different

teams having run my own company and seeing the problems that communication or lack of it pauses between developers and and it's you know often you find like in our industry it's become common to say that you know in developers are introverts right developers you know don't don't mind him you know steve is great at developing but you can't really

talk to him right and I think that we are ignoring this and we're kind of accepting no way you can talk to Steve as opposed to trying to find out why you can't resist it by now why you can't talk to certain people or why there's so much friction when you're talking to certain people and what happens is that we end up with teams where certain people certain individuals are isolated

and and that I feel that impacts the team it impacts the the code it impacts the company it impacts the goals everything and just happiness happiness that you're kind of pigeon-holed into this year a developer therefore you don't want to talk to anybody your developer therefore you just want to sit in a dark room in it something I've seen this culture of we also in the dark room

and nobody talks and then we all want lunch and then everybody just chat chat chat chat which kind of leads me to believe is that people actually do want to talk and they do want to share but we have the stigma or this preconceived notion the way we're supposed to act yeah i mean we're we're great I mean it's not that you know it's a myth that developers entrance they're not interest

what what we don't like enough to discuss this in my other talk the prima donna on that I talked about is that we don't like small talk I want to have the first time I said that to me gay got talk someone said to me what do you have against the language small talk no just like yeah right yeah uh we don't like small talk so we we love to debate we love to just sit there and you know

debate things on end and bring our points and make sure that we have the last point and we're right sometimes we don't realize that it's time to back off sometimes we don't realize that it doesn't matter of you know making a concise point about something it's we miss the big picture right and it's I kind of feel it's these skills that often we lacking yeah right

because we you know like I I think that it's very good for developers to work and technical support because you learn to deal with customers you learn to know when to back off you know when to concede to say okay well you're wrong but I'm not going to tell you you're wrong or because of this because it's in the end it's just not worth the battle it's not worth about it and what happens

is that with teams when you when you're with someone that is constantly trying to prove its point it ends up that you like okay we'll just do what if you want you know and that do whatever you want going to impact your product it can impact yours whatever you're developing but you're like what it's not worth the friction to to dispute or debate with this guy okay and there's a lot of

people that don't realize that at some point it's it's better to back off it's better to you know again not miss the the the point that we're trying to do right well what is it that we're we're here for ya recently myself I've had to work in a non developer role and getting to see most dealing with HR people are getting to see how different because what you described about the way

developers tend to talk or more amongst of the developers and then going into a human resources where it's very much not as is rigid his development they have rules and they have their protocols but the mode of conversation as much difference or I'm mostly casual but it is different and I'm struggling to clear a product it is because you know we are we try and

apply our coding principles to our conversations like dry yes why do I have to review myself or say the minimum possible for it to be efficient you know like an ultimate efficiency when we speak and sometimes it's not about efficiency right sometimes it truly is about talking about the weather or some nonsense or whatever to break the ice to to try and understand the other person

right and that's one other thing that I feel that is lacking a little bit in the developer word world which is can conveying emotions like you know we don't have a lot of empathy often right I mean you've seen no doubt you've been involved in open source right and recently there was some some lady that had put up some code on open source and there was such a backslide backlash on

it on Twitter like who would put up rubbish like this and when you get high profile people putting things like that yeah it hurts people and we don't think about these things you know we don't think about how our actions in the goal of saying that something is right or wrong can end up hurting other people yeah in its kind of interesting hey how you are describing that I don't see it

black about the feet but it sounds like more of a underused empathy muscle yeah um that yeah we can relate to each other but we haven't many of us haven't developed that that that skill dealing with other p in a more benign way I'm thinking of in HR role I've had is working with developers and sauron boarded it trying to get people who've only been at a

company under seven months or so to talk to somebody who's starting today in when I'm talking to the person who's only six seven months there they think well I don't know enough to be able to give useful information to this person and I don't wanna say it's a lack of empathy but they they don't remember how to advertise with what it was like to be that new person and realized that they

do have a lot of experience that they could share that could be useful for that that person and it's it's a camp for themselves back in that role of not knowing it's like like as adults we forget what it's like to be child it's if you're a parent it's it's hard sometimes it's our number but it's it's an it's an empathy deficit it seems like now as a developer evangelist you have

to deal with a lot of people i'm sure yeah so you know dealing with communities head servant has that has this view that you have down that and where this talk came from and and even the prima donnas talk to you you mentioned earlier is that coming from your experiences largely dealing with so many varied communities down that job on PHP Ruby JavaScript well hi fine yeah

but I mean I'm you know I'm not gonna bad enough the developer community far from it because i'm still a writer for myself but i feel that there is a little bit of a lacking I mean I you know I I i work at i work at a lot of conferences and i stand a lot of and I see that it's very often it's hard to engage conversation with people because people are shy to come up and

say you know like what do you do or ever and so I have found it but but more than as and as evangelists coming across this it's been more my experience with with teams that I've worked with or terms that are born on right and it's more about the actual root problems that often there have been it in teams and I've learned to deal with people more openly and be kind of like in a more

open than a lot when I was dealing with customers when I had to talk to customers own and that's why I say I mean customer support is is one of the best things that developers should do I mean I have had to deal with customers you know doing technical support in isp where you know the guy would call and say I can't send email you would say are you connected to the Internet and he

would say I don't want to go to the internet i want to send Lee now right you have to learn to deal with yeah and it gives you patience and it teaches you how to talk to people because you can't hang up the phone and say you're too stupid to send me quite you come when anything is is again a ghosted empathy remembering that once upon a time you were no same boat you may have been a

child when it happened but once upon a time you did not know what the internet once and trying to remember that one up in this this reminds me of the a scenario I experience in the military where I was dealing with a bunch of new recruits and asking them where they which which jobs they were going to be taking and of course your mom was a medic and one was going to go to

language school almost going to be in an MP and the other one was kind of setup I'm just remember in it kind of took me back she was she was really like yeah you know I'm not as good as these other people and he just not she also kind of for the other I'd forgot that she wasn't providing a very valuable service and did what she was doing was important and that she was a human being and head

value and it when we're looking at our ivory towers we have these very fancy jobs were senior engineers and we're we have these very illustrious titles and forget that we couldn't have that without the truck driver who carries the computers that there were all part of the sudden if that customer didn't call in and say I want to send email I don't want to get on the internet if it wasn't

for that person that we wouldn't even we wouldn't even be able to exist in much like the truck driver you couldn't even have an immaturity without having the truck or we could bring this stuff supplies well the fact or DeMarko that was the chips to get on the computer that you're using every day and it's every every and it's that we just is part of the ecosystem then did you know

the mean if we can remember that maybe it might say I was a humble but just be more aware that you definitely think there's there you know there is that that missing in the developer community I think we need we all need to be a little bit more humble we all need to come down back down to earth and think about what we are doing as part of a global picture as

opposed to our personal goals and there was an article recently in fact on fingers on Forbes or somewhere about whether we are they were putting a comparison of are we the Lindsay Lohan or are we the Meryl Streep of the of Hollywood you know as opposed to are we in this startup business of getting venture capitalists and cashing out quick or are we there to try and really

change the world and grow up business and grow it steadily and I often find that we're kind of moving towards that big you know hotshot Hollywood grown-up thing right oh yeah it's it's the team the rock star the ninja I will enjoy yeah yeah it's already fantasy film roll up and it hits again that's that desire to press hold up on a higher pedestal and stuff realizing okay we're a part of

an ecosystem that we can't do these things without each other that's one of the reasons that I want to support and make these organizers and conference organizers people that bring people together that's one of the reasons I do these interviews is to help expose them to support to support the people that build the community in realize that we're in this kind of

together it's more fun to do together that they do a long plays a role groans important yes well thank you very much for taking the time thank you really appreciate it yeah thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations passera of information find out for yourself today yeah cute esta com

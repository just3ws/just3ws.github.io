I hi it's mike with you tastic i'm standing here at groupon and i'm sitting here with Chris Whitaker who is with the Civic Whitaker project which is he works with a bunch of different projects on open government I Code for America thank you very much for taking the time to you to speak to me last time we spoke you were a captain with the code for america

or quote from America Khobragade what what was that again in and what has changed since then so the code for america is a nonprofit organization that focuses on technology and saves they have three major programs they have the fellowship program which they bring a team of fellows to a city in mentem for city hall for a couple of weeks and they all go back to San Francisco to work on

building a solution for that city oh so they're actually they actually work in in hand with the government it's not just oh we're looking to make the eyes it's like okay so that's the sort of the main full-time program fellowship applications are open if you want a spindly here helping cities it kind of has a full-time job but after having a year of fellowship program the Pope

American got a lot of interesting people saying hey you know I don't have time to take a year away from my life but I still only involved in what you're doing so come from America launched the brigade program which I became involved in I'm the Code for America gay captain for the city of Chicago okay so that looks like a user group organizer or like you're the main organizer for

Chicago I'm the local Pony contact pressure dropping Chicago is unique in that it has a lot of energy around civic innovation you have opened up Chicago which has been leading since 2009 you have the squad Chicago collaborative which is done tremendous work in the city and then you have a city hall that curse or gets the civic innovation and has a whole team of people opening up

data for my involvement with the local group here is I hope organized the open up headlights that take place every tuesday at 1871 which is what if Chicago's torque its basic somewhere it's one of our big startup think well that's not an incubator but it's in some places start space yeah it's a big next is some of all different people who are starting up new companies

and are just reading and sharing ideas so all right so you're doing these these hack up nights and you're you're doing a point of contact as your role since the last time you spoke over a year ago is that has that changed or how was that about so just recently I was named the Code for America appliqued coordinator for the Midwest oh ha the previously the captain positions had been a voluntary

now cohf America's entered a contract with my company Civic Whitaker to help one Brigade in the Midwest okay also is it's now it's it's one of a full-time or released a paid position there are some funny to it Oh so what I'll be doing is not only will i be continuing my work here at chicago but i'll be hoping to start new brigades and help supporting existing brigades all across the Midwest

okay so when you say Midwest or what kind of because robust means different things for different people are anything not touching the ocean mmmm but certainly the Michigan Ohio Illinois Indiana not go south dakota sort of a large sort of a large oar bit less data sets and it's sort of amorphous but certainly there's already a number of brigades on the existing in my question

Detroit Twin Cities you know Grand Rapids you have Rockford Illinois so not only will be supporting those but will be creating new brigades and actually attempting to have Brigade at some of the university's University Michigan University of Illinois so giving the people involved in an awareness of the stuff right at the university level right Chicago has run rather than

Midwest has just a rich pool towel you've got on University Michigan University of Illinois of the final University just all whole bunch of research-based institutions and we're going to try to get that time tap the talent into the larger game right so what are some of the projects like you described that there's there's a subtle cities do you guys collaborate on

projects between or is it because is each city's government kind of unique and they kind of work independently well I imagine that each city will kind of have it so tell some tales but so in city will be a little different but it'll definitely be a lot of room for collaboration that's been one of the great things about beige part of the code for america brigade network is you

know if you have a question or you want to put an idea out there you put it out in the email list and not only are you contacting people within your community but you're hitting the email inboxes of people all across the country will rise from working on this as well and the rough around the world one of the things that happens as last year is code for america has gone international with

brigades in poland japan and in are they so visit their own like is it now code for hawaii code for japan it's cold okay so we have code from aggregated island cove america we gaze at tokyo that's gonna be having confusing us I pramerica I'm Irish yeah well that's one of the actually reasons why they have decided to to do a Midwestern pilot region used it when I first started it was literally

12 people around a table and now it's grown to twenty-something brigades and starting organizations and 53 communities and it's just keep going growing exponentially right and so it sort of make that management process a little easier and help scale it on they decided to do a pilot regional brigade so to kind of help coordinate efforts across across the pit so this is

something that's that's been exploding over is you describing one from being a handful of people to now it's national coordinated organization look sick let's take a step back though let's go back to that 12 people around the table how did you even get involved with that with it at that time what was what was the beginnings of civic hacking for civic Whittaker well one of the things

that I at the time I was working for the state of Illinois and the bump on the rocks okay so if you needed a file for an appointment or if you have probably done plenty claimed you would end up coming and st. me and Felix and I initially started getting into a sitting ovation sort of that love a lot of frustration with the technology that I had but you mean you are working in in

India say your code or working ok you know GM with papain yeah and I actually still don't do a lot of coding to this day in a lot of what I do is its organization all that storytelling ok but the system that i was using to administer on plane benefits was both 1973 yeah and so I was broken 1975 that's 1590 of hold as it really is it's it was sort of crazy because I would you

know reached in my pocket pulled out this thing this thing has more power than did my system I use this watch cameos so I'm frustrated me that sort of the tool that I have to administer you know public benefits things that you know should be at their best which is total crap so I started going to hackathons and Technology events to try to get a better sense of okay how do i

harness all this brand spanking new technology to in order to do my work better so shortly after i joined the Code for America brigade they had sent out email saying you know or accepting applications for the initial class of captains and I had sort of a pipe as wanted to get involved shortly after i joined the became a captain start doing consulting work for the

smart Chicago collaborative which sort of accelerated all the things that are he's doing and it just sort of all leveled out from there yeah then just for those we've mentioned the smart Chicago collaborative that's Dan next one'll tis we also have interviewed so go check that out i'll link to it but uh i think it's a fascinating though that you went from being somebody who I think

about people that are I've been in in the office pool myself and it can feel frustrating and disempowering and disengaging to be in it but it looks like you were able to find an outlet your passion was able to find people that could help make your pain lasts Ortiz solve some of the problems I mean that was as like kind of like an aha moments like wow I found people that are

all not only passionate but they can help execute on these things are well certainly sort of being involved in Chicago's open gov community you sort of opened my eyes to sort of i'm not alone in thinking that things can be better off and particularly once i got sort of on twitter with a gun to Cornell has tagged and gov lupin some of the other communities that sort of merge the

technology at not the civics space and once sort of chicago's always had a robust a civilization community both in the government transparency and with the government innovation so being involved in that space and being sort of in the trenches of government sort of open my eyes to sort of the gap in what we could have and what was totally at use so once i started controlling from Sparta calvo

and doing research and writing on some of these issues and how we can manage some Civic app projects i just store said okay this is what i want to do this is how I can sort of translate my government experience in life public administration education so that inside with the technology stuff right and I scratch over the over the last two years is there any project and you're like

like wild is really you can feel that like it made a difference in and put something you're really proud of is there anything that stands on your mind probably my favorite Civic app so far it's sort of hard to pick your favorite but one of the ones I think I tend to favor working apps the apps that don't just display information on a map but serve some purpose in facilitating the

interaction between residents and their government probably my favorite one right now is app called to bone Chicago okay so if I'm eating in a restaurant and food born to do ok so I'm eating in a restaurant you know afterwards I kind of feel funny and kind of sort of sick if I tweet out you know eight a poison cafe now I'll feel some good yeah the food one app will actually catch my app

or attempts to catch my tweet flag the health department the Health Department tweets me back saying hey I'm sorry I could you give us a little more information help us out I go online I fill out this web for it then goes into a 311 city service request that gets routed to the health department they will send food inspectors to that restaurant to make sure that that

restaurant is doing everything that it's supposed to be doing and not getting other people so instead of some long or I mean thing I think about times where I've just treated something but I would never have called the food department you know sad right then like a this this is a sketchy place yeah so the way it works is if you get food poisoning you're supposed to call 311 right but

most people aren't aware of doing are aware of that or not even aware that you know you can do you have a 311 and so they didn't know that actually it'll just now have yeah so they built the app as sort of an outreach just so that the health department kind of expands its sort of outreach and talking to people who helps engage it helps and it takes that the service to where the people are

and we're on twitter and on facebook and the exciting part is you know they were able to do this for like pennies in it I to redeploy this toilet city they have to have three along they have to have a health department that's willing to sort of work with that program yeah and it's like five bucks a month really because the computing power that they use things two things like it was in web

services and some smart programming on their part they've been able to make it a very low cost way of doing so I kinda takes out that whole cost we go it's going to cost a thousand dollars now it's gonna cost a shoebox and they're going to be able to reach people and find out more about what's going on in your community absolutely great um any other you describe your work with a few

different organizations that the smart Chicago collaborative and the ones we've talked about with the optin government of any other organization that people might want to check out here in Chicago or Eva if they are not in Chicago that they may be should even if they're not interested in development maybe should just become aware of yeah well the other thing is going on this summer is the

data science or social good there are data science for social good yes d SSG a dot IO I think they defiance for social good was actually easier there the dsg is a fellowship that lasts just over the summer they fill teams to data science this ran postdoc students they form teams to help solve a civic problem using data science okay they've got a number of interesting projects next year

they're going to start posting on their blog about some of those issues and some of the solutions that are coming up with so that would be exciting to watch in the next couple weeks to see what they come up with okay great well thank you very much for taking the past week I get it user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in

usergroups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you casa com hi it's mike with you cash again slow guard the web visions 2014 in Chicago Gene Siskel Film Center cinema Brad Smith who actually created the web

patients conference back important like that about what he said 14 years ago yeah in 2001 2001 so thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me in so 14 years it's what what can you remember back there to the pre-ops feel 90s what led to the creation of what visions well we actually had running a user group called the dev group Northwest in Portland that we move from

New York City to Portland back in 94 and there was not a lot of user groups that we're really talking about interactive or web and so I decided to start one because i would like to kind of wanted to build the community there and we grew it out to about 1,200 members and at one point we just said you know let's do a show or an event you know to bring people together because we also wanted

to do is we wanted to bring people together from this of different disciplines and while we weren't tech we weren't like super tech-focused we can kind of a little bit more on the technical side of things versus the design side of things so we wanted designers and strategists and media people to kind of come together and and so we did it a a one-night event with

Jeffrey Zeldin I'm talking about web standards and hues and we and we applied it not just from the technical side of web standards but really where's the web going oh no and and if you have a foundation where we can establish standards work how can we do you know browsers and the web do you know bigger things and the panel afterwards talked about photography talked about media

talked about journalism you know bringing in different ideas different disciplines exactly okay this these people are thinking about things in their own industries yeah we're so new what can we think about it what we learn yeah and the beach and the truly at that point you know the web was you know still very new at that I mean the interactive web especially and

we we actually had to get an internet connection we have your mind about 50 via phone come on from the office right up and we had thought we had actually dial-up connection to the internet for web visions 2001 and it was just say your web enabled account before anybody else could say that but barely you know dial-up you know we had a 56k modem and so it was like really hilarious now you

think about it you know we're like let's bring up this website and you know wait and wait and wait but but we really we thought this really was really great than that exactly we wanted to do we wanted to bring people together and we had about a hundred and thirty-five hundred and forty people for that first event and so we said well let's let's do another one and see what it's like and

so the next year we did a full day event and we had think around five speakers but one of them was Jesse James Gareth from a deaf town and he talked about where you see the future where to find the future and so here that was when the kind of the big kind of haha pain that is part of the vision side of my visions it's you know there's a quote about the you know the futures all around us is

just unevenly distributed right and so we wanted to try to look at those trends and those new technologies new practices that would help drive you know people's own practices further along you know I'm to really you know embrace where the future of what was going to try to build towards it and plan for it and so you know we did that and we kept going we moved to the convention center the next

year and it became a you know two day event and then it became a three day event and then you know then we had a bunch of other events around it and so became almost like a week-long series of events plus the show but they're having a thought because you say that I became this again that what was it that you not like said oh wow this this last year we did a half a show what what made you

I knew two dates well you know it's funny we just decided one the year the time they decided to do two days we we wanted to do workshops and it's okay because people said we need something more intensive you know an hour 45 minutes is not enough in some cases to really get into a subject and so we decided to do some half day workshops and full day workshops and so we did

that and so became a two-day event and the learning from that was that really it's not much harder to do two days or three days just to do one day and a lot of planning goes into a regardless of how many days to do it and so really got to be a point where you know we found that a day of workshops plus two days of sessions and you can keynote two panels was really nice I mean it gave people

enough time so they weren't taking a whole lot of time off work but they could come to Portland because we've only important event one come from the conference and stay for the weekend and do something fun that door stuff because as people wanted to do so so by doing that we were able to actually also draw from outside of the community and so it became less of like a city you know or

regional event and more of an event that had come in that drawing national and international so is that one who started to say okay how can we take this on the road yeah people would then would say you know while you're not now you're doing this show for like you know three days and it's great but you know it's hard for me to travel from New York you know or points you know East to get to

the Portland show pretty much everything yeah pretty much yeah so I mean our second largest city for as far as draw for Portland of San Francisco we have tons of people come up from so I'm just going so really you know that shows great at drawing anybody up and down the west coast so we decided to experiment we didn't show in Atlanta we we did this road atlanta knowing that we really

didn't want a new shows elsewhere we planned on that so we did a show mine on the fall and we were going to we already have show planned for new york following up on that so it wasn't like this was the test and to see if we could do it or not it was just a test of like what do we need to prepare for and so the Atlanta show was great it was a november three years ago and and we

learned a lot from that we figured out kind of how to do a road show by doing that one show and then she did New York and we did Portland began and then we did Barcelona Spain and that was our first international show we thought oh you know how this is going to be a real test to see how how hard it is and you know it's just it by doing taking the shows on the road just kind of you

figure out how to actually stand off the rustic rough edges you know you get it so that it's easier easier to do and the things you think you know if we cut this you change that it makes it easier and take some it's less of a toll on the staff to do it because we're largely a volunteer-run organization so we we have to kind of rely on the kindness of strangers that and friends that are

everywhere to really kind of help with the show on so if we can make it easier and require less work for the people who have to help put it on then it makes it easier to do it is going to different places when you're looking at what different cities what are what are some of your value how do you evaluate the candidates sitting in my position or whether or not to go there well if we

have people in the city who are interested in bringing show that is extremely helpful I've already having Tamia and for Porter Chicago we had people in Chicago up and said you know let's bring Chicago if you guys are going to help us out a little bit that'd be great and most of time to help really has to be just you know can you provide us connections to people will you do the

introductions will you do a little bit of you know you know recon for us on some spaces maybe your values and you know it's a lot but it just it but it's that helpful first step for Barcelona it's a little different animal because it's you know it's a European show we you know it's you have a lot more cultural issues for like just coming into a location and doing a show so we

have a board member that's located in Barcelona she is you know dedicating enough time to it and she you know shares and some of her you know revenues if there are remedies for it and she's you know been really great great part of her my name is Mariana and so it really kind of Mary's you know we're looking at maybe doing a show in it some other cities and so I'm

going to be going to those cities this fall and to check out yeah to see you know how how practical or feasible would be to do that but you know it's it's really if it could do you know a show and you know simple America or South America maybe do a show in Asia well that would be great you know you talk about actually does it show up some venues in Africa as well for doing the

show but I you know the next step i think is you know how do we scale it you know beyond that and knowing we have a kind of dedicated staff of them wanted to pay it and it's not me and some other people that are doing it how can we put how can we scale it and make it work and still you know do the other things we need to do so this tender side project which is really interesting and bringing

cool it's at the primary not the primary business you know so this is surprising if your food not the first person who runs a conference who doesn't have there's a comfort wellbut i should say they do conference it goes all around the world but it's still not their main focus yes it's part of the business yeah now listen you when you look at these events if thinking oh my gosh seems it

doesn't have to work yeah we're off the clock pons and some of them do but yeah there's like deconstruct for is a good example on other people and they don't think of that you know because they want to try to be happy case you know it's a it's their primary business for sure so so I think that those kind of models where you have communities we need is like minded people people will help out

or I mean you can do it I think the next the future though for conferences is really intense is really quite trying to extend them so that they have more of a connection throughout the year to a location and we don't have really all the answers there yet we're working towards that but are you familiar with the go to clubs people no I'm not oh they do something where did you go to

thanks times a year I go to a city and I say we get up to the big event they just look at first one I'm not sure how to interview go to come but they do these small events I got food speaker I could use a good put a featured speaker you might come during the course of a couple month or so order and just kind of build a buzz invite people to the tune so that way it never really goes cold yeah

remember we go Cole lon yeah that's a great idea that's that's kind of what we're doing what we're trying to do more anymore it's just a you know that I'm sure that their model would probably relies upon people continuing that right and not just said people who are founding it to be at every single lines event yeah they were like a little different yeah locations with different

people have small offices in different cities and then answered extra time even hot you might think the charger an argument affect you with that nice yeah well thank you very much for taking the time to Saddam okay thank you very much for doing this upper cheat you come to the show and talking to people here that's very love to do it user groups with lots to say interviews and more no

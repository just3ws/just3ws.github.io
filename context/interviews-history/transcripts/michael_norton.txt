hi I'm Mike I'm sitting down here with Michael Norton who is involved in helping to run and lead the was of the clamor the Cleveland agile are extremely the Cleveland Ruby Brigade the Cleveland adagio natural group and the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Pittsburgh magical okay so that's a that's a mouthful so can you tell us a little bit about you know you're doing three groups that's right

that's a lot so yeah well it's not it's not it's not that difficult when you've got good helping we've got groups you know the way we kind of run them on occasion we will have a meeting that is basically a idea generation okay so kind of like you're doing open space yeah like a kickoff meeting yeah exactly so so Pittsburgh agile group is the most recent one that we started and kind of

how we started that is a good model it's the same pattern we use to keep them running so we'll have at the venue if it's in Cleveland it's on our boat in Pittsburgh it's usually a venue of one of the members right and web a party so there's there's food there's drinks whatever and we'll actually have a few laptops that are set up and will kick off a discussion about you know what is

this group about what do we want to talk about what's of interest in november's and then as people come up with ideas of things that they either want to present what would like to have your resented they go ahead and keep we use meet up okay and the key idea in to meet up and then folks can kind of hope those up both those down by saying interested in attending and then in for Pittsburgh a

jewel we have a couple of folks from matrix solutions this annoying thing that helped to actually achieve to help to run the script this point they really run the group right but they'll kind of look at the topics and then maybe reach out to the folks at say hey do you want to present on this or do I want presented and we usually try and get the schedule out two or three months in

advance people know what's coming up okay and then it's a matter of just kind of watching that back Loggins it starts to diminish if you're not hearing new ideas and throw your idea party so okay so you do these kind of these idea parties us your kind of airing of normal say you're regularly but whenever they're needed yeah like it's like all of our we're

going to learn you make on our kind of our backlog of topics so let's have another idea and just because that's like I'm a new concept to me I heard anybody else doing anything like that before we just get some people that are just from the group okay yeah it's basically it's actually a group meeting okay so it's kind of it was it's as if we were going to do an open space oh but

we don't actually cover any of these topics we just talked about yeah what do we want to talk about record that and agree that handled amazing and you do so you're usually able to have the people that are attending run than we do so if you're not always brilliant external speakers now but often often times its members of the group themselves that are actually speaking on occasion we do

bring in those terms Cleveland Ruby brigade is one where you know maybe a member says oh wow I'm really interesting and interested in I no sequel victories right right and we got the opportunity to have John new maker come in well yeah so yeah so we brought him in but oftentimes it's the members themselves that are that are giving a presentation ass okay we do have again

for Cleveland reproduce specifically i just recently made that nonprofit okay so you actually have some fun we can we now have said what the charitable Desai camera what the status is not good but but it allowed us to to raise some funds and so we can actually use that to bring in speakers we can also use that to to pay for meals or refreshments and events so now what happens is sponsors it used

to be that us that we if every meeting you try to expand Sur lined up to pay for that meetings Neal okay and sometimes that coordination was very difficult yeah we can say hey if you want to sponsor just you know let us know throw a few bucks then exactly we'll put that into integrated into the coffers and then we'll take care of the all the rest of logistics okay and most

of the time sponsors are are are finally the Asian one will say hey I want to make sure that you know make sure you mention our name I'm glad to do that yeah so with the with the three mins you ever when you do these um the cydia parties is it just you have the people form from the Ruby Brigade at the Ruby we're a no great idea and a job either solar they're really they truly are

three separate groups they just that they're using using the same management techniques yet help with them so your role isn't so much actively running the group you kind of like a consult yes yeah I mean I it's really it's especially you know when we started taking out additional groups having that when it was just cool of Cleveland Ruger became I had a much more hands-on

involvement in we decided to start the cleveland had to a group I quickly realized that that approach wasn't going to work for me it was taking too much time and it wasn't it was taking too much of my time I wasn't doing the job well enough right I didn't feel like I was servicing the group so we had to figure out a way that we could get kind of the groom to take ownership of their

own you know the money of their own events and how many looking sports oh yeah it's really you know the group decides what they want to talk about it i'm just kind of their monitoring and watching yeah sure that you know the backlog gets low let's throw another party i usually kick off the meetings or for another one that you know the folks that's helping kicks off the meeting

reminds folks a post ideas up on the site right mentions who our sponsors are so you you you really and I mean dog helped to cultivate the new groups get them pass those some of those initial stages and I'll make sure that they continue on in it in a way that's going to be positive and not just fall over it and just the other this is interest yeah

it's interesting and have you I forgot the three groups I heard that there was other other groups as well that are that are kind of knew that are sprouting up autumn dance groups or out of these not yet we have talked about actually targeting some other sydney's interestingly enough we have a customer movement now who and I wish could say who they are but I cancel the debt they

wanted to start a natural group right to kind of promote this within their own organization and so we actually consulted with them on yeah here's how you can do it here's how you can run it your side you know here's kind of sorts of ways that you can get you know the community involved and I believe they just launched their own internal agile group and I father actually following a

very similar patterns and I'm sure they'll find your own way that's interesting how I a user group could be formed inside of a single corporation initially it's an entirely separate entity from from corporately they had they had some agreed we actually talked about it being a public a public group they had something turns if they wanted to be able to share very specifically

amongst all of their difference teams yeah some really proprietary general information okay but they but prior attempts to do something like this I don't wanna say in tennis was mandatory but the way I was put together people felt like more than they were obliged to go and so the quality wasn't where they wanted that was the question I was going to ask is if it was a internal user

group it's more like it's a training and they could get become compulsory nuts right on right now that conservation yeah movies were to really try encourage them to to run it as as the chimerical the hook that and imprint it is that you know the folks who are going to show up because they want to be there and bring a lot of quality and you're going to get

a really good result as opposed to make everyone be there you know you're not going to get the same kind of quality and if the quality is there those who are on the fence will start to attack yeah and it's it's also interesting it wouldn't be compulsory but if I'm if I'm looking at a I'm an employee at a company i'm seeing that like I work for groupon if I see certain people and that

in my company go off in participating that you go fire I might maybe I'm not somebody would normally go to user group but because they're going I'm more likely to grade so that could also be a gateway drug to other that's like these are groups is like no I've started going to this to user group that was fun let's venture into the wild right you know right its racing at its yet to have

three groups and you know having them run simultaneous it sounds like it's a quite the challenge but it's also something you know fascinating to be able to look at three different communities that might not that are in completely different areas right like conceptually ruby in the agile both in Cleveland but covering very different topics and my Pittsburgh group which you

know might be the same Ruby topic but a very difficuit weenies three have you seen a great deal of difference in style or approach for the attendees of those groups yeah actually it's funny that you mentioned that on so the the Pittsburgh as a group kind of almost by accident one of the talks ended up being a very interactive discussion no Angie that can that grew wiped that so that style so

much that they've been pushing for that from oh c'mon where is the Cleveland group we do that on occasion but they also have a palette for you know someone who just stands in deliveries okay Pittsburgh agile group seems you know they want their sessions to be highly interact so same sometimes the same topic delivered a completely different fashion between the two rapes

it sounds almost like raising children and they're going to have their own case in their own yeah we're fuzzy hats and right head and Celine dog hat and and government but you know ultimately trying to fulfill the same goal of having a community that they can be a part of well thank you very much my absolutely and really appreciate sitting down to talk with you

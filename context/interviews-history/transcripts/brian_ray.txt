hi I'm like I'm sitting here with Brian break from the chippy the Chicago Python users group and hi Brian things are for sitting down the clock we're about to go into a meeting but thought we'd sit down and talk about the meeting before our about the group beforehand so sir Brian can you tell me a little bit of a little bit chippy and Chicago Python community well in since 2003 I call myself a

founding member along with in decaying and Chris McAvoy a group of others that showed up a gruesome goose island literally could fit around this table talking about a language at the time that wasn't as popular as it is now called a Python which is a just become a very bad for the language in recent years yeah Google's really embraced it Google is embraced it you know a lot of

other other companies and businesses from the bracelet cited came at the time when we started meeting we one of our largest draws from the scientific community in fact so a lot of scientists from the universities here and even professors doing research with children our meetings isn't quite on one of the few languages that's interstellar anyway I thought one of the rover's had some

scripting in quite climb it does in fact one of our very active members David Weasley who also teaches a class a specialized class here in Chicago and also presents it should be quite frequently did go down of NASA and taught Python to a lot of the engineers there recently that's going to be exactly then he sees quite a smart guy in fact we record a lot of our meetings

and the one meeting he spoke about the gill which is a an element of Python an internal had forty one thousand downloads or something like that in a short period of time so you know you know should be does a lot more than just have a monthly we do have yeah obviously yeah I was to say uh you know as we kind of were talking before the interview I had

noticed meeting as I could looks like they had gone back to two thousand four but really said 2003 and recommend I mean that was the first recording meaning yeah right so the early meetings you know consisted of us meeting up and various locations clean like knock-knock building famous building at Chicago and we kind of got into the trend of moving our meetings around a lot and that's

worked well with in Chicago because there's a lot of different places and he was quite them for very different things you know so we are meeting in a university would be totally acceptable and Chicago Tribune them out like last year alone we've met at Riccardo intolerance for me that drew over hundred fifty people we met a morning star which had a good draw last year and

you know even that Google's Chicago office we've had had some very successful meetings as last year is it his now most places when they move to different locations can be kind of hard to track people but I mean it sounds like you have a following that's going to go on wherever you're at yeah we're the Grateful Dead abuser crew that's for sure yeah we've got a lot of following

the people that can't make it because it's in one location generally we want to be somewhere we can get to to it the public transportation as well as traditional transportation but be centralized as possible and accessible another big challenge now is finding a space big enough to fit 7850 people for some some meetings yeah that's and it's it's funny because I until I joined

groupon and Ken stocks and sent out the stocks right yes I've had some out the DI the blast to the internal def mailing list they need to know there was a why i should say that's not correct i knew of the cooper while ago how then mentioned it a few years foreign country code camp but I didn't realize was selective you have your own website and you kind of manager group outside of

the popular mainstream meet up and effect varieties right right so we reject the level of ideas early on and I think that was really out of resistance of becoming the shiny new thing because a lot of times the shiny new thing we found we're watching other groups just think they're gone before you go in it's that's really good a point of resilience for us is to not be in shiny things

right and despite all of our efforts to be unsuccessful and here we are and I we are so you know what sounds like you have a little bit of success when they may be plus people 50 50 some odd for this meeting sure yeah we do and you notice a lot of new members that are coming this time probably because it's a groupon for for instance but there's also a lot of well seasoned members

there's a lot of professors and scientists coming as well as very well-known web developers and mobile developers as well i did not realize that there was such a vibrant Python community here in Chicago answers that's because I mean the Ruby is very good at being shiny anything so I just wonder how much do you have do you feel any competition or is your cross pollination

with the key of two dynamic languages to scripting languages they're both kind of answering the same domain of problems or this from my perspective do you much cross-pollination with groups yes so if you know very early on Ruby days we were already had established Minh and there was a lot of crewmen from your community coming into our tour music group but I don't know if the same is true the

opposite direction certainly that was true you know we had snakes and Ruby's at one time conference where we put ghh the writer who had rails who came to Chicago 37signals and we had a dream a party who came was a Chicago guy as well and wrote Django and Python and from two different worlds we put them in front are at DePaul University and expects a couple people to show up to see them and

we filled the entire place for 120 people yeah I think I heard about that that was kind of big criminal favor I didn't realize have a Chicago yeah it was kind of a famous thing and but it was actually sponsored by should be a nun was and as a lot of other events like I said we have mentorship program you know we have other events like we set three guys to hike on this year a

couple weeks ago that was great completely out of Jimmy funds all of our meetings are completely free they're always there's always food and drink there well if we're 40 how did you get to punch through sponsorships so yeah so we get sponsorships from various organizations and lately one thing we've been doing is doing some of our doing some recruiting connections so some of

the organizations are looking for high notch you know developers that come to us and we'll say okay shirt or we can we can find one of you if we don't find one easy way to do a lot of work it would be nice if you don't need a couple of dollars toward our user group so we can buy beer for the meeting that makes sense it's a good way it's like a little quid pro quo ok we'll do something for

you something for us communities all the matter forts and it's got a job threat and the community is able to find itself it's a very interesting kind of grassroots way of finding funding also it's not just shown for for for donations it's very hard left it down because I get it I'm at a loss for words but I think wow then again they get something other than we get Sophia exact

so it works really quite nicely ok and so what is the typical schedule so should be meetings are on the second always on the second thursday of the month at 7pm some and you relate to go to chippy org and join the mailing list effect right now we're chose me because we move around so it's ch I py dot org that's right CH i py door and you know we post the meetings there when we know

information we have an announcement list if you only want to get announcements and I general mainland where I'm discussion okay well thank you very much for extra Johnson nice Istanbul enforce to be great thank you

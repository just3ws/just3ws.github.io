hi I'm sitting here with audra chef Minh from the Houston Dobie users group and it's going to tell us the world with a bottle but they do down in Texas with Adobe so what can you tell us a little bit a bunch of roofing sure it's the Houston double users group we have the whole range of Adobe products but which includes photoshop illustrator flash and flex since I run the group but I'm

mostly a flash reflects developer at target mostly mostly and unless some unless some someone goes up and said I really want a photo shop right a presentation or something they don't find this key with them ok that the most part it's a flash flex the name sedum she meet monthly Houston monthly usually works out to about eight times a year ok well we try for every month with us

always happen especially now what the holiday is coming on ok and in as far as like what's your typical attendant stuff like he is you should get dabs or designers I mean if you do in the Flex group would be probably more biased towards and as for devs um we the route varies a lot between like three people who come or 80 people come depending on the speaker or whatever the designer

stuff is usually a little bit more people they're just harder to find speakers for some time I mean the flex dev community but yeah just ranges everyone shows up and we try to tailor it to like beginner level content ok an odd I even just something about a kind of a technical detail of the group is is how do you manage your meetings you do I I saw the website but i think i'm free

capture was meet up or it's well it's adobe solution to managing all of its groups ok so adobe provides groups a group w com site for us ok so if you want a formula double user group just go there and say I'm whatever on the group and here's the meeting times in and they can they can push anybody who's interested to that site so you can search for other user groups are areas

that only the adobe oriented groups or ok ok and I'm you know like what what made you want to find a group you know but or or did you follow the group or you taking it over I've taken it over for chaos but I work alone I'm a independent contractor okay and I mean coming to conferences like this and reaching out to my community it's the way they're actually people

yeah but otherwise just working on an island talk to anybody right but yeah that's what drove me to create my first user group as well ah great so when you're when you're having a meeting I mean you describe the juban from hitting a three person meeting to an 80 personally what kept you going through those down times of having a ball attendance and that you know because

that's that's something that can really it is very draining it's almost defeatism yeah hello is just the you know for the help people come out and they're interested I'm excited to give them something right you know that's that's kind of what it is I enjoy the opportunity to meet with people I think there's a lot of value in facetime right I mean in our energy especially today

everyone's on social networks or talking over computer that's that's not a connection right that's your that's an interface right it'sit's and I think the human connection just meeting some money and whatever it is that you're talking about having having face time with people just a diagram right in you know and then you know we talked about the three meeting the three-person meeting

but but any of the other end in structure when you're you're in overflow capacity you know we are 80 people i mean that's that's got to be well the other end of this part the a people is very predictable right as if you know adobe is touring and they send you known evangelists thomas or something weird like you know hey i don't be here there's a big name here and you know all

I never had surprised topics like I did not know this is hip hop it yeah a surprise topic will be like 15 to 20 people okay okay great in a you know what what advice would you give to somebody that's an abusive like I I'm familiar with the Chicago theory but what is what's unique about user groups in used to it's all I'm not I look at

Harvard rafi yeah I don't know if I can give you advice because I don't know if I'm seating because no I'm happy when I have three people well that's its you have to reveal all right I had review but I found that with Houston if the meeting is not in the building that you work in yeah or exactly on your route home I'm not going to come right you know if it's like five minutes either

way he's donating stones don't get there for the most part that's why we have our study three people also you have a lot of committed members that will come back right right unless it's an amazing topic or something that someone's it's time to know or someone just comes into the area like I need a new job or I need to hone my skills in this area but no but if we if we move our location we're like oh

we're going to have this downtown at this building people who work in that building will show up oh ok ok now if we go to the the most convenient option for us as the managers which has the parking free entrance the you know the wife 3y plus all my stuff then we get all three people if we go downtown will you have to pay for parking and Simon to security and more time you get more attendance

but it's a higher yes it's a higher barrier to entry that someone who's not downtown or not actually in that building welcome and his you know looking at some things like cost like if you were to go down to his does it only hit offer any kind of support or anything i did for helping its you think they do at certain like membership levels ok which were nowhere near so if

we had like consistently had like over 100 members we would get some level support could consist they have like 400 members coming we get another level support they offer incentives they don't give a software to wrap away at other swag yeah which is awesome and you know the day that we say today's the the raffle for the thousand-dollar software people show off yeah we can only did was

here yes but we're like that once a year so you know we try to build incentives look more times you come the more raffle ticket you can get oh ok things like that it goes all just a big bribes well sometimes you gotta do what you got to do well anyway it was really great talking to you here it's a houston adobe user screw yes and they meets

semi-monthly every month with some breaks okay but you can find out what we link into their user group Bob our Druce user group in the in the post thank you very much sure thank you

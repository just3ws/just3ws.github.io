hi it's Mike refugee tastic i'm here with Chad Fowler well i'm actually not here but sitting down with Chad Fowler and I you might know him know him for from his books passionate programmer and he's been a long time participant and leader in the Ruby community thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me Chad thank you Mike it's 2 a.m. your time so you deserve more

things than I do well you know what I wanted to jump in is uh you've been in the Ruby community a long time can you tell a little bit about how you got involved in Ruby and I mean when you got involved was it was it already serving at popular or yeah it's interesting that you you say got involved in Ruby since ruby is a tool but it's actually appropriate to UM so I used to learn a

different programming language basically every weekend just a cursory thing and one weekend I was I was finally deciding that I was going to switch to small talk I was going to be my thing and my last playground weekend before i switched to just learning fault small talk full time i found Ruby because Dave Thomas from the pragmatic programmers posted something on the XP mailing list i think

and i downloaded it and within a day i had learned enough that i was able to rewrite and deploy my blog software and I was kind of hooked after that so like what what era was that it was like early development sir it was in the year 2000 yeah and and you asked if ruby was already popular than it wasn't it was really friendly no one knew what it was no one I worked with for example had

ever heard of it even now you said get involved with which is kind of interesting because I think probably I wouldn't have necessarily stuck around with Ruby as long as I did unless I actually got involved like kind of literally with Ruby and its world because back then like you you could probably know everyone who spoke English and used Ruby right because there's a

small group of us it was a little bigger in Japan not that much bigger though so yeah I got involved in the community on the IRC channel Ruby laying on freenode or whatever it used to be called back then and then ultimately in less than a year after starting with Ruby I ended up getting evinced by a promise to help organize the first international ruby conference in tampa

florida oh wow so you what kind of went from getting involved in learning this new language to running a conference in about a year yeah less than a year i think what was it was probably six months after starting then that I sort of joined the organizing committee the organizing committee was primarily me David black and Dave Thomas we had a guy who had started it and for personal

reasons he had to to stop being involved with it and focus on his business so we took it over Dave Thomas kind of led us into doing it and then let me and David mostly run with it David black which we did for many years afterward so was that your first conference I mean you went from learning a language to your first conference or had you been involved with other conferences prior to that yeah I

think that was the first conference I ever attended actually I'd wanted to go to a bunch of him for years but never had a chance and I think for like five years after that I still had never attended a conference that I wasn't organizing somehow oh wow that's you gotta jump right into the to the deep end of organic of conferences you didn't skip the whole attending park just went

straight to you creating your own uh did that song or i should say was that what vice she became rubyconf and railsconf as we know now or was that before Ruby conf uh that was Ruby calm so that was really calm yeah in fact we called it Ruby come back then yeah from the very beginning probably I wouldn't have called it that I would have called it rubicon or when

the thing that rolls off the tongue better is Bucky Hurst who had initially started the project abri become called it that and therefore we also called railsconf rails comp when we started it just so it would be equally difficult to pronounce I guess yeah and you said I jumped into the deep end but not really I mean it was it was sort of deep because it was in another city

international but the first crew become Foley had 34 people and I think it's been a long time since I've even attended a user group meeting as as few people as the first rubyconf dead oh wow I so when you say 30 people you mean total attendees yeah including the speakers wow that's that's a very modest beginning and we did feel a little bit disheartening at first or was it just

fun because you're like hey there's people here this is cool now it wasn't this hurting at all we thought it was amazing you know and the I mean it was amazing to us because it was such a fringy thing people weren't really using it Ruby had taken off sort of I shouldn't even say taken off Ruby had gained the infatuation of many people in the early arrival / extreme programming

community so a lot of people from that world were there including several of the signatories of the agile manifesto which happened like between the time that we started planning Ruby Kaufman actually did rubyconf is when they got together and did the agile manifesto and we had mats obviously creator of Ruby we had people who were language and vm designers it was it was a good kind of

fringy you know everyone wasn't there was definitely way more experienced and more intelligent than I was at that time and and I thought it was it was the perfect kind of mix of people yeah it sounds like it's it's it's gone from a kind of an experimental audience to now we're seeing here 14 years later it's it's used in everyday programming uh yeah but to look back and that was it

was it was your first conference that you attended also as a speaker or was that also your first time speaking at a ruby conf or had you spoken anywhere before in fact I wasn't really speaking I did some of the announcements and stuff yet I didn't I didn't take one of the speaker's lots they've actually tried to get me to do one and I said okay provisionally and

then bailed out because it's too too stressful trying to help organize and speak at my first conference I think I only spoke at one Ruby comp um when it comes to the official Ruby comp right and that was in 2005 and San Diego Jim lyric and I did a three hour tutorial on continuations in Ruby and it was such a poorly organized event and I say that as the person you know half responsible for

organizing it we the tutorials took place there were two and they took place in the same room so we kind of had to divide on opposite sides of the r agreement right not to interfere we go but the other tutorial going on was David hi de Meyer Henson talking about new features in rails one point oh I think so once again even though Ruby comp list who had 100 people Jim I had a

tiny little that felt like the original repella well they behind my hands and addressed most of the rubyconf attendees now that was the only only speaking I ever did at rubyconf actually me and Jim doing in continuations tutorial for three hours well that's that's kind of funny did to end well later on when did you eventually start to get into you being a you know you were like you were

a keynote or if I recall at the scn a 2010 so you've obviously had a lot of a lot of my experience between two thousand and two thousand ten you know when did you really start to get into the swing of of speaking at other local conferences or going on to larger national conferences or international conferences um i guess it was after i mostly after i wrote my first book so

in 2003 and 2004 I proposed a couple of talks to Oz con 2003 we had this it was me and David black who was the co-organizer rubyconf we had this really great idea of a talk that was going to be like speak Ruby like a native or something colloquial Ruby that's what it was which I thought was just it was such a good abstract is going to be such a good talk they didn't want it and we

didn't get accepted and then the next year I proposed something on Rue blog which was Dave Thomas's kind of interesting simple blog software and that got accepted for some reason I think that was pretty terrible talk but I ended up doing it but so I think that was the only one I ever proposed and did in that way but then in 2005 I was I wrote the book my job went to India and

all I got was this lousy book and I got my first invitation to speak because of that book and I was so surprised that I actually thought the people inviting me made a mistake but they were eating they're inviting Martin Fowler oh I actually emailed them and ask them are you sure i would love to do it but are you sure you didn't mean Martin Fowler because I didn't want to get there and

have them be just me know so I thought that had to be kind of I exciting a little little thrilling I would you a call what she ended up talking about it that our conference oh yeah first keynote appearance would be hard to forget I did a talk it was at was at the Cusack conference in Montreal which is an excellent conference I think it's still going on it's Canadian university

software engineering conference they've had so many great speakers over the years and it was a talk called fight the traffic which is a a phrase I borrowed from a cab driver in DC about one's approach toward work and it was really it was based on my book my job went to India which ended up being the passionate programmer in a second edition so it was a book about building

a remarkable career kind of telling my story right and so you know when you were so you're doing these you're writing these books you're starting to speak it more and more larger conferences it's been a few years now that at that in this timeline that Ruby conf and rails comfort are growing and eventually you transfer those over and hand off the the role of ownership

over to our stewardship over to having the Phoenix how did how did that go about how did that come to 20 be well organizing these conferences is really stressful um still as today I'm sure it's even worse now but it when you do them even though it's a labor of love maybe even more so because it's a labor of love you end up with these painful situations where every single thing you

do is scrutinized in Krita nine career criticized I recognized as interesting could have just said one word criticized by some sub group in the community they work community kind of loosely there and I think that's just human nature you know you do something that people think is important and people will viciously attack the things they don't agree with now I knew that and I dealt with that

for years and I was fine with it but it's tiring so i will say that it's worth it but it's tiring so in 2005 when we were organizing the san diego rubyconf which was the fifth one I said okay I'm done with conference organization just going to do this one I'll even speak at it I'll be done I'll tend them but I don't have time and it just takes too much out of me and I went

to the conference and we had grown from 64 to 200 people that year because of rails completely because of rounds we were absolutely surprised we sold out in just a couple hours it's crazy and when I got there I thought this is really two conferences there needs to be something separate about rails so that we can really focus on rails there and try to maintain the kind of weird Ruby comp

thing Ruby come and I talked to David Hanson about it I talked to David Allen black and rich comer co-organizers at that time and everyone said I think you're right but we won't do it so as long as you do it it's okay have railsconf so that's what happened I stayed involved and I started rails confident not following here as the main organizer of

it under Ruby Central which kind of roped me in for a few more years but the truth is like so I basically did five more years but this time it was now Ruby comp rails comp and sometimes railsconf Europe as soon as I finally found people who were willing and passionate and able which is Evan Phoenix been Scofield for a while and Marty thought I very like readily pulled them in and and gave up

organization of the conference so that's how that happened and these days sadly I haven't even attended last couple of years sort of a pain being in Europe but honest truth is I'm not really excited by Ruby anymore I like it but I don't need to go to a conference about it anymore I think of other than seeing all my friends and the people who I respect that are still contributing it's not my

area of passion so maybe it's not worth the cost of time and money to get to him well after having worked in in a community in a language for nearly 15 years I'm sure it's kind of like okay we've been there done that let's let's do something new you do something fun exactly so are you also looking at other languages like I know Dave Thomas is pushing elixir is that something a new

community you're looking at or are you just kind of happy using Ruby like you're like you are now now actually at work now I work on wonderless and we have a bunch of micro services in the back end one blast Plus native clients on every platform so on the I spend time in client platforms which means Java objective c c sharp etc javascript but on our back end we're

using a lot of scala closure Ruby go we even just deployed a haskell service a couple of weeks ago I'm really kind of I made this decision that at least for now I'm not going to involve myself in a language community and the reason for that is although it was very rewarding for me I think getting involved with Ruby as you started this this podcast using that phrase it tied me too closely

to ruben and i'm not going to say that my career has suffered because of it but for i don't know seven or eight years I've been explicitly saying out loud to my friends and colleagues I feel like I'm stuck in Ruby and I can't manage to get out to the next thing and I don't want to have this this closed point of view this for my act is a perspective on how to develop software but because I

was so heavily involved in the community it makes it even harder to pull yourself out and really fully dig into something else so I'm kind of doing this crazy experiment where I've probably programmed in 15 programming languages for work over the last month which really hurts my brain but it's it's fun and and I'm trying to treat the languages as tools and keep has brought

a perspective as possible as opposed to to developing this emotional tie to the tool that I use so I have you overall aside from just not wanting to be too bound to a specific language community have you been kind of keeping the whole Technical Community idea and of an arm's length now or or do you see another aspect of tech community that you're still identifying with out whether it's

I don't know if you're into the craftsmanship movement or anything like that um I guess I have my own community now which is something I'm lucky to be able to say you know I look at stuff like the craftsmanship movement that's a really good example I overlapped with them a lot because I have a lot of friends in it and I believe in a lot of the same

things that the craftsmanship people believe in I've spoken at two of the SC na conferences and recently just did this craft compn in hungry which is amazing by the way but I think movements like this they serve maybe two or three different audiences none of which I belong to for any of the movements and I'll explain one audience is the people who I've always said that you like I go

around the world and I've been consulting and I run into people at every company when I'm brought in who are like that one guy or that one woman in the company who gets it and is trying to do everything everything they can for everyone else in the company to get it whatever it is so they bring people in and try to convert to new technologies and new techniques craftsmanship style

stuff really what they want is just to work in a good environment so they're trying to change their own environment and usually they're struggling really hard people like that need a movement to be in because they don't have support for what they think of as good ideas and then the other people that need a movement that are sort of the audience the intended audience of a movement or

community like software craftsmanship are the people who don't get it because they've never heard of it so those are the people to which you must evangelize so that they get better and they do the right thing and they start you know creating ethically good code or whatever it is you're trying to get them to do or they stopped doing Java and they start doing a ruby they stopped doing Ruby and

they start doing elixir well I never that they try to grow instead of just being well it's not that they try to grow though not in the context of this movement in the context of a movement the movement tries to make them grow right that's that's the audience I'm talking about because you don't have a movement if no one's going to change right the idea is to create some sort of

revolution and then the last audience would be like the companies that must be convinced to allow their employees to do this stuff and they need some sort of commercial looking thing to hang the ideas on so I'm none of those people because I work in an environment that's great I have great programmers we do the sorts of things that I wish we would do in a company where people are making

amazing code and when we don't and when I say we do I mean someone doesn't could even be me sometimes we just talk to each other and explain and sometimes we just disagree that's okay I think the idea of these communities and movements it's kind of like this weird human tendency to create religions I'm not saying religions are just made up necessarily that wouldn't be the thing

we talked about on this podcast but it feels like when someone finds something they like it like they form into groups and they try to force everyone else to like it too yes it becomes Dogma actually data had a fun interview with Dan north and we talked about exactly that about how he proposed the ideas of BDD and then eventually it becomes well if you're not doing BDD then you're

doing software wrong in and I don't think even he says that well you know what else is if you say you're doing BDD you almost definitely or not I have observed it when I've been two teams that say they use BDD use BDD usually is what they say but the reason I say you're almost definitely not is because once you name one of these things whether it be software craftsmanship or

whatever the masses will adopt the name allow completely missing the point and miss applying the technique or technology or whatever it is even if its rails like in the early days of rails if you were doing rails you were probably doing something good these days you're probably not now doesn't mean rails as bad it means that it's now mass mark and people are going to mess it up the

way they mess up everything right right so BDD now it's just block oriented testing and most people do it after the fact but the spirit of BDD was to create a new name to pull people out of the the wrong name the wrong associations that people have with PDD stead of create a new name that the fewer people understood but I think it ended up then focused to discuss them so that there

was a subset of people who did essentially TD the way TDD was meant to be under a new moniker but eventually that one's going to get messed up to you so then you have to move on with the next one or you can just declare that P ed is dad and move on is David Hanson death yeah yeah that was also fun interview um it and it kind of also I think reflects some of what you were

describing about how long people had strongly identify with these ideas these concepts these techniques and they internalize them and I was kind of looking at the conversations that came out of David Hannum Eric Hanson's talk where it was extremely polarizing in a lot of the responses that were against him seemed to be you're talking about this thing that i do that i really like

i have somehow internalized into my professional identity yes exactly and so you've therefore hurt me because it criticized my identity and that's what I was trying to get away with for all these years or get away from sorry in the Ruby community then I didn't want that close tie because I think it leads to not necessarily bad decisions but a hindered decision making process and and

so these days I'm trying not to be passionate about the specific technologies I use but more about just learning and and using the right things for the job that I'm getting done what's it's like the title of your book it isn't too passionate rubyists such as the National programmer it's a person programming it's not coder it's not a craftsman it's

just programmer in speaking of books are you still in the business of writing books are you working on any books now or is that something that you're also looking at kind of moving away from well I said after the first one I would never write another book again your feet books now if I counted correctly mmm i probably am credited on eight books but I've actually written to full books and

then rewritten them so kind of before I'm working on a book now maybe so slowly that it will never see the light of day with nilanjan raychaudhuri of typesafe on the Play Framework so it's the languages Scala and some building web applications and services using play in just to kind of come towards closing depends on on where we go with this question is we talked about conferences

and books and in general movements but I want to ask questions about user groups as well did you you said that your first conference was Ruby conf that you've organized but did you go to any user groups or we involved in the user group bought community it all prior to Ruby calm for afterwards not prior because I lived in Louisville Kentucky at the time and I think the only user groups going

on we're like the Microsoft group where thing whatever that was it wasn't sitepoint back pain I share boy whatever it wasn't sure point yet I think but it was like that kind of thing you know playing some technology you buy and complaining about it and while you drink coffee after that I did but mostly because I traveled a lot and people would find out that I was coming to town

and asked if I would speak at their user group I spoke a lot in DC and the rest in area before I moved there for some reason I don't know why but these days in Berlin were actually starting a new group next week my co-workers at six Wunderkinder and I called strange group and the purpose of strange group is it's probably going to be pretty small but we're going to be

talking about fringe technologies and I think my personal desire is to create a group that resembles the early days of Ruby comp where it's just a bunch of explorers that are talking about stuff that maybe isn't fit for production so next week we're going to have a talk on objective small talk by its creator who works with us Marcel via and and that's a small talk implementation on the

objective-c runtime and then a talk from one one of the Idris language core team members on introduction to interests I've got even heard of that language oh you should look at it IDR is okay and it's kind of like Haskell but also has dependent pipes so it's very possible than most people listening the desk won't even know what that means but that's why you should look it up I'm

just smiling and nodding be googling as soon as we're done myself up well I since you're up in Berlin I also would like to give a shout-out for her because we're on a we're on AM radio shout out um no Butler said there's a community in I don't know if they're near Berlin but the software scammer sculpt software skimmer I don't know if I'm probably mangling their name but it's a it's a

user group community that's focused on the software craftsmanship and I've spoken with her throw organizer via Twitter many times and they have another conference coming up in August called Socrates it's a software craftsmanship something somehow they got sundries yourself across worship but it's it's it's a testing even opt for you did it is testing suffer craftsmanship intact

do they get that crap up yeah I'm really minecraft conf and in Budapest a couple weeks ago it looks like a really good conference I think it relax with some personal date that I had on my calendar but I told them probably next year because it looks really good cool all right well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me really appreciate it thank you and I

hope you sleep well tonight I will I'd take care all right great thank you so much for taking the time um so I'll have this up in the next couple days and and again I really appreciate you taking the time and not you know like I bumped in chi once and I try to talk to you at the end of on that I see any conference after you give you talk and you were very applied to me and I think I was

just gibbering away about something uh but uh you know well I was polite huh but doesn't know so no you stood and talked to me okay it was there was a big crowd you know and then I always appreciate when I see people doing that because it's it's it's so intimidating sometimes being in the audience trying to go up and talk to somebody mmm but I cuz you know you see them they're up on

the stage and you think Oh are they gonna Dane doctor to come down and toggle you and me a little peon in the audience I speakers are just nerds that are standing up there afraid and thinking man did everyone think I was an idiot oh thank God someone's coming to talk to me thank God didn't totally suck unless this guy's going to tell me it sucked he didn't tell me it sucked oh

thank god okay that's how it works yeah all right well thank you very much have a good day all right have a good night right user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversation zipaquira of information find out for yourself today yuk yuk a sitcom you

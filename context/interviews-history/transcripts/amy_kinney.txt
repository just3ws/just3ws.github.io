hi I'm Mike I'm standing here with a McKinney from second conf so hi Amy can you tell me a little bit about what second comfy is its conference here in Chicago but beyond that I don't know too much sure I'd love to tell you more about it second comp is really a conference about technologists who are passionate about creating interesting and exciting things so it sort of grew

out of the ashes of c-4 for people who are familiar with that conference but it's also its own conference in and of itself this is our third year we've expanded every year we've got about a hundred attendees it's a deliberately small conference so you can meet everyone you could talk to all the presenters it's just one of those great things where there's a wonderful

community of people who love to come this every year we have people coming from all over the US as well as internationally and my husband David Kinney and I run the conference and he likes to describe it as a kind of conference that he would like to attend if he was attending a conference so it's about interesting things new things happening with technology whether it be

iphone ipad apps or things happening with android or do we know i'm making kind of this more software focused yes I mean you will see code examples up there but you're also going to hear about people who are doing really creative things our first year chris rojas was there and he showed a video with a let me get this right it was a trampoline controlled flamethrower that utilize our

do we know that's that's pretty interesting it was it did you download on stage did you have a firework oh no no that's not a video so so no no no no flamethrower was actually at the conference our insurance would be very unhappy what is if we tried to do that Whitesnake I think it was that no sorry none of that either ya know okay so you said you've been doing this a couple

years now how many years this is our third year third year and yet so maybe looking at running a conference versus like attending what it what are some of the things you've learned running a conference was some was really kind of surprised you like there's a lot of things um no matter how much planning you do things will never quite go the way that you intend for them to go but

that's okay that's the nature of the conference as much planning as you do you're still going to end up running around like a chicken with your head cut off because things just get crazy the more you do something the better you get at it so you learn what things to do in advance how to set things up but each year pronunce new challenges we're at a new venue this

year at Willis Tower we have been with tech Nexus before but we outgrew the space literally and so that's exciting to be in a you know a larger conference base we could have a few more people without getting too big let's see always have backup plans backup plans for your backup plans whether it be speakers where people get sick at the last minute or just making sure that if you run out

of bottled water you know where the mayor yes your stories yeah to grab things and part of it one is having a great committee of people who work with you we have a conference committee who was really dedicated to helping us and the ocean yes working together and making sure that other people are thinking about things that you may forget about more I think that's

important and then to have a great group of attendees and people who just love to come to the conference enjoy the time together and people come to a conference for a number of different things to to see the speakers obviously so having high quality speakers is important but a lot of it is about enjoying the time of other people getting to meet new people learn new things I'm having a great time

and joined great food it's one of the things we pride ourselves having great food too yes that's always one of the trickiest things with conferences as well what's the food gonna be liking yes which is cold in fact that's really important to us I have special dietary needs myself and so one of the things we ask everyone is what are your special dietary needs we check in with everyone

make sure that everyone who comes there knows they will be well fed while taking care of their food is going to be safe for them as well so allergies everything we have everything from you know allergic to five different things to vegan to gluten-free dairy-free and everything else know when you said that you intentionally keep the attendance to a certain size yes has it ever become

like a problem in the last couple years where you might say oh we've counted a hundred but we didn't have enough people that actually showed up because there's always the nutrition rate there always is an attrition rate we do have some people who realize last minute they forgot they bought their tickets which seems odd to me but most the time people

can find someone who is willing to buy their trip ticket they can transfer it over we sold out in less than two hours this year and last year it was about six hours so kind of the running joke is that we tend to sell out faster than dub dub knows what well 73 years you're gonna be like oh we didn't even launch it on I know we do tell people when we're selling tickets and when we are

going to happen so it's not like a surprise p kurt you wake up one morning and we're sold out we don't do that but we haven't had a problem selling out quickly and everybody loves attending our event so it is always a struggle trying to balance having a small group with making sure that enough people can attend but so far you know most of the people who do want to attend or put

themselves on the waiting list because of attrition everything people do tend to get in so if you're still looking for a ticket put yourself on the waiting list or watch on twitter because there are always a couple of last minute people who who are still trying to sell or transfer their tickets okay well thank you very much for taking the time to talk to me and good luck with the

conference thank you

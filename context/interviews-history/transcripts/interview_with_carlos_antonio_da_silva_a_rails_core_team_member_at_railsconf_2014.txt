hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at railsconf 2014 and i'm sitting here with carlos antonio de silva who is a software developer with platform attack and you might also know some of these projects devise simple form it's also Wells core contributor give a talk today about some of the tricks the rels didn't teach you if I say that correctly yeah ticks out the radios didn't tell them

about the tricks entrails didn't tell you about right so thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me I appreciate it so can you tell me a little bit about a little bit more about tricks that Wales didn't tell me about right yes so the idea behind this talk is that like I've been working for use for around six years and I think a lot of different projects see a lot of

different codes from different people around the world and people get use it to writing their own code without actually looking at what radios can give them so there are times where we called it could be replaced by Brie use existing features features at work with is the newer versions or even features at work since the beginning in brain is fried and the idea was just so show some

nice tricks that Ray's has some small features features that people don't use that much and that can help them on a daily basis of while working afraid's and that can make their code better simpler and easier to understand so that's that's a whole idea behind what was an example of one that was a real common thing that you maybe when you're seeing contributions bacteria so it is

at a place where you often see those where people are contributing back redundant code or is this talking about applications of people writing with rails and they just keep reinventing the wheel yeah it's usually applications that before writing then try to reinvent the wheel because the right features that way so it gives them right they try to think that over complex and that

various can simplify by using some of the raid switchers so that was the idea of showing some of these tricks and maybe i will post more blog posts or something about the idea behind that was that for should first before actually going right in the local gold surged ask around and see if risk can help them in some way to make their code simpler okay and here we were

talking a little bit before the interview about your contributions to open source and I asked about platform attacking you said that it was kind of a funny story that he would pump to platform check through open source yeah yeah so it's been almost five years of the time working there I was actually the first external guy if we started working for the frontal tech besides the

four founders and I started because of open source because it was working as a freelancer back like five years ago and i was using one of the zeppoles project which is called inherited resources and I was talking to me in the Middle East and asking a bunch of stuff helping him with some issues and all that stuff he sent me an email asking if you if I would like to work with ending a project

what it was like just that project at the beginning because they were needing someone and somehow I don't know how they thought about me because it was talking to him and well then I did that project i started that project with them because of the open-source discussions we were having and after that I we started working together yeah so was that before you started working with the

rails team or yeah yeah that was before after that I started contributing to Reyes and then more and more since then so how did you go about becoming about the in contributing to Burrell score how to habitat come about yeah so after starting working at the farm attack well we got involved more in reduced because Josie was also part of the rails actually he got part of the risk or TV

2010 I guess but we were always discussing and every time we found a bug we tried to send up a request to fix that what the farm attack has this discovery of encouraging people to contribute more right so at that time we start with some minor bug fixes and trying to keep up to date with what was going on rails also and that was opening doors for us to

contribute more and more maybe fixing some documentation may be fixing some issue or like refactoring a code that just got murdered it's also a good way so I start contributing more and more and more like that and then there was them where I have like a thousand committee or something yeah that's that's a lot of commits yeah tokens ours so you're even quite prolific in a.m

that's a I thought inhibits interrail she made it to rave yeah yeah but that's not even counting on all the other project no no no okay so I so what was the processor to become a core team member what what how did that work they have a ceremony did they like the I told you know can you talk about it not sure well as I said that was like contributing more and more and as it was

contributing more i was actually needing more feedback from the guys that work or or probably contributed right so there was a time where they have me talk m51 where some contributors uh hang around there to talk about Grails talk about the issues and things like that so that was like the first getting to talk more about with the contributors guys and then we start contributing more and more

to raves because of that because we have like direct contact with them so when the contributing more and after that after some time they got that has access to the issue starter so we could close issues we actually have who had at that time access to commit to raise but we were not allow it to because it's like it hope does not allowed to block home commits give access to beaches so we

were giving access to issues but we're just not committed right right so that was more of just trust yeah that Martha such a way of trusting us that we will like help them features / requires nah this group s worth more than think some of the technology okay something like that well after some time working on issues and helping them before class and

reviewing call in other stuff they gave us access to commit commit access to real so we are we were that contributors I could watch purpose and our own community since things like that and now after like more than a year or so contribution like that more frequently they gave us the party part so that's the visible it's like flooding you know like II now you're feeling these rails

for the rest your life allowed to look at other frameworks I mean perform attack you guys do a lot of a lecture too right yeah yeah we we are mostly focusing on were using Ruby right but we are also developing elixir you'll be applying for some projects but you know like we're free to use other other technologies or the frameworks is necessary there is no prob that's the

job yeah yeah now is the best to do we have for doing our jobs and speed of other tools expanding beyond just rels proper some of the extensions you've worked on a simple form there's you know there used to be form tastic well there still is your show is fantastic but there's an alternative now with your simple form what's you from them saying you created that project yeah they did

yeah I and I so what what led to that what pain did you feel that kg I want to create an in general or open-source birds they all came out from real projects from experiences we have these projects like device for example we had an application and we were having problems if the authentication solution we were using and we decided to create around sore problem right life and

device is very popular now it's yeah it I mean ask a huge Trinity around using us yeah a lot of people have been using device and it's been great it hearing feedback from people here that they really love device and use them use the two and now and device was really did like almost five years ago and simple form is going to be four years ago so it's a

little bit less than device about super for most similar to we were working on a project that had a bunch of forms very customized phones because the client was a designer actually right so he like this i need this is really nice interface with all forms and I'll different markup and from task wasn't really doing you know helping us from doing that so we had to do our own our

own farm pewter for that in that project right after like we are finishing that perfect we decided to extractor and turn into a jam the simple form jam which could help us in other projects and the bass ke dev enhancing performance allows you to have flexible marker right so it helped us a lot in that project name has been helping Eunice yeah I have used all of your work so great can I use it at

every day and the one thing I'm curious what with device though is that's a sensitive piece of infrastructure that's that my I put that into my appt you know it's it's a big lot of trust because there's a lot of stuff going on there i don't necessarily dig into or and it's you know you know integrating with morning it's too much on vacation it's two different algorithms for encryption

how much for learning experience has i've been working with creating device and yeah the big meat was really great first life i had one year one year or so working with free useful plan and it was really a great learning experience at the beginning it was my first actual you jam that I was guilty and I learned a lot about certification process how to view the jam

and helping the great things of radius by other and we actually have improved a lot of integration detection zone where you since them and the nice thing is that we could make device before our other gems I always keep up to date with new arraylist versions and it has been a really great learning experience every new big version of device that we release we need to change a lot of

things and we learn more on how the authentication part words what are the problems we we have on that matter how we need to be safe from doing things we need but I just screw the certification it's important for people is security right so there's a lot involved in that so we try to beat the mosaic we can and I'm also curious because the device is its associated with perform attack

pinned and it's open source I mean even though in open source you are someone relinquishing liability has there been any concern or anybody ever sour working on it because maybe something went wrong and there they come back to such foreign wondering about the dark side of doing open source development here I just when you think about create something you put it out there and it's a sensitive piece

of infrastructure has that been something that you've had that among any hard lessons about coming back and saying hey this that's where gravy well it is simply impossible to make everyone happy but so what we try to do our best to try to help people that most we can we have a mailing list where we direct people to get help whether more people involved we have special secret place

where people can send us security problems if they are having or if they think they found something that could be a security issue and device and so it's hard to to the action no that was very interesting so if if somebody like people get in trouble out in the real world for discovering security issues i discovered security tree how do you go about if you're saying that you actually

have yeah we have certain sclerosis like Rose has a security process very well define it right there is a mini ina may you have sand especially may even know that stuff we have any made for device to where it can send a there is a contributors marked on filing the device we put in qatari look there is the email there and you need to send me to that particular address and then you guide

you today we have seen already people like sister from the internet about a possible security problem that's not good right yeah yeah that's a good thing you're just undermining the work you're doing yeah instead of just tell you you're not like some who just wants to sue you in the Libyan you know you're going Mongo fix it yeah yeah and they try like to have a real process behind

it and it's I could communicate with the guy who is sending the issue to us and get it fix it as soon as possible refer it as it can be like a migration or it can be a big issue with that can affect like lots of versions so we have as we use we have released like 30 4 versions older versions of device because of security issues already see we try to have that Frost was there any in

particular with this whole heart freed openssl security problem that I'm actually even my my wife is not a developer even she asked me do we need to go change our passwords I heard about this this was a heck that's something that you've had to deal with with device or mostly this up and just educating know basically we were not affected by anything that we could heard of so far

at least a place nothing inside of yeah it's 97 dr. PI's cold okay well thank you very much for taking time to Us Weekly appreciate it thank you thanks happy user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yeah geodesic calm

you

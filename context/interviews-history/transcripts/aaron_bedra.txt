hi i'm mike i'm here with aaron bedre aaron has contributed to the closure language he's also spoken extensively on closure and functional programming and all kinds of other neat stuff here geek fest and well a few conferences like no fluff just stuff railsconf and also closure conch yeah okay I'm strange loop okay really right now we're just looking at the relaunch of the closure Cohen's

website and I just want to ask it this is a teaching tool closure Cowen's it's a teaching tool for fruit what can you describe what closure concert yeah so the whole thing actually started Jim wyrick and edge case had put together Rubicon's for you know learning really exploring the language they were really well done I I picked them up just one of the suit was going on and I really

enjoyed the teaching style I'm gonna really like how that works and that style of you know explained something very simple concept and show how it works is also presented in like the little whisper and the reason schemer and and in those books I really like that kind of very close one to one teach a small concept and kind of evolved it and you're also so close to the source

code you're not in another tool and a little less yeah and you know you a small amount of work can be done just kind of bend the language and into a little dsl you know Ruby it and then close your both have some some great ways to do that so you kind of bend it to your will and make it work the way you want and you kind of create this little learning environment so I I tried

to mimic what Jim had done with the Ruby cones very closely because I like that style right and and then after that get a Colin Jones avail it actually took I mean he's contributed I think way more than I have at this point he really put us on yeah he saw it he embraced it and really went with it and the new closure codes website is actually a product of 8th might as well its enclosure it is it

is did you know did you know framework yeah and so you know those guys really took they did all the work here all right what it really wasn't me I started the project by 2010 at code much okay so this is actually a project at a conference yeah so that code mash 2010 a whole bunch of folks that talked about you know through be cones they they were becoming popular at that point with said

hey what about a set a functional language cones we actually started the project as the collection of Scala and F sharp closure I haven't a lot of people participated because it were true it was just kind of functional and you just had an umbrella yeah this kind of seems to focus so the Scala off into their own repository and over to bitbucket and those kind of their they're much more

popular there now and so Colin and I talked about just making our own closure cones ok that's kind of where that came from and everything kind of started there since then it's actually forked off to its own engine and then all you do is provide the exercises ok so other people have approached about doing things like the castle log cones and maybe the core logic cones it's not

known like a plug-in yeah there's a lot that's lining and plug in and there's an engine you install and it actually will set up a cone for whatever cones project for whatever you want ok then you just add to call yeah you just had the exercises and go so it's actually less of a modular thing now and it's it's become kind of nice little way to to start to teach something about your

project or some concept but you know this was just the Costa College about the language right no add-ons no plugins the way it's built is you know pretty pretty simple just using a couple of macros and some little tricks ok and I I'm going to jump straight from closure collins to talk about some of some more education done through your book yeah you you co-authored with tom no dr.

house yeah I just I knew Stuart I also going to say small layer but sup but you co-authored a book with him what was that like coming from closure and being a coder and then writing a technical book so technical books are you know this is my this is my first big book right I dunce I've done work for peep-toe for jeffrey grissom Bach wrote a small book on rail security several

years back it was much smaller so this was a bigger endeavor about 300 pages this book ended up being and so and but it was a second edition of stews book so that was our foundation so it was much more daunting than the people got booked for me but it was also less because it wasn't a blank slate right and so with that I mean you you you'd been you've obviously been

doing closure for a very long time and you've contributed to the code base how much of writing the book was having a learn new stuff versus had codifying thinking I definitely learned stuff during the process of writing the book a lot was brain dump right it was like so that that part was nice it was pretty easy i was working in closer every day i was working on the language at least one

day a week if not all week sometimes and so it's nice to be able to kind of brain dump X I was right in the middle of it all right and I think that makes for a good a good conversation did you ever have a point where you're like writing the book and then you're like wow when you're researching earlier I've been doing it wrong all along and then like changed what you were how you were yeah

when you were in digging deep maybe into a topic I think it might have changed the way I I did some things enclosure but not for the book for the book it was you know still pretty introductory keep teaching concepts and those concepts really didn't change my right between the two versions of the book some of the some of the code and examples change quite a bit and that was based on

learning new stuff in the language and and evolved in the language right yeah this first edition that's do a wrote was kind of pre one da know right around 10 and this book is are going to 13 and up ok so the language that have also got a bit and between closure what I no one got three there were lots of changes so if somebody picks up the book it's still relevant yeah absolutely yeah this is

you know a couple things have been released since then but there are this this book is still very relevant you won't find code examples broken or now that nothing has changed interface wise ok so the code examples will still work even if you use them with you know one not for one at five as far as I know right I've tried some most of them so okay and uh you know just the last kind

of group of questions is you've gotten and spoken at a lot of different conferences you've gone and railsconf rocks no fluff stuff closure conch very different communities yes just in those three confidence yeah do you talk about when topics or do you tend to like have the same topic but maybe tailor it for that audience so I talk about different stuff you know a devil Taylor for the

audience always doing it for the audience having a good conversation where everybody's on the same page is really important you know I think the idea of a talk is more to inspire that it is to teach right because you only have a short amount of time right you really can't teach some but you can teach a group of one hundred to a thousand people much in an hour right

right that's brand mile basically said the same thing it's you come out you do a little entertainment you share some knowledge and then you try to get them to go and yeah it is really about inspiring it's about somebody's taking away something you said that excited that and then going in researching and learning on their own and you might have just fuel that that that learning and

that's what might the goal of my conference talks will they are is to to fuel exploration okay and just when you're preparing for your presentations are you one of those types of people that likes to sit down and figure out this is my script or if you kind of just say I know this thing here's the general gist of what I want to talk about I always read that line okay so i'll fire

up emacs a nord mode and write in that line and you know that has gotten me through lots of things okay and the reason I do that is because the story is important and when you break that down it gets rough to follow and if you go here moving really fast because you know an hour's a long time so you having me quickly if you skip a beat and go off somewhere else and don't really

transition well it's hard to follow yeah you know if you get out for two part of a script yeah so that that outline the outline helps make sure the story is gonna go the same place which like to finish and then after that I felt it details and slides do you ever go and do like some some people like to kind of work the user group circuit sure they do you go in and do premat pre

presentations at user groups to try out sometimes yes sometimes no it just depends on what's around what user groups are happening I'll use geekfest Air Group on it as platform sometimes it happens more regularly every week right so there's more chances to hit there you never know whether or not you're gonna be around on a certain user group night and you know

they only happen once a month so it's harder but yeah user groups are definitely a great place to test ideas oh great well thank you very much for taking your stuff thanks

hi I'm Mike I'm at Windy City rails again I'm standing here with Steven Anderson who runs the mad railers and the ice involved with a Madison Ruby up in well Madison Wisconsin so welcome thank you for a few minutes to talk with me I can you tell me a little bit about top what mad railers is and what you're doing up in up in medicine well Matt railers friend and I started that in

early two thousand six right after we did the first agile web development with rails book in a book club okay and he went on to start teaching rails at the tech college and and he and I launched the users group okay and I inherited the user group from him a few years later I'm still involved in running it up many other people helped run it as well yeah and it's really blossomed lately we

typically have about 20 people at a meeting and we have a wide range of things we do the next couple will be focused their next one will be introduction for newbies kind of introduction to rails in order after that we're going to split into we're going to do Cowen's and Cotto's okay so all we can choose more of a hands-on and then also more of a lecturer talking

etype we have traditionally been kind of oriented towards having people talk on the subject but i'm personally trying to move us towards more doing I'm going to resurrect open hack days again and other people in Mad railers who want to host hack evenings are welcome to do the same I like to do the days just because a full day let's see bite off meteor problems yeah and the

when I talked to Jim Ramsey I yesterday can I describe that Madison is a very interesting culture and has said something that like with the Madison Ruby tries to make sure that it really incorporates the the local flavor of medicine into the conference is that something that's affected how you work with Matt railers that it has medicine has its own unique culture and in in

vibe it certainly does we don't talk about it much man y'all in medicines overall officials I talk about the sea right right but as Jim and Jen are running medicine ruby conference they're very focused on that and exposing technologists from around the nation and the world two aspects that are wonderful about madison and madison heights who participate in the conference love it as

well because it opens our eyes to things that we hadn't been thinking about yeah just some that's maybe kind of hidden in plain view you see it all the time but come in and everybody kind of has fresh eyes the other thing is really awesome about the conference's that Jim runs is the the way they bring in master craftspeople in other crafts people who are not Ruby and rails are

not programmers or designers but come and talk to us about their craft in their passion yeah and seems like the favorite talks are generally not about hundred yeah yeah it's something that's a little bit unique kind of jumping back to you the handsome you said you'd like to do them during the hands-on sessions you like to do them during the day versus a night how do you work that with

people's schedules I mean all sometimes we do these are groups at night because that's when people are off work well what I do is I just kind of say hey I've got the energy to spend a Saturday in to host an open hack days what's all I can host it okay and anyone and everyone who can make it is welcome to join let's not like Wednesday it sits on a genre the weekend it's turned out right and it's

something above and beyond the regular meetings and another idea that I want to pitch to the user group is something we did at bendy works are our software company we did an internal conference or about to do our second and there's a really great dynamic and having you know very among friends by and for friends yeah it's a very low pressure introduction for speaking you know many

people early geek fest was yeah and I want to pitch that to the group I think that would be pretty wonderful imagining something along the lines of a bar camp yeah yeah those are a lot of fun low pressure safe environments them in edison probably one of the best things i think about user groups as they generally provide when Shiva stablished a presence in the group it's a little

bit safer you don't feel that's like coming to a conference on having to set up and in front of a hundred plus strangers that dozen or so people that you know seems to be much softer and can lead to bigger and better things no and I just real quick we kind of mentioned before we were when we were chatting about Benny works having kind of a interesting

relationship with other might be other competitors oh yeah yeah so you know you showed me how your laptop has stickers from a half dozen companies that might otherwise be called competitors if you or maybe flying for the same market or well it's part of the joy in what we do were participants in a community that is so so friendly and so supportive and we're experiencing you a market with

enough demand that frankly most of the time our problems are along the lines of who can I trust to refer a client I can't help right now right who rather than oh I have to you know scratch and claw to land the next gig right that's a pretty wonderful spot to be in yeah and it's so much fun to talk to other people who are running shops like ours and swap stories and has had been something that

you know that you're solving firm that you're involved with the community his that ever and somewhere you have you ever hired somebody out of that you'd met just through the user group oh yeah the bendy works itself sprung into existence as a side effect of supporting the user group amongst other dynamics yeah I started helping the user group and and doing things and talking about

Ruby and rails and teaching Ruby on Rails without ever thinking it would become a company well yeah that's a good way to go about it and also it's been our main source of of employees that every you know support the community right help people grow skills and every now and then somebody really stands out that it excites us that we want them to be part of our group that's very

interesting so it's it's it's it's a very synergistic ecosystem that you build the the group you build a framework for people to be able to come in and safe and have fun and share and learn and grow and then you're growing and then you start your own company and then you're able to help these people come up and they're all having a good time so the worst cases they come on

they have a good time they learned something new in most cases it yeah they're coming they join bendy works but there's other outcomes to like I really enjoy helping somebody who might become a bendy work nothing and and see them join a different interesting company and rails is really blossomed in Madison yeah there's so many shops doing rails now where when we started it blue sky

like what yeah yeah what's this thing you're talking about yes it's it's like cut on a little bit more into them yes well thank you very much even for taking time to speak

it's my cue cassock I'm so here go to conf 2015 I'm standing here right now with dr. Sengupta who gave a talk about how she helped with the Mars missions the curiosity mission without the parachute and in some very fascinating things thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me so your talk what what was the gist of your talk so the top was to talk

about how difficult it is to land on Mars yes and specifically how difficult it was to land the Curiosity rover on Mars okay then talk about how we actually designed the entry descent and landing system some of the details and the capabilities of the rover Curiosity in terms of the science that it's capable of doing and some of the science results

which have been collected over the past two you were actually part of the team that helped it sound like it actually described them you talked there was thousands of people involved but your aspect was was what part of the aspect of the landing what were you involved in so I was a member of the entry descent landing engineering team so that probably was around twenty to fifty

people during the lifecycle of the mission and so my role in particular was the engineer for the parachute so responsible for qualifying the supersonic parachute and then also developing the test sequence which allowed us to assess what the environment was gonna be like at the very end of the stack read the new variant at the landing event this was

very dramatic shots of the of the lander coming in and the fully opened that was it was part of your you're doing yes so that that's absolutely amazing and when you were describing the amount of effort that goes into figuring out just how much of parachute I mean we look at a parachuting skydiver so they just popped parachute and that's it I mean what what was involved in

parachute on Mars so there's a lot of design work which has to be done upfront which is primarily related to quantifying the type of environment that it's gonna see on Mars because it gets deployed and a much higher speed then it gets deployed it here on earth and it also gets deployed in a much thinner atmosphere that gets deployed out on earth so that results into being a very

difficult aerodynamic problem in terms of understanding what kind of loads the parachutes indices so we did a whole variety of analyses using computer codes computational fluid dynamics structural mechanics as well as a lot of testing so they build full-scale parachutes we built subscale Tarrasch parachutes and we test them in as close as we can to the environment that they'll see on Mars

like one of the one of the many fascinating things you touched on is that you talked about doing the testing upfront and the early planning stages so that way when the system finally was really some Mars it would it had to work one time and that was it otherwise yeah yeah so you showed all kinds of demonstrations of different types of analysis and testing wind tunnels

showing the fluid he said there was a look like water going around the parachute but it was actually the air itself I mean all of these devices were being used to take you know hard maths and turn them into experiments it could be reasoned about in with FEMA as a layman I can look at that and a couple I can see how that air was coming out and it was causing the parachute to to

malformed and things like that I also made me think about those old pictures of the early NASA scientists with their giant chalkboard of calculations and formulas worse where's the you know like that visualization of it's so hard that it's hard to even to formulate the question is it you know there's there's all kinds of mathematics that have to go out of your head and

turn into computer simulations I mean where does that chalkboard go is that this is there still that child formulas somewhere but maybe just in the computer I mean like how does that even work so you can think of the chalkboard as a one-dimensional calculation or a single node calculation and so follow the physics that go into the trunk or calculation still go into our

calculations but now they get coupled to a highly resolved three-dimensional model of the parachutes so the same physics existed as existed back then but now with the advent of computers and specifically supercomputer clusters we can actually take the flow field surrounding a parachute and divide it up with millions and millions of handle cells and actually do those computations

each cell to give us a much better resolution of what's going on in the flow field wow it actually facilitates these types of missions that it actually reduces the cost to implement these missions because now we can run simulations instead of multiple test sequences and usually get away with just did one test sequence there those of us who are doing app development we think

that we're doing test-driven development when we write a little test harness you guys are building massive infrastructures to verify that this one thing is this one event is gonna happen and it just he probably heard several heads popping in the audience just thinking about it because we hear about it in in the the media and it's on Twitter and it's kind of an abstract

thing but there's there's people like yourself were really making this stuff happen and that's something maybe we lose touch with and you did mention about the stem and and he showed a very odd kind of telling picture of your team and you're the only female and it was all guys so you were also talking about being able to attract more diverse women and people of different nationalities

you know is that something that is it's and make it in JPL and nasa dissolve middle-aged white guys or is that just to your team I think it's probably unique to aerospace it's unique to a lot of unfortunately hard science field so aerospace mechanical electrical computer science physics a lot of times for whatever reason not enough women go into that as a career choice in undergraduate

so and we need to fix that I don't have the solution for fixing and I think probably one of the first things we should do is have more female role models which is why I do a lot of public outreach because I think it's important for girls to see other women doing these things as a good career path as an acceptable career path so I think that's probably because if you take a look at

even in my own University you know there's usually a one or two female professors per department tops so they're just not enough women in the field which then it's sort of like a self-fulfilling prophecy yeah and as far as also like stem you know those of us who are over over 30 and say we didn't really have the key concept of stem I'd say even maybe people in their 20s

didn't have stem is it been around long enough for this concept to have any impact on the hiring or are you seeing any change from from where you stand as a scientist working in an established team is there any change maybe in the interns or anything because of some of those efforts have you seen I certainly have learned the number of myself but we don't have a lot of interns come in

every summer and usually do you get a pretty good ratio of about 50 50 males to females and then I also teach at University of Southern California and there I see around you know thirty to forty percent females in the class so I think it's getting better and I think ironically the fact that space exploration and space travel is becoming cool and being even nerdy or decays

becoming yellow I think it makes it more acceptable it's more culturally acceptable as I think that's actually gonna help a lot more women enter the field you know at the undergraduate level it was started from there yeah excellent yeah and I mean being able to see programs I mentioned earlier another person I interviewed Bob Pollin who did

the deadlocks for kids here in Chicago forgot to take my daughter to that and I hear she's she's six and getting her to do scratch programming in the thinking about that and and then looking at some of the seeds that are being now gonna follow up in the in their decades it's extremely exciting sometimes it's it's a little intimidating but you know being a parent but it's it's it's great

to see I say this good to see a woman up there talking but just anybody up there talking and knowing that they were involved in something that went beyond our day-to-day world and it's like I sort of asked you a question earlier did you actually get to touch I mean the equipment that went to Mars and and you had a very interesting answer that I'll just ask it again did you did you

actually get the touch any of the equipment that went to Mars so we actually do our best to not touch yes I get sent to Mars because we have something called planetary protection where we don't want to bring any base bacterial or microbial spores to Mars because we want to contaminate Mars so we don't want to contaminate Mars for two reasons one because you know to

protect it any potential life forms that could be there none that we know that already and also not to contaminate our own biological experiments all right performing yeah you mentioned something about how there was a concern over some methane that's been seen in a previous experiment that people weren't sure if it was just and there's just one part

per billion I think it's what you said a very tiny tiny number but it doesn't take much yes you have to be very careful to make sure that you understand like what the control is so that you can be sure that what you're referencing what you're reading is in a real measurement right and just knowing that I'm getting to talk to somebody with just one degree away from you

summing things to Mars is this is kind of odd you know but it's it was very very good to be able to speak with you I appreciate you taking the time and I hear at the end of the the first day of the conference and and that's it thank you very much

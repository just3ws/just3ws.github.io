hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here gotta go to comp 2014 I'm cydia with Courtney hempel who it would talk about building products for customers which might sound kind of redundant but it's something that is she described we don't always think about the range software so thank you very much for taking the time to speak that we live hi can you tell me what you mean by designing software for

our customers sure and I reviewed the report of things that they have that objective but it's trickier than you think and then what we found you know we were the development shop since 2000 we've done agile XP from the get-go and we found that that process actually was what allowed us to deliver software as quickly as possible to our clients what we found out was that oftentimes what

you were giving your clients might not actually be with market was looking for and some of our clients have made that realization as well we ended up partnering with some incredible design firms we work with I do hot studio and they were fantastic in helping us craft beautiful vision for the products however once you start taking through the vision making a reality and you

imagine their changes that need to be made and interfaces are very specific to how users will engage with them and they have a technical component so we have decided and we've been doing this for about six years to bring sort of the design closer to the development so the taught that i paid was how our teams of developers and now with embedded designers that are on site at carbon 5

and that are part of our team are working together very iterative leon a weekly fashion to both plan and come up with hypotheses each week that they're testing against and that they are looking to gain an actual metric against at the end of the week for putting in front of users and really computing or validating the hypothesis about that product or that feature service so

you're actually really doing experimental work I mean to say okay this is what I think it's going to be the result and then measure that and see if it actually was and when you mention i do that's a very interesting company to work with the if you don't know i do they their product design company sure so they create things meet space that people really use how

did that working relationship affect you know something that was more we usually think it wasn't tangible which software did they do that collaboration change the way you approached usability Ian sure it's a it's a good question and two points that I'd want to pull out there is one I think where you're sort of angling at did this idea of you know what is supper means in today's world

where it's really not just these intent what kind of digital interfaces it really has a lot more than that I will say you know one of the more interesting projects that we had with idea was for genentech and it was for a TED conference and we were literally putting together what was termed a genetic symphony of participants at Ted and so people would actually come to the event

they would suave using a DNA stick and we would actually get the DNA for that particular person and we would chart that based on sort of like the heretics of their DNA again sort of the musical composure so is a very sort of you know artistic endeavor and it very much had a software component backing it there was kind of the algorithms against the DNA and musical components you're recruiting

a symphony of these attendees but there was obviously an experience process that was designed by idea so it was a very intense project and they're gonna lie but because it was packed bite of that which happens you know at a moment in time but it was an incredible engagement and what was successful about it was every day we had communication since I do every day we were sort of testing and

you know the original vision was huge and what we helped them to do was sort of take you know the easiest slices of the pie we could do in order to make this a reality and sort of dropping the bells and whistles and you know leading some time to bring back the ones that were most critical but trying to sort of take a stab at the full experience and making sure if you get it done by that

inventing and that's sort of what we have seen is to be big successes that you can do a lot but what you wanted to do is just enough to make it so that it is a success and whether it's a sense as an event or as a product that you're coming to market with that's what really is a company we're trying to optimize right and now I'm term that you can imagine the beautiful components because

you're it's even a third dimension a software product that you're delivering that's going to heaven interfaces people actually swab it and there's a physical thing that has to be done that I'm not sure how that would be there is a lot on baby parts yeah and then trying to creep like them artistically did you work with musicians to hope we did idea brought in some

musicians that were there to sort of set to score and the scores are sort of backed you know peach a middle person has sort of the DNA profile and there can be sort of groupings of these profiles so what we were doing was instead of trying to literally put a note to every potential DNA string what we were doing is taking these DNA trade sort of these segments of strings and

putting a note to them so that way we were sort of minimizing the amount sort of variables in the iteration and that's how we manage that is this talk available do beautiful like that I definitely like to have that well I should that the talk that I gave isn't about the genentech stuff is about to other projects that I worked on so we've worked on a lot of projects this is sort

of one that I was pulling up from the I do the talk actually is about two companies want to call book Rena and the other one is called shear through and one was the data visualization of effectively sort of sharing of videos through different channels like Google+ and Twitter and what have you and ways in which you can pull out sort of when a video went viral and beauty influencers

were bookrunner was a project that we did where we were comparing we were trying to enhance the experience of kids that are in college they're trying to purchase textbooks and allowing them to have more transparency into what their options were right now including Amazon including book writer including the university bookstore so we were trying to do it you know when and where it

mattered to them in the bookstore and using SMS and mobile web can to facilitate that endeavor yes it could be first I've seen a sister-in-law recently graduated it's ludicrous yeah the amount of money and requirements to my books it's frightening I know which is why i love that company is because they were being really honest and authentic about it right so you know sure you're

describing how you printed these products I'm sorry this is a early today I'm trying to do I keep up but it's okay so you show you your presentation you described it's the process yeah the presentation is what were what we did with both of these companies and we were sort of optimizing its process during the course of these two projects is we would sit down with the team and this is

the full team misses you know developers designers and the product owner it's really the balance team music carbon 5 and having those you know people and that was it just three there are more developers and just one their potential moin-moin designer but coming up we sort of the plan for the week you know particularly the book writer case it was will people really understand these

shelf tags and how to get access to these prices right what's like the fastest way on an SMS flip phone to get to the prices that we want them to see so we would come up with hypothesis well we think it will take you now to entering a new modes and we want to engage them you know with a small bit ly URL to cure at whatever units we've come up with these hypotheses some of which

sort of had high product risk or high technical risk and so we were you know the talk is sort of how we were putting that in front of users as quickly as possible every week to make sure that we were creating a product that these users would use the second part of the talk is really the anchor of our cadence which is three what we call it this weekly iteration cycle and that's when we be

burnin users whom you test them so whatever we thought they would do we had to validate that on friday with the customer and so we would be working and developing and designing an actual production writing code base that we would then release we were doing continuous release but on friday we would bring in called it five on friday a footprint of ivory we have beers bring

in some students you know these are technology to him chart we would have not tried you know so don't give certificates a name we tell us as his greater now when he would tune an experiment if you had multiple experiments that seemed to be trending in maybe a not necessarily positive way in reserve a strategy did that ever happen where he had to be shorted on the

path and then interesting to not be a positive how did you I love that question I thought it is the relevant one right yeah so we all you share grew because that's actually the best case example that we went down a path for the first maybe three weeks that was sort of we used to three a JavaScript framework for visualization of data and interaction

and we initially be too despite that was pretty quick because we were used t3 and really harness sort of fake data and put it in front of users and sort of see if they could into it what we were trying to get them to see we failed miserably the first week the good thing about sort of the way that we're coding is that we're putting into our code a very flexible sort of domain structure and so

at the bare minimum you know we know the users are aiming for we know sort of their behavioral characteristics we know some of the domain language and we're coding that sort of into the production code and then we will do spikes so spikes are sort of opportunities for us to maybe not do as test-driven development and they're in a branch they're completely separate from the

master and that's the ones where we can really do some wild testing if it works then we fill out the tests and we pull it back into the master if it doesn't work we can kind of let that spent go okay the great thing about that is we have two opportunities one so we can kind of go away from the norm and not be scared about you know messing up the core code base and secondarily when you

have sort of an easy prototype to mess around with you can actually real time mess around with it so we know mess with things and from and then try it again with that we also did this thing called hybrid prototyping where we would take for the visual language in the interface and we would put it on a whiteboard we would draw a sort of you know graph around it and say okay use your finger

as a mouse talk us through what you would expect us here what you would want to see and that saves us entire week of coding because they got sort of the visual language of what we had presented to them before they could use that to the dance room saying I would have preferred any seen it yeah or this would be more helpful yeah so like I clicked this nightmare i'm expecting to see the

shoes as i selected in this in my online store and the ability don't say this was large for me you don't think whatever yeah i mean for the marketers in this case what they were doing mice it was hard for them to see immediately where they needed to clip to find what they call the influencers in the channels the people did will tweet about a video and make it go viral and so they were saying

I wish this node stood out warm she was bigger and she was more indicative the amount of shares that you know launched from them so that's what influenced us sales and when you were describing experiments and working these spikes and then bringing them back in and then backfilling test you know there's a lot of people that think or test over the relevant means I just sit

down and read a test and then check to see whether it did what I expected to do and that's a really little thing but some like what you're doing is really test driven I literally the scientific word for test where you you just create something and then see how did that sure and then I actually question came up yesterday and it really appreciated it I think that there is a distinction be

made between testing your code which is effectively you know unit testing and i would say interrupt my trying to say functional testing road that's different to me and we do do that in the for anything that is in the core code does need to be tested from the spikes absolutely are an edge case and we're still testing there but we might not be doing a stringent sort of like test

versus make it fail and then make it past only because we're looking for speed but you know not having test coverage in your code base is something that actually I don't I think it's really comforting for the long run when you're doing production third but we are also doing what I would say more is like market testing and that is very different i mean you know testings

working in turn around a lot I think these are two different things than we are very in favor of the scientific method using that sword for the marketing testing because I think it makes us sort of a little bit more honest about what we're doing and it allows all voices to be heard development design and product and additionally it has something to back

sort of the yes or no so often times particularly if you're a business owner you can be really sort of wedded to your ideas and for them to become convinced that that idea is really not kind of work in the market we stop the way when you've configured it it takes their users to tell them that and it couldn't wait for developers a lot of the time they'll be like no this is the best

technological approach and for users to come back and be like I do not get lazy I hear whether you jus bi or really they don't yeah they're happening with a BP we to trace the IP seriously number be sometimes they weren't there like I just want you have show me the graph like in an Excel doctors yeah but you're like oh yeah but that's what they're already comfortable exactly and I've been

holding the street runoff subscription totally well thank you very much particular maybe I should I appreciate you taking user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today at Utah State com you

hi it's Mike with you casting I'm here at railsconf 2014 and I'm standing here with Laius who runs that gopher ruko and she helps out with rails comp and also once ever comfort also interesting she so I've been involved in building open-source communities and projects for a number of years and I don't write much code I'm going to focus on areas of the projects that are sort of underserved

which means a lot of events a lot of logistics a lot of infrastructure teens figure out what their teams need to look like and the user groups and events and that face-to-face contact is a really important part of a new community building that sort of feel right the thing that makes you want to be there and certainly it's important part of maintaining that feel once you've

established it for for bigger communities events in particular or something where you haven't done it before it seems like this magical black box of mystery I find it very high-value for me to sort of help people who are it dim dated by the task but I'm just as smart I can get done and sorta sees them through those first blocks that might be in their way and for the most part once

they sort of get the answers to some of their more pressing questions and like oh I got this now I can do this all the time it's great with the user groups I've talked to other people who also want my advice to them it's been it's not as hard as it sounds there's there are tools out there don't try to write your own whose Meetup yeah use use the tools are out there call it teach

yourself in the community in 24 months and it's important with yourself as well as with your potential audience to set realistic expectations right so I've run a number of user groups that when they started where it's really it can be really challenging to consistently get the content or food to donate their space and so you sort of want to be

really careful about what you promise people so that they're not disappointed in you but if you're upfront about the fact that like hey this is sort of a passion project for me I'm doing this fun thing in my spare time so the most part instead of being demanding they're like yeah I like having a schedule I like for it to be sort of regimented and I'd like for it to be a representation

of what is the difference receipt between user group versus right it's not like oh well I ordered plenty people so then I just order people if it's up to 700 people right it's a lot more logistical overhead there's a lot more things that you have to put careful thought into to make sure that people have a really good experience similarly it is the sort of thing where hopefully

have the right instincts for it's not necessarily the skills that you're going to get from maybe being a user group organizer aren't necessarily going to translate the baseline and they're the healthy baseline and there's certainly the right place to figure out if you even enjoy that kind of thing but I think probably wanted to scare your things that a lot of people have done is

jump from their first and I run our user group of 3040 people - I'm not doing this who are one-day conference 100 Gorge people so start small I guess is the first dip right don't don't be too ambitious recognize of their challenges my people have done it before talk to them brainstorm with them so many of the things that I sort of screwed up the

first couple times around are things that clearly now I could just write on a piece of paper right and if someone had told me like don't use that stuff to that pay attention to this a lot easier so hopefully I do a lot of it to be clear my talk is about sort of running it open for centric company not specifically something like balance or whatnot there's a whole I'm talking

about building companies that are around open source where the company wants to do further the goal of some open source project where it's part of the culture that you give back a little bit about some of the challenges you face I'm going to talk about sort of talking the other stakeholders who are necessarily engineers our company doing a lot of good in the community so I wanna tell

the product skylight yeah we've been working together for a year people here are really receptive they it's really nice to see people sort of want to help you with your products because they use the open source stuff if you've invested it and it sort of feel like Oh wearing it together I'm going to give you a shot I'm gonna listen to what you have to say right now

thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us appreciate it thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today yeah geodesic calm you

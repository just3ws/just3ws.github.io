hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at go to conquer 2014 i'm standing with max damar Singh there's going to be presenting on graph databases and both with graph databases with neo4j they also runs the neo4j or i should say the Windy City graph DB database database user group that's a mouthful Windy City graph DB meet up here in Chicago max thanks for taking the time to speak with

me so your presentation what is the title of the presentation and what is kind of the gist of what you're going to be talking about sure so the plantation is basically just interleukin-2 graph databases and the idea of the presentation is to take you through a bunch of different use cases or things you can do with the graph whether you're building a new social network where

you're looking at mission management or network ontology its many different places where graphs fit way to one of the models in your pjs that grabs her everywhere we kind of want to show that and say look they really are everywhere so I mean for people who might be familiar with a relational database what's the difference between something like neo4j A&R DBMS the difference is

how we handle relationships in a relational database you're always joining every time you make a query you're asking find a way to connect these two things together in the graph we don't do that instead we connect when you create things okay the relationships get created ahead of time and that gives you is ability to say how is even connected by a pointer that I can

reverse directly I don't have to worry about how big my team I join tables get anything that everything is an 01 cost to you when you're trying to join two things together and that helps you scale when you have highly connected components in your data model okay and so it's it's it's not quite analogous to a foreign key relationship described in in in a party BMS it's it's something

like a relationship is its own entity yeah and and to be honest it is kind of a foreign key it's really different key is in memory and it's a pointer so it's not a different table you have to go and scan and find it's really it's just right there waiting for you and what really makes it fascinates you know computer science there's no magic it's always data structures in our bedroom so

we have a data structure that's optimized for connecting things together and that's different tween us and relational database routine and Neil 4j that's not like a close source that's on like Oracle or some like that that's that's another interesting aspect of this presentation is that neo4j is open source yeah absolutely sex no business library has been around for about 10

years if you want to use the communication you're welcome to use it anywhere you use my sequel I do a lot of examples also on my blog at maximize com where I show you everything I do and have all the source code available and get up to free to download and play with it and build your own stuff with it you know it's one nice things about working in those companies that everything I do

it gets to be open source I don't have to worry about it you know there's a few bits and pieces at our crime code than your clinic closed source but India and I every tongue goes around it make blog post out of the many ways right so there's always that that's sharing and and just in the spirit of sharing going to the user group itself ah the Windy City graph TB user group which probably

reads a lot easier than that then rolls off the tongue but you re the founder of the group or are you an organizer over there sure i started the coop about two years ago because i fell in love in here for did the product yeah and i was a community user for about four years i'm only joined the company about a year and half ago and it just love Department I felt like I said it it's addictive to be

able to do things in graph I was a sequel developer for years and that's a lot worse but really i rep a blog post or two and then i will present the blackboard and explaining you know how was done and get more detailed answer people's questions and then people have their own ideas of what they want to do the graph i'll show how they could do it or you know it's really about the

audience whatever they want what do they need they have access to ask questions and learn something from it yeah and so the format you know you said you started the group is you are already passionate about neo4j and then you've been writing blog posts and like you kind of like come up with an idea for a presentation and you write it up and then do the talk at the user group yeah pretty much I

mean the ideas come from customer work we do and also from just random people you will me how I do this in the graph right and sometimes easy to just build it and to tell them how do we do it right now you know nothing speaks louder than code so about the show music oh yeah i'm going to how to connect to facebook well here's ago to do not just theoretically

how to do it to it yeah then do you ever have anybody come in from outside and do presentations or is mostly just your you're fielding these these these requests to these questions we have a few our customers in the area and sometimes are common and talking to show you what they've done okay mom but a lot of times it's hard because the infra do stuff seems to be secret sauce for a lot

of people so they can really show us right very subtly doing but you know a lot of times really just me i wish i had hahaha helping me out i wish there were more open source projects in chicago doing it so that they could help me now but there's always something through said i can talk about graphs wherever so yeah and you know we talked a little bit before the conversation this

conversation about the resume example of a meet-up meetups app that was looking at some of the analytics and statistics around user user group meetings what do you know anything about that sure it's something one of my colleagues built and i think he's going to expand it out but the general idea is you can see how people are you know they belong to a group they also blogged many other

groups they're related through that they're also interest that these coops are about and whether they're about Big Data there but no seat over there about Java whatever they are they're about can connect groups having clinic people that way and you can expand it for the rap like if you wanted to see what other groups and other cities i may want to go visit based on my current and the

current likes something else you can do connect products to people through it as well same thing you have the trick to the graph really is if you have two points that you want to connect together through some common language whether it's you know send me the group's same companies and products same whatever it is you can do it through the relationships on the graph I'm just

coming through and fighting pass from one point to the other okay and as this is up on github or is this a a website you know it's both it's on it's the website I don't have to you're all my head but it's it's usually just fine man you every day and lead up and you'll find it everything we do is open source so it should be up there sours a repo line I mean an organization on

github yeah thurs in year 4 j there's a neo-con trib there's neyo community there's that we have like a whole bunch everything is going to get up you can see the guys latest commit on on you every day that / me every day you can see what the team worked on yesterday night it's kind of nice right you can see exactly what we're doing every single day and you know the bug fixes

that come in the pull requests that come in it's all right there okay well thank you very much for digging the price raised me Horace thanks user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm you

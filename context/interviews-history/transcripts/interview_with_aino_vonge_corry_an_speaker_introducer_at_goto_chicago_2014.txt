hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at go to con 2014 i'm sending your final cory founder of meta developer and she is here doing introductions for further speakers for several of the presentations thank you very much for taking a time to speak with me so your relationship with with go to town pottage end up coming here and doing these introductions and the opening warm

up for these speakers well there was a long way leading to that so it all started in in denmark in the daily kingdom on the northern europe where there was a company called the trifle we wanted to go to a lot of conferences in the u.s. to see a lot of the great speakers but they couldn't afford it so what they decided to do instead was to create their own conference at n log

right so it started there in Denmark in 96 and in 98 it had grown to become a bit larger and at that time I just started my PhD in computer science and I was working with programming languages and design patterns and correspondence between those two and they invited me as a PhD student in their PhD track to talk about what I was going to do what I was planning to do so you came in as the

presenter yes that was your way I started I was yeah in a special track for PhD students or not not on the tracks what we have Martin Fowler and dis humble but it was real stuff no not like that i read that i was not a professional speaker than that so I prigioni was the very good speaker that time anyway so I finished my PhD and i started doing teaching at university and

also in industry trifle and then they offered me a job after my PhD so i started working from memory in 2001 and one of my first tasks was to do a tutorial about software architecture for for the conference and also to help out inviting some of the speakers so over the years i've been working on and off with try fog and university but all the time I've been helping out with the

conference in Denmark in writing speakers and now I become the PC chair for many of the of the conference and said we do because now it's not all me in markets in here in Chicago I'm also involved in a gal conference in Australia q con London through all over a to believe Amsterdam yes yeah that's that's a lot of model flying it's a lot of flying yes but it's very interesting

to be part of the program committee because you you get the chance to to spend some time and get one of the trends and sealer talks and who the good speakers we could talk about this talk about that so preferably of course we want speakers who's done something special so that their name is well known or or the brand at least it's well known but also that they are really really

good speakers entertaining and can make people listen to what they're saying and actually also on the third part we'd like them to be great people to be around because we like our conferences to be a cozy airport yeah so sure where the participants in the speakers can communicate with each other that's also why we do not have a speaker room we do not want to hide them away from where

the participants yeah so is the ideas there everybody's out and mingling and meeting yeah exactly but to do the presentations you said you started off as a PhD we're just say you were a student when you first came yet yes sir when you were PhD student doing a presentation now you're doing warm-ups for pretty and introducing which as you describe you want people that are

friendly while you you kind of want somebody to be a little bit funny to do one up see how did you go from being this uncomfortable person may be a little bit doing the first talk to you now loving to be in today I'm not going to be as agent and now having a little bit of a performance yeah I'd know it came a little after little I remember the first really big presentation i gave

was at the upsilon conference in 98 one of the papers i had accepted and there I was so nervous and I I rehearsed it so many times but now I it's more natural to me I know basically what i want to say and then when i get on stage at sometimes say something completely different but i just enjoy beer so now if practice we are something like a message did you do any drama or anything

when you were in school no just once you get bit by the bug yes he was I've always been a child never wanted to have any attention when I was a child and now I love it and you know actually it's interesting i talked with some people who when they go on the stage they're very gregarious and open kind of like a bob martin mal kabob and then wonder offstage we love them

more reserved and and soft-spoken or maybe not necessarily so I know but but so the point is is that when you get out of stage very good to put on personas and I'm going to come back they're able to be e themselves again is that something you do or do you feel our like your your your personality onstage is it's the same as off stage or is it melted I definitely think that there's a

change that's also why sometimes I don't really know what I'm going to say when I'm on stage and because I sort of change into somebody wants to be then have attention and when I come down from the stage again I'm just myself yeah this is it feel like kind of exhilarating or a little bit like oh that was depleting no I'm hi about an hour after I've been in today are and

then I deflate and then it's Oh Gladys tired yes right I think I use a lot of energy on it okay and so the presentations here go to come out which ones which who are you introducing so in the morning introductions I just share with Dave Thomas I to use half of them and he introduces the other half of them and now I'm track hosting also for some of the sessions like this afternoon and

track posting for instance quick break young and is there strike hosting for my fly guard and many shoe just humble so but what is what is track hosting oh that means that you are hosting a track in the room so all the speakers that are coming they're sort of your responsibilities you need to make sure that they're there you need to introduce them so they know when to start talking

and you need to help them stop talking when they do I stop talking and you get their slides for the website illness so it's a little bit of an embassy kind of it is so MC I know yes well thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me I really appreciate it thank you hello actually you know what I do want to ask one more thing okay is there a for somebody who's looking at presenting

and maybe coming to their first big conference because you've experienced going from coming into a big conference is there any particular advisor or any thought you might think of that they might not be prepared for or maybe are overly prepared for anything that you know when you do mean when you are accepted to go yeah like when you're going to go to a talk at a big

conference so that you know 100 over well over a hundred people enter or multi-day track and it's it's going to be a bigger conference you know there there's water maybe of us with any questions what are some things that they should be prepared for and what if anything is that they might be thinking that they're used to at a smaller venue that they okay that won't translate well

into a larger venue okay say it's a hard question yeah but I could say that one thing you said sometimes you get shocked by the number of people and you get nervous and the thing that really works for me is to rehearse at least the first three sentences so that I know them by heart really by heart you know rehearsing reverting reversing so that even if I get very nervous when I get on

stage I sort of I've got it down to and automation and once you've started talking normally you forget how many people that are there so that that first moment the first moment is very important caution ship rehearse your whole presentation but that first moment is really important that you really say out loud many times and also if people are asking you a question from the

audience you have to remember to repeat the question of course so there everybody knows that you've understood the question correctly and everybody has heard the question right so that would be one of the things ok and then don't listen to all the bad Chris yeah try to turn it off yeah okay well not for real thank you very much that was practice on the first time I thank you very much for

taking the time to speak with me you're welcome user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech munity fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm you you

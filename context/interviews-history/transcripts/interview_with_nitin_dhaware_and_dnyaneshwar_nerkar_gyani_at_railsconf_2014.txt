hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at walls comp 2014 men now i'm with my and stunts who talked about empowering rich internet applications are i ace with accessibility thank you very much for taking the time to to send you're on top of me we should behave you everything to the things i do what what what was the talk about then you can go ahead I mean it was kind of in the title but what was

the point yeah the dog was about empowering each internet applications with accessibility as you have said rich internet applications are the applications which gives you feel like desktop applications it has rich widgets okay which give you feel exactly like the rest of applications what holds our talk about is empowering these rich internet applications no max ability

perspective now what accessibility is we are here specifically referring about a web accessibility period so according to United Nations fifteen percent of the global population is having some kind of disability so the paper contained in the reach Internet application is not easily accessible for them even so if we want to make it accessible then we need to know certain accessibility compliances

I'm straight about our log yeah exactly like that who would again he said as when there is rich Internet applications there is a lot of dynamic content that is president of it right so there is charge of that comes into picture and all of the components the fun with many bars and the accordions and the tab panels all these widgets which are completely power with JavaScript finally

for for screen reading software or assistive technologies that are used by this huge crowd of fifteen percent fifteen percent is not small it's almost like one with people here and that's a huge number of people who might be such technologies and for them it's like to make all these dynamic applications make them feel the same way as a scientist I person move wood and so that

for that we need to our ads and natural beauty or certain rules or certain dynamic code snippets so that it can be accessible right and it's not only about serving the disabled community and which is like fifteen percent but your shorts or books provider group because the general person is disabled at some given for offline right Anders it was a gamut I mean as you could see you guys have

reduced or no vision so your experience from the web even by I have vision is radically different but there's also people that have different color color entire nation right now sees people just don't realize then Delia use my CC which comes with the aging as well the results woman kind of disability which is dyslexia and people who cannot actually try and like they can understand things

but to read and sign becomes challenge so even there the way you text should be former rather content should be presented that the first so there are a lot of cognitive as well as vision as well as hearing a lot of tedious to it but it's not either grain just that it's not about just disability for shin so when you're talking about web frameworks it was a specific framework you were

discussing or was it just generally these are things that all frames should be doing yeah actually I agree yeah he was discussing about Reds but this is this topic can be applied to other framework as well actually this is a very general public to be honest the web accessibility has to be implemented across the brain works but since its arrays conference so the demonstration

that we showed in the dock where explicitly for the race course ingots ok so the intention behind coming here and delivering a speech was up spreading that awareness within this risk UD so that the risk or itself can be made accessible Andres can put forth an example before the wave world that yes this is the way of rember can be there a supply chain well I can understand the

fun and frameworks you know we're definitely improving but what was something maybe that because I always think of rails more about the back end I don't think too much like that even though it's a web framework and it generates HTML that's kind of a secondary function for firms in my perspective but what was something though that was specifically rails that

would have been yeah now if you'll answer that you know there are generators if you use in rates right from generators simple form and things like that which are always used for the UF side or this bootstrapping that is used and Amelia because it's a web framework and although there is lot of things that are made easier on the back end ultimately you your application is

going to be rendered to the browser right so that's going to come into picture lv eventually so that part of the reason is something that we went pregnant fluence or we were trying to convince people that that can be place where we can start cooking it when you say form for a field then that friend is generated along with its label just from single function cos hear you talk more

about those generators that come with why all the yeah yeah they use good standards by the chances they use standards by default but we can actually add some more aspects to it or override certain aspects so that we also generate more accessible widgets oh yeah the UI components by default and morning we happen to talk with one of the rails core members and we had discussion with

him that we can together work in we can risk or its of accessible so that when we reach the next risk aversion if you should come with accessibility implemented embedded into it this way of a thing together or the conference coming at these houses it isn't just talking you know about ideas at section changing got 10 community section so it just seemed to

ask and I've heard here are burned up burn Hogan does a wrote a book about accessibility guidelines i came up with exact title the river service book about web accessibility and I he's talked about this topic before and I know he's mentioned different front-end frameworks that like angular and an ember which one if if I'm a developer and I'm looking at building a single page app what one

right now do you recommend kind of visitor a specific angular or amber or the ton of noise let me do that the most to the great one be a peasant does all the tabs and all that pattern during single page and radically change right right so there is one by what's up omwh ps4 seeking that is a framework that but that's purely a JavaScript framework right EXO but if you want to have some

CMS and the content and all that we manage behind it that would need certain integration and lot of coated so you have been using certain widgets out of those watch on comm api's which is published by Brian Araminta SSB Bart and that's that's a client-side framework which can be used to develop to one page a single page have apps in fact wats Ofcom the site itself is a single

patient so the site somebody who's trying to understand what could good implementation in half of an accessible framework look like in the canopy is at four exit from 680 as a reference weekend okay well thank you very much for taking the time to our the speaker may appreciate nice looking thank you thank you my stuffing Hank likewise each user groups

user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's Mike again with you tastic I'm still here at web visions 2014 at the gene siskel film center in chicago right now i'm sitting down with Brandon Emily

who's speaking today about choice and how choice can affect our designs I thank you for giving the kind of Stella no she's um so do you want to take a choice and choose to describe what your talk is about sure it is the lamest joke of the day hey I got a chuckle that's like an Esquimaux interesting choice were looking about my interest in attention and how attention works from a

physiology room as well as a psychology kind of stand for I really is you know retention puts a huge factor in how we make decisions and how we make choices I gave a talk about that a couple times actually talked to Gabe at target web position to Portland months ago and about halfway through the talk in my head this talk is not about attention right so it's about choices and so I

said well I'm gonna blow this up but I'm doing this I'll finish this out right now but I'm last song giving this talk and so I doing away blew it up took it apart and did some more research figuring out okay what are the other aspects of choice what plays a factor in choice and in addition to attention it turned out it was environment and effort right those like the right now at least

in my stage of research and learning inside those are the three main factors and I'm hiding obviously those have sub backers and there's you can go into detail in each one specifically but to the most part that's those are three a kind of tease the audience a little bit by saying you know just choices simple because it's just these three things yeah those three things are really hard

though oh yeah right so we know it was just a just good day Oh throttle them have a few cocktails and you're good um so at did deep dive in each of those three areas and gave some examples and had some fun made some jokes hopefully people at fun so whenever somebody talks about choice i always think about robin williams and they're seen in this eighties movie

replay the russian i can t the word but he leads to do from Russia when they would escape to America and they would take asylum and he played this discussion Soviets era person who lose in in in a grocery store in summer New York but he's trying to pick our coffee he walks up to the front counter its excuse me where's the line for coffee just are like coffee it's cooking to

coffee and Williams character goes over to the coffee section and he looks this is folgers tasters choice this this this friend of coffee then he looks then finally he's running back and forth between all these choices of coffee it just has a big screen nervous breakdown this coffee he passes out that's it's a great metaphor for where we are in the world of digital and technology an

example I use is over the last 10-15 years we kind of went through this like convergent model where all these different things converged into a single device which is our now our smart phones you know our pages or cell phones or planners right or contact list but uh whatever you can think of yet now we're diverging from we're getting google glass and other you know devices like

that we're getting smart watches iPads and iPad soon so we had this nice like all it's getting so much simpler because I just need this one thing and now I'm the guy that walks around with two iPads and I don't want to be that guy but I emeka right and so even then it's like which ipad should i use right now and it's based on in my context and and what i'm trying to do but but yeah it's two

things just get more more complicated and that's why I think choice is so interesting and important because it is doing more complicated and if we can understand how people make choices and why and we all the things that go into it we can design butter stuff because that's what we want to do anyways oh you know about the attention and getting distracted and just getting overwhelmed

with choices I wonder how whether your talk for research that about just general distractions or is it been about more the psychology of distraction it's a combination of psychology but also neuroscience so when I'm talking about attention because attention environment are very closely linked to each other I kind of leave a lot of the intention

aspects of environment to talk about environment I talk about these two concepts that are present inside of psychology and neural neuroscience called change blindness and selective attention so change blindness is when something changes on you they learn you should don't notice the example I use is you're talking to a stranger they're asking for directions a distraction

occurs they there when you come back to it it's a completely different person that's now asking you questions and you don't even notice it and showed a little cute little video that actually illustrates it and then selective attention is one where you're giving construction or you're going to order your room your attention immediately televisions and everything else does

matter so if you get an email and it says go look at our new wallets you go to their website and you kind of see all this noise you don't you literally do not see that other stuff because I've been told to look for wallets and if you don't look don't see any wallets there's a hiccup and confused is that kind of like the one there was a video where there was a bunch of people dancing and

bobbing around a gym gymnastics and a monkey soon well that's that's the occasionally that's the example I use for selective attention side note you know the research for that the research for the change blindness occurred here in Chicago alone it's a school of psychology at one of the universities around here because one of the people that when I start to look for the monkey

I don't see that that the answers and I'm looking at the dancers not aware of the monkey I don't see what ya see this is there's something that goes on in your brain where some of those outside of your control says that's not important so you don't need to see it they've done similar research when it comes to bikers so I know like Chicago is a really bike you know biker city a

little more becoming worse yet but New York necessarily isn't and so what they found is you know bikers tend to get hit more in or can they do in chicago and it's because in chicago your you expect to see bikers and so as part of that unsub conscious view of the world that you're looking for bikers and the subconscious you know makes you make certain

decisions so it gets into your mental checklist and rice to where whereas in New York not so much and so you don't expect the biker to be there and you hit them that's one reason why tsa fails so often when they do you know they put fake bombs to the exercises like that is people are looking at those x-rays day in day out they expect to see the you know three four or five things you know

the laptop the ipad that the cosmetic bags other kind stuff and they don't expect to see those things they literally don't it's not necessarily they're not doing their job it's just because they're humans and they've been biggest have an established pattern and they don't yeah there's examples of examples I can go on about about that but and just what you put enough in this

interesting is up after this interview is getting to touch with lots of different communities there is some people who are speaking out about psychological issues for developers and people in the tech industry how great bulges above is I'm sorry mangling your name um is worrying about depression at MTG HD at finkler is also talked about mental issues is some of what you're

doing more like focus on a normal brain yes psychology or beach do you know it's too mostly normal people um its terms I'm a designer Mayo's designer so I consider myself an edge case and it we're taught and us to ignore the edge cases so I always see these designers and select this edge cases like what's going on like with iOS 7 meter nice there's a lot of people complain about

it they tend to be designers um my mom she's fine yeah my grandpa he's 86 he's fine no those are the people that really matter and and those are want to go over now let's not demean the people that have disorders like that they don't matter they do and especially if you're designing for them I've done research with cancer patients and caregivers and one of the things that we learned

where we're researching them and then subsequently because I name for them was there's this like just mental fatigue that occurs battling with any type of ailments all right and so if you start presenting stuff with them effort becomes really important because they're very tired not just physically but they know cognitively right and and without that insight makes makes the interface

harder for them to use even though you think you're doing our job yeah and that good evening that's fresh I mean thinking about how just the emotional fatigue of dealing with this issue Oh a plan and even with poverty I've read not too long ago about hotel how expensive poverty and it's that there's the concept of of sounds counterintuitive but they're right but is it said it's

the it's the choice between or decision fatigue where do I pay the bill or do I feed my kids do I you know do I have heat or do I have food and then trying to go beyond those choices credibly it's one reason why my mother always said the her grandmother was a source of inspiration for because so so sorry okay um my mother was my mother said that her grandmother was such an inspiration for

her my grandmother you know had eight kids during the Great Depression and before i think is late and that shows you how much i my my my my but uh it was a lot of kids and the when the last one was born her husband died again in a car accident was killed so he had to go through the Great Depression feeding kids eight kids potentially okay uh and shall I she's good I like she's she

survived yeah and the family didn't break apart she raised seven healthy great people that went on to help bring me into the world of instrument and yeah it's one where we are capable of doing some amazing things if we have to but um luckily or not lucky kinda depends on how you work it we live in a world where you don't have to make tough decisions apply Tanya even what do they say even

our most poor are so richer than you know good chunk of the world right and then you know that's the sounds kind of counter to to begin where you don't want to like make light of that issue but it's there and it's data so it's not like you know it's a story and yeah it's just we look very different times and so yeah well thank you very much things I'm stumped I appreciate it yeah thanks for

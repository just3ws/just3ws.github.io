hi it's mike with you tastic just let I take a few minutes here before I get started interviewing today it's the last day of railsconf 2014 and I just kind of wanted to share some of what i've been using to capture and coordinate interviews the railsconf organizers they've given me a very nice room it's a storage and meeting room that I'm able to set up my little camera and I'll show

you right here this is a hero 3 excuse me the GoPro Hero 3 plus it was about 300 bucks saw but then I also bought an external mount which let me have no guard around around the front of it you see this little blinking light what that is is it's connected via Wi-Fi it's got its own of a private network so i can see the what's in the ER camera viewfinder which is very nice or i

should say what the camera is actually capturing so when I'm standing here doing the interviews you might see that I'll have this in my hand what that lets me do is it lets me frame the actual shot so i can actually see what's going on and i can hit the little i can't hit it right now but i can hit the little start and stop button and then there's a little preview window will let me see

how the video turned out and I can actually then press play I could see my last interview with Alexander Dima this morning I could play it right now I'm not going to do that because it's kind of loud but basically having this camera set up gives me a lot of flexibility because I operate the camera myself when I'm doing the interviews one little hiccup with the GoPro 3 is that I have

an external microphone I have to have it plugged in to a USB cable right now it's charging between interviews but I have an external zoom microphone that lets me have focus on the two front channels so that way I can capture the best audio I can hear sometimes when I'm out on the the floor of a conference you'll see some of the interviews there was an event booked in here during that time

where I had to go out on the floor and it does a pretty good job considering how noisy the rooms actually were a little little battery charger and I can show you my my my rats now stuff of stuff that i have that some of that's just back up son and other things that I I keep for the interviews and as far as scheduling at the day of the conference I try to do some online scheduling

before the conference but you know usually that's that's fickle at the best but what I do is a lot of scheduling on the day of the event so each day I'm running around these were notes from the DHH interview then I was these were questions I wanted to have so that way I'd be ready to talk with him this was from day two and here's day one I must have left a pub they ones on the back of

one of these but each one of these represents the scheduling and as I move through the day I mark off each each interview and I I do kind of a funny thing where I sometimes like to reschedule people or I might not have a firm commitment for them so I will break it off for that slot because I might not know whether matt they're going to actually because I might have tweeted at

them and said hey can you do this time but then again I don't want to go to another person until I've heard back saying yes I can do it or no I can't so I just have this little notation so you can see here this one's a preliminary schedule that I had where I just knew that I wanted to talk to somebody in the morning or in the afternoon so this was kind of a rough draft of a schedule and

this is a rough draft of today's schedule which is you can see quite a few interviews so far i have about 25 interview that I've captured and after today it's going to be well over 30 maybe even approaching 40 I haven't counted try not to count but you know it's it's it's been a very busy conference I really appreciate the support that I've gotten

from the organizers I've Evan Phoenix and Shirley and Abby that they've been ah they've been very great in giving me this very nice very quiet room appreciate it and a nice place to plug in and also to the organized I'm excuse me to the speaker's who've been very patient with me at times when we had to reschedule because of just timing of sessions and and all kinds of other

things that come up so again thank you very much I've had a great time interviewing here at railsconf 2014 and hope to get these out to you soon thanks bye

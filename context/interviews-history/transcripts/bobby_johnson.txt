hi I'm Mike I'm sitting here with Bobby Johnson from the south sound on that users group hi Bobby thinks we're both standing up with me right now yeah no problem were your results sitting down but not you know can you tell her a little a little bit about your user group in what you guys do sure actually not sure where South Sound is yeah South Sound refers to the cell Puget Sound ok

let's work out 45 miles south of olympia washington ok and our user group meets every second thursday of the month so you're two times one someone also every second every seconds happy n ty it's been a long day yeah numbers where it's difficult but ok so every second every second thursday of the month we we get together and we typically have a presenter come down and that's wrong

responsible course i usually booked the presenters ok and we have anywhere from 10 to 25 local net developers olympia happens to be the capital of our state's if there's a lot of state agencies that do not met development okay so that's mainly what are our audience consists of these is state buildings what do you say book book speakers okay are you are you reaching out to you the microsoft

sometimes sometimes i reach out to the local dev community i'm pretty involved with the seattle up on that group as well which some of the more high-level dotnet developers have been involved in that community so I kind of cherry review those guys yeah exactly okay and so like seven sub not not too familiar with south side i'm not sure what kind of metropolitan area that needs to step

brother sentence a capital Washington so which means i need to go back to fifth grade ah but ah is I saw it's a pretty decent sized areas that he took me to give 52 anywhere from 15 to 25 to 50 to 25 people so it's a pretty good representation are they are they do typically did with people oh these are we have a core group of members that show up that

meeting and then kind of a rooming band of thousands I'll kind of show up whenever they show do you know when you say thousand you mean you have a pretty large registered member base yeah we've our mailing list to something like 500 email addresses a lot how many of those are actually live accounts that actually go to somebody so so the typically like if you said you're poking speakers I'm

assuming that you're typically doing a presentation style yeah okay do you ever do any hands on my abs road oh we do I attempted to do a randori style tdd session where basically we had one person guiding somebody at a keyboard and every two minutes we'd switch off and we worked our way through the string calculator those things are kind of rare for for our user group it's typically

presentations in and you know you said that you kind of can terrific and beyond that group as as being so close to an alternate group which can be able to kind of unique perspective on user groups themselves is that if affected by cancer on chart says is the user room featuring of it's more of a poor Microsoft edge of it lets me focus on water the current Microsoft technologies

said it's a safe assumption I would say the the overall feel the user group is is more pragmatic Microsoft developers so that you know they're probably using still using down at 35 or earlier right but the content we try to bring down is introducing the new stuff coming out okay so we're trying to keep them current and encourage them to try to French up and try the new things and and

also since you're since you're still working closer towards platform not saying okay that holds on that guides our opponent often would do something off away from the mothership we sure do you have some help from the developer evangelist to a Microsoft via then they will definitely provide a software swag like that or even if this up with maybe developers in

working groups that we were interested in here present is wrong that's it'll be pretty nice it is really nice being so close to the microsoft campus it's a curse too but being that close we have a steady stream of a really qualified most fears what's the curse what's the downside well the the curses you we get a lot of practice speakers so yeah I'll come down and speak at your your user

group but what I'm really doing is I'm just greeting my slides to you getting a feel for when I go off to ya to the bigger conferences and stuff like that ok well yeah it's it's a it's a plus or minus hours not that these are groups were good test back yeah or speakers but maybe if you're like being like guinea pig laugh or for Microsoft that might be a little awkward um did you leverage

anything I think I know that microsoft offers some and i've taken advantage to myself user group support services I'm add up and those we've been able to take advantage of those yeah the main leader of our user group is the regional Iannetta I forget what they call my sponsor or something like that and we have used Iannetta funds before to get speakers to our location so i pay for

gas and maybe lodging the runs so we have taken advantage but has been yeah good alright well thank you very much Bobby for talking with me about the South South Dallas users basalt solid on that users group in Washington thank you very much

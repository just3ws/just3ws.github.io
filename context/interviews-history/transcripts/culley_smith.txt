hi I'm like with you tastic i'm here at SCA again i'm sitting down with kelly smith who has run a user group on the university of wisconsin on campus and he had an interesting perspective on the needs of a student's user group versus those of some of us who are out in the professional world where we tipard you typically consider the attendings of a user group so thanks for sitting down

what what was it that was unique about running a user group for students than when he came out of college yeah come unimed wailers well what it was your experience yeah so the the users group was geared toward not only students but also professionals on campus Oh in madison wisconsin we have mad railers which is an established users group and it meets on mondays evenings the first

perspective that we were trying to offer as a matter of group as well as a lot other users groups it's geared towards startup companies towards enterprises things like that but the campus has specific needs a lot of times they're dealing with not new products but they're dealing with how to write software with existing things in place so trying to come in and change the

culture to be more agile to be more lean was simply not feasible it was out of their control of a start-up or a business you might get some headway and doing that or if you have a small department but quite often on campus you didn't even have a department you had one individual working on a codebase right so what we were trying to do was create a resource for the campus to use

to say these are some of the products that are being developed across the campus and where are some ways that we can consolidate our efforts and do some knowledge sharing because if someone else is building an application very similar inside the department of medicine to something that someone else is doing in the Department of Communications and those people don't

have a way to talk a central location to me a lot of times just wasted efforts so instead of just having a newsletter it's okay let's get everybody together casual let's talk about this cool stuff and then let it naturally let them talk and get to know each other and I lost control less structured environments you're not in a meeting you're a user group yeah we started off

with just a mailing list we were using a mailing list and we found that there was there were some topics that just did not translate well to discussion into mailing list and we wanted and people also wanted an opportunity to learn they wanted to go in and see someone present on test-driven development but not under the preconceived notion that it was going to be something that you were

going to be able to implement but just what are some of the ways that we can start doing test-driven development and also on campus even though this was a ruby on rails meetup group we were opening it up to people that were from coming from different backgrounds from Java from.net from other things and so it was sort of language so even though you were underneath the label of a real

ruby was hey whoever's cool whoever wants to come in and learn about these things these concepts not mr. rail the concepts that are popular around good news they were all wanting to come in yeah so then you get some people like that quite a few people came in just they're doing JavaScript stuff okay so on campuses mobile is a very big concern right now my name thanks for mobile apps

because students are walking around with phones with tablets from class to class and so you could either be doing iOS or Android or something for for native apps but a lot of people were building their apps and then just having like a JavaScript framework like PhoneGap or something like that so that they could wrap it so we had quite a few people that were interested in using

test-driven development and agile approaches to the JavaScript side so when you came out of college and he moved out and you were moved on from the from from the school university environment out into a professional environments why we should say were you i should say actually where your students university was actually an employee oh you were an employee okay

and you would put you're trying to reach out to new students students and we were trying to expose students because that was one of the things that we had learned that a lot of students that were going through a traditional computer science program weren't exposed to things like test driven development like agile and things like that they were learning data

structures they were learning things like that but they weren't understanding how that was going to be implemented in the massive community has a number of startup companies they have been d works such as our consulting to shop and a number of other software consulting company or stuffer startup companies that were wanting to hire people but there was a huge gap between what the

students were actually learning at school and how they're going to be asked to practice it so yeah we did reach out to students just to say well this is what pair programming is this is what agile is this is what tested and development yeah they're like throwing the learning data structure in schema and root and Java movie and then coming out and having to figure out how to

write up an application yeah it's a big gap yeah so but when you came out of working in the university environment sin to the more traditional business startup culture what what kind of became of the user group on the campus it we needed someone to come in and take over and support it I think that there are still efforts to get it going but the problem I think is if you don't have

someone that you know has the vision to get it done it's so it's still sitting there and at this time it's made mainly just a practical matter I don't have the same permissions to book rooms on a campus so even though I still would have a great interest in doing so I would meet someone on campus so it's more of a bureaucracy rabea kind of holding me back yes okay well thank you very much

for taking the time to sit down make sure you

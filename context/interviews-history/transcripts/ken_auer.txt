hi it's mike with you tastic again today I'm sitting down with Ken our ken has been a speaker on the object-oriented commute in the obscurity community for a very long time and I first heard him talk at SCA 2009 where he talked a little bit about how he got into a speaking and teaching and eventually mentoring through a waddle software it with the object already community so

also he's a devout religious person Christian and care is that faith into his teachings and his work through role model software so we'll talk a little bit about how it got involved with with teaching how role model software came to be and what some of his experiences have been with sharing his faith as part of his his life and his teaching so ken thank you very much for taking the time

to sit down with me today glad to be here so in 2009 I was attending I think it was the first SCA conference and I got a chance to hear you talk and my recollection wasn't perfect I thought you had been inspired by some presentations you had heard by some some of the people who were starting that the concepts of Allah or promoting oh but you corrected me to say that you had

already been working with hole so can you tell me a little bit about how you got started in in what their what the real story was sure yeah the kind of interesting i was hired by company called paradigm which some people may have heard of they actually invented dsl but that not back when i was working with them but they were they hired me to help build the next network management

system and wealthy that the writing guys yeah sorry you might TS although the the Internet communication yeah yeah glee way back then they were just dealing with high speed modems but they wanted to build the next generation network management system and so I was there with a bunch of experienced developers and I was and we were all trying to figure out how do we

build this and see and this was a time when workstations like son work stations were just getting off the ground tektronix HP digital a couple of these guys had workstations and we're just exploring what technology we could use we were wanted something called a graphical user interface the term GUI wasn't invented yet it realizes the 80s and the Mac it just came out and so one

of the marketing guys actually had read one of the three articles written about object-oriented programming at the time and he said you know you guys really should be looking into object-oriented programming when I'm sorry I should have muted this sorry no problem can I did this I can I can't I hate that I might be there that really stinks okay so out of that out anywhere the he'd been one

of the three articles on entrepreneur program you said you guys need to be looking at that we all look at each other and said what's object choreographing so we went read the three articles that were written on it and said this sounds pretty cool we should look into this and we were a bunch of computer science grads most of us while students and most of the some of us were

others had gotten to engineering programming or other means and we had never heard of this thing and we started setting it looking into it found out the small talk ran on some of these workstations that we were looking at and next thing you know we were learning about it from the guys at stepstone which were actually inventors of objective-c because they believed that

small talk could never be used in a commercial environment we proved them wrong but we eventually started using objective-c and small talk and it was kind of interesting so as I'm doing this I'm pretty new 2324 getting my masters at night and learning about object or and technology in the in my day job going to these masters programs at night and seeing the academics talking about

the stuff that I'm supposedly need to know to be successful in my career and they introduce arbitrary and technology in a very academic way that had nothing to do with the objects we were dealing with and I finally said you know what I'm going to stop listening to the academics and just pour my time into understanding this technology which they don't seem to understand till that I

know the first oopsla conference was just being formed the same year I just learned about objects and Oopsah was op aquarium programming systems and languages and it's got combination of academics and people trying to apply this application right and yeah I very quickly got to meet the people who written the three books on small talk you know the folks for out of Xerox PARC

met guys like Kent Beck and ward cunningham who were doing work out of tektronix and a few other guys and in a lot of academics and and I very quickly understood that first of all most of academics I just gotten my you know degree and how I've never heard of it most decade that makes didn't hear that either it wasn't relevant and in the academics that where they're talking

about objects it's like this just doesn't make sense I do this every day and what you're saying is so irrelevant yeah they're talking about correct programs i'm thinking correct programs is when people use it is helpful you know it's not a mathematical formula here guys yeah oh my so very quickly whenever yeah so very quickly got drawn to started participating workshops at

Upsala and talk about this concept of object-oriented design you know he had a degree program you know we'd ever heard of auba career in design and you know got into workshops and started talking to guys like Kent backed in Ward Cunningham and back in 1987 I pulled up this not too long ago a paper that Canton Ward road in 1987 about patterns in programming languages and how

patterns can help us and you know for years we started talking about patterns years later we were you know talking about rolling this out to the rest of the world and the patterns book started coming out and eventually things like extreme programming all this came out of applying this so a lot of that gets into how I started teaching people because

you could I look good yet yet this room's college yeah people were taking these very interesting topics that and making them dull and and you were looking at like how can you convert this to something to be more consumable right and then you know Spanish other other than guys like well you know can't had a computer science degree but board had a no ee or something and the more people i

met in this community that were people that were really doing great stuff the more i realize how many didn't have a computer science degree we're working with the pic i want time he did they're pretty cool and it's that's pretty nice not bad for a history major isn't and you know started recognizing that most of the best developers that I'd run into had had mentors you know somebody just

helped him along and they just really wanted to take the technology and apply it and yeah started realizing well if this is the case and I mean although you know my computer science degree I certainly don't want to say it had no value it certainly did got me my first job but I was recognizing that you know if I want to help people learn how to do I bikkuri in programming it's a whole

paradigm shift maintain their teaching in universities they're almost teaching it backwards they teach performance first instead of you know the mantra we came up with you know can't and I and a couple others make it run make it right make it fast you know performance comes last once you've got this thing down nice and clean then you know if there's any performance left to tune out of it

then you tune it people were being taught this so I found that you know I'm constantly as I'm working with my clients I got into popular and consulting for small company called knowledge systems in the late 80s and it just grew as small talk and other things started growing and constantly trying to teach people how this was different than the way they thought before you know

introducing gooeys and objects and stuff that was all brain new to most people found that boy you know having computer science degree often got in the way sometimes it didn't you know it depend on whether people can make the jumps but I just found that mentoring was the most important thing and immersion you know just learning by doing it having somebody who's done it

around you you know my mentors were were the guys who wrote the small talk library you know I spent all that time reading the code because it was the only optical encode planet ya know so it out to that one and then they kind of took you under their wing to help you to learn or did you serve did you I guess I should speak into the microphone so you were looking for a mentor and you were

able to find a mentor in them is that a correct assessment of how that worked or did you welcome it quickly became you know again we were I mean recognize we were we were the Pioneer so we go to the first suits there was 600 people you know and probably three or four hundred of them were academics right you know I found out that you know at the at the ripe old age of 25 with a couple years

under my belt that I was I had more experience in building under green systems and most people on the planet and certainly looking for mentors but there wasn't a whole lot of shoes from okay so you know definitely meeting meeting Kent and ward and you know we kind of in many ways became our own mentors and we just share experiences if here's what I tried how'd that work you

know and we were describing different patterns that showed up in the Gang of Four book you know eight years later we didn't have a name for him at the time but sure here's a night ride this thing and know who let somebody you know somewhere later I found out that I implemented the proxy pattern I didn't know that it had a name just seemed to make sense right so how did that

ultimately end up with you going into the the role of a mentor or how did you end up moving into working with somebody as a mentor how did how did that eventually culminate well when I was hired at knowledge systems I was working with the sam adams who probably had about a year's worth more experience and i did and yes sir and learned a lot from sam and we learned a lot from each other

was great to have a community of people and there's idea but very quickly it became clear that you know in order to hire more people into knowledge systems and do something about small talk there weren't a whole lot of people who had more than three years ago areas right so we just had to find somebody who at least had spelled it and and and used you know used it for

something right and bring him on actually the most interesting one was a net neta of oxen evar jakub sins daughter was just graduating college ebar was coming out with the idea of refactoring wanted to turn it in turn build a software product around it and felt like okay well I'll send my daughter to America she can explore America and asked if she could live at

knowledge systems and glean from us and then we just whenever we spent an hour with her teaching her just rack up a bill and he pay the bill yeah and I became an incredible experience because within three months now yet it was a very very bright individual but within three months we saw how much she learned by being in the environment of I'm trying to solve this problem here's what

I think here's the kind of stuff I need how would you do this and we spend time you know walking her through how we approach it then she'd do something and show it to us and your reviewer code and we watch that happen eventually we started having clients who said we need more of your time but we don't have a consulting budget right and our owner reed phillips had this great idea of

saying well how about we do what we did with a net to formalize it we called it the small talk apprenticeship program and it ended up saying it we take three people from a client team them up with one of our people and immerse them just you basically can locked in a large room with these people we build stuff together we talked through the principles and everything and that was

wildly successful we see people who came through that program in three months the Masters versus the guys are going back to it had a year experience and we just saw that this is the way it needs to be done you know immersion is is by far the best way to go they were getting what would otherwise take several years to get so nom and they get to pay it out of their education budget for these people

who didn't have any more consulting budgets would work out kind of good back then and you used you called it the apprenticeship program or it had the word apprenticeship in it door what was there any precedent in software for apprenticeship programs at that time or was this based off of of just taking a word that was seemed appropriate yeah

you know I never heard of anything like that before I know that a few people kind of duplicated it afterwards and I know when extreme programming came out Bob Barton had these XP immersion things that they went in several weeks and you just sit down with kenton about two other guy bit in a room and just do stuff XP way but I think as far as i know this multi furniture program was

really the first of its kind and then several people duplicated it and i'm quite honestly i don't know where they came you know who came up with the name we just said how do we having to do this package it up in a way that we can sell the people who are spending money out of their education budget because you had to have a program to do that right you had to have a course so you know we

called it a course but it really spanned spanned about 10 weeks about six weeks of emergent over ten weeks they get to go home and they drink from the firehose go him swallow a little bit come back yeah bring some more ass p yeah so fast forward a little bits to role model software and your founding that as i understand it's you've i'm from your original talk that I heard in 2009 that

you've actually integrated role model software into your home into your life that there's the business and the home all in one huh I can't think of it the right word but integrated integrated thank you a lifestyle so you have mentors come and they live in in a part of the house how does that work ya know it's confusing to me sometimes too not really I mean so actually I'm sitting in

our in a basement of our house we designed this but we started the company before before I designed this house with the vision of basically recognizing that this whole idea of mentorship and decided you mentioned my faith you know I was I was at the same time as I was learning how to be a better mentor and do more with software I was also being trained in church leadership in a very

intense kind of discipleship apprenticeship type of program and just started recognizing wow this is really neat and I had people going through the same thing with me to head seminary degrees and say man I never learned this stuff in seminary this is just going through you know the Bible and working with these men of God who've been leading churches and stuff and they were

saying what a great experience well so I just started seeing these patterns then you know I had a daughter and had to figure out how to educate her and I said started heard about homeschooling so I started learning about homeschooling and found out wow you know when you start homeschooling your whole model of Education changes drastically so all this was was happening with me in the

90s I didn't even know what's happened to me you know I just was you know their stumbled upon the idea of doing it software stumbled upon a church leadership and now I'm trying to raise my my own children and figure out how to educate them and just sort of seeing this pattern of wow you know when you actually live with people the more experience teaching the young less

experienced and actually doing stuff education happens in a very different way than our traditional sit in the classroom hear the lecture take the test and again not that there's no value for some of that you know in fact my daughter I just my daughter is not 21 and we sometimes speak it up homeschooling conferences and one of one of the reasons what we gave is the value

of a non academic education and point out that a well-rounded education isn't just theory but its application and they need to overlap because theory with that application is just head knowledge right application without understanding the foundations of it gets you to come in up with practices that you think are smart missing right so uh you know that's and that's kind of the way we do this here

so when I started role model was kind of again I was just learning about homeschooling I needed to hire my first employee because I had more work to do than I could and I couldn't afford a hot college graduate that wanted more money than they were worth because I knew that they're going to come out of college they don't know anything about objects right right you know I'm going to play

in fifty thousand dollars a year for the privilege of teaching them yeah I didn't think I wanted to do that have spent a few hours a week working on some assignments that have no deadlines except for its due for a grade just kidding right yeah and so I tried an experiment with a couple pretty bright I school guys and that didn't work out for a variety of reasons which we don't have

time to get into but then i eventually stumbled across this homeschool guy nathaniel Talbot who many people might know now who was looking for a mentor trying to avoid having you know his parents said look either got to find a way to get mentored get a career or go to college and he wanted a mentor and I wanted a mentee and I just worked out great so he came on board and you know

I'd give them assignments and he'd do some other odds and ends and empty the trash man can for me and whatever you know it just started working out and then after that after that worked out so well within about a year and a half Nathaniel was blowing away a lot of the people that I would work with the clines who had the computer science degrees and everything else granted the pain was a

new usual guy but uh guys who are hungry and want to learn they tend to make the best apprentices right so uh after doing that did another one in the next year and just kind of you know probably average about one a year sometimes we had more than one going and others but really found out you know we're trying to get work done here you can only have so much time we were teaching the guys

who don't know anything but eventually it doesn't take them that long till they start becoming the guys mentoring the next group of guys and now it's Cena more of an environment where the group is mentoring we do we did start a couple years ago the craftsmanship academy to kind of formalize the foundational park is what I'd find is the time out of time you need to pump into somebody for the

first three to six months was just a lot and just get the principles in there the theory that they never got right or the applied theory you never got and I know I've made this a immersion program a couple years ago to say the first the first few months there's going to be pretty intense but after that you know as soon as they've gotten that we teaching the principal teaching test

first development teach them a few other things how to build what good code looks like why you were your code don't just whip it together right you know a lot of stuff and then they just start working with with the teams yeah I thought it was very interesting how you were talking about once it were it sounded like you were saying that the once their apprentices reach a certain level they

could sort of kind of support each other and I've observed that in my past in martial arts and also in in my own little ones my kids are much much much younger than your kids but starting to see them number 7 year olds okay well I got a five and a two year old and seeing the five-year-old sit down now and sing the alphabet to the two-year-old and now that two-year-old is singing along with

the five-year-old in how they ate each other each other and it becomes kind of a self-regulating machine self running machine it and I think a lot of that it's just it's a very human way to learn I just think that you know getting enough erasing the temperature the room the ambient temperatures of what i like to call it the ambient temperature the room high enough that all of a sudden

people start to be able to see things in each other and share and communicate that's that's a whole value of community that I I really like to emphasize your on on you tastic so and talking about getting that message out we talked about a little bit about how you know you're open with your faith it's it's the role model software has even has the cross in in the in the logo and it's it's a hard

balance when you're dealing with a heterogeneous community that has so many different faiths or non faiths has it been a challenge or has been helpful for you going out and sharing your message and also with that you're you live an integrated life and your faith is integrated into your life and into your career all right has that been a

challenger oh yeah some days more family others the the I mean at the end of the day you know I just reading Colossians yesterday and points it you know prices first and everything it takes first place and everything and that's that's the way I live so I can't if he's going to be first place and everything that means includes my work right and you know I think it helps my most of my

clients would say you know they're dealing with people who work with integrity if we say we're gonna do something we do it if we screw up we admit to it we make it right how does it affect my clients even the ones that aren't don't share my faith like that check one of my best clients he's a self-proclaimed pagan and uh you know he said but he's he appreciates our honesty

he's an honest guy himself so that works out fine I do know that there's been people who won't work with us because they just I don't know what they're afraid of I mean it's really interesting that the people who promote tolerance are very intolerant of people who don't share their faith and you know one early on I had a good friend of mine I knew from the small talk meeting when I

started my business shared with me why when I showed my logo my first website came up and he said you know can I appreciate your faith says but man you gotta feed your family you know you don't want to be advertising that people can be turned off get a feed your family i said well you know thanks for that advice but I know who my provider is that I'm eating fine yeah I know and yes

that's the case I definitely know that there are people who turned off by it there were a lot of people who turn off by Jesus Christ I know you know they still are and you know for some reason some people think that the worst thing in the world right now is somebody who actually has a faith and has faith in Christ and believe that there's a thing called sin in the world you know

personally I think sand in the world is a pretty big problem and it was a pretty problem in me and I thank God I have a savior who died for me right I don't want to hide that why should I hide it in the workplace I mean the whole idea that it shouldn't happen were it a better effect everything I do and it does so pumpkin has definitely been a prominent when I had the craftsmanship

academy website there was a somewhere on the line i said here's the behavior and i chose some warning yeah i can see some people might be inflamed by it or whatever so i changed the wording but you know some people just had a fit and just started calling me all kinds of names and it's like look man I'm just trying to tell you that if you come here this is what you're going to be dealing

with we have a biblical worldview when people's don't activate right we're going to ask them to repent and repent is a bad word for some people you know the list of sins are great you know from being if you look in Romans I mean listen things like being disobedient to parents it's called sin there's all kinds of sins and if we don't want to act like there's this thing called sin

we're going to be living in it and there's going to be consequences to that so you know we call people to repent when they act poorly with each other if they're leading destructive lifestyles we would call them to repent and then it doesn't mean you're fired your shot your you should be put in jail right now I'm not out there trying to hate monger but I am to say hey this is jesus christ is

god and there's a thing called sin and we should repent from it that's what he asked people going to do to him so some people just say well i don't share that faith but i'll work with you anyway and others just you know leave skid marks yeah i openly say i was one of those people that had a kind of a visceral reaction at first to what i thought was a negative statement on the on the on

the posting and it was more that I was frustrated because I know what you're doing is good and and it helps more people than getting hooked on one line and it's better to look at somebody holistically what they're what they're doing what their intent kind of where the heart is then to get too hung up on one aspect ah you know that we live in a pluralistic

society in it you know you think one thing I think in other as long as we can live in somewhat reasonable harmony that's what matters and I just was most interested in in exactly what you described it is the how that how how trying to share your fate how trying to communicate your message of craftsmanship and software and professionalism and mentorship and

getting people to adopt those motorcycle ER secular perspectives while trying to balance not getting your message misconstrued or or hindered by people giving hung up on the fact that you're also sharing with the message of your faith yeah it's um you know it's interesting is the word tolerance I mean originally the whole idea of tolerances you tolerate people who think

differently than you and I try to do that I tolerate people who think I've hired some of them you know they don't not everybody hears and shares my same faith We certainly have clients that don't some in a flaming way don't right right but at the end of the day you know if they can tolerate it great you know I have to tolerate their differences they tolerate my differences I believe

intolerant tolerance is a great thing I don't want to see it I don't see it I want tolerance to go back to what it meant right tolerance isn't freedom from religion wait tolerance is freedom of religion right i mean the muslims going to work next to me or a jewish man or a pay a self-proclaimed pagan i mean that's I can work next to them you know and I'll tolerate certain things there

certain things I won't tolerate and there's two things I want to tolerate so uh you know if we can if we get past the the same we can work together if we can't we can't but I'm not going to change who I am and I'm not going to dot then I my lord I mean people have died for that before in history and yeah if I have to die for it someday I will hope it's not okay our teaching and sharing

the concepts of mentorship for a very long time because like i said i think what is important is the message of improving ourselves in each other and sharing then getting hung up on any particular thing so yeah that's that's that was my main perspective right well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down with me I really appreciate your time well thank you for give me the

opportunity sure

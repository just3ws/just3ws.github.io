I hi it's mike with jim tastic i'm here again a groupon and i'm setting your a truck with machi who runs the Orca organize the Chicago ember.js this also a member of the number J escort team thank you very much for taking the time to speak but thanks for taking time stuff to me sure ah so I'm rjs now right now we're in kind of a whole bunch of

client-side frameworks and amber is one of the big ones what what got you in dabbers so much that you became part of the core team that's a good question so back in I started programming in rails sort of serious little mini rails like a lot of people did and I was doing mostly client work and I got to the point that my clients the the expectations they had about what a web application can do sort

of get higher and higher thanks to things like facebook and gmail and they started demanding sort of higher levels interactivity and reactivity that server generated app can generate and so at the time like many people I was searching for a framework but also realizing the stuff out there wasn't very good and working on a framework and this was around the time that the previous frame

rate called sprout core had been formed to sort of adopt more of web standards and I was basically trolling you good cats on the internet saying like this is awful why isn't this done yet and his pitch was like you know this has been a work in progress for multiple years and this is how far we are if you can think of any other project that you know has started go work on that but it's a hard

project and we're the ones making the progress and it's like you're right so I have to go help because I've tried to do this myself because I just he called me out he was like stop complaining and start helping and at that time what are the major drawbacks of all the frames were there is no documentation about how to use any of them so I just cracked my laptop and started like the first file

alphabetically read through it started writing documentation for all the internals and then eventually we started working on certain guides and screencasts and videos okay so you're most have been education and documentation and awareness is that the sometimes when you're in there doing documentation does that feedback like a this doesn't make any sense yes sure so

like everyone in every core kind of works on a little bit of everything but many people of areas of focus mine the past was documentation and yeah if something is hard to explain in English it probably means it's a bad API yeah if you can't talk about it fluently it's really hard to explain it to new people it's probably hard to understand so that definitely feeds back into what

the public API is end up looking like yeah so when people are working as when a project open source project was calling for documentation this isn't just something that's fluffy and you know a nice to have it helps define the terminology of them absolutely and I actually think though I mean I'm biased but I think documentation work or learning and education has actually some

of the hardest open-source work to do not only do you have to be sort of have enough engineering chops to read through code and understand what it's doing and what its intent is you also have to have enough communication and teaching chops to then distill that down into useful examples you know Kitty descriptions that's having both of those skills is sort of complicated I've two degrees

have an undergrad in English literature and master's degree in human-computer interaction so I think the two of those combined is kind of like an ideal person to go around and being like how does this work and if the answer is nobody knows to tell the world how it works yeah and so young Robbie started doing this documentation how did that trans transition from being a contributor to

be a member of the team so yes it's at the time we didn't have like an official core team it was just a free-for-all of people contributing however they felt they could best help and I was doing a lot of contributions both coding and documentation and then before the first summer conference march of two years ago a lot of the heavy contributors were sitting in a room and it was like this

should be our core team these would be the people sort of guide the framework moving forward so it was kind of just who's here who's committing yep who's here investigating who doesn't seem like they're a total bozo because you haven't even in any open source project or any project in general you get people who are like heavy committers but sort of have a weird notion about how things

should be done Weatherby has strange perspective a limited experience so there's the combination of like who's committing heavily and who seems like the racket of Connect craziness into the code base yeah so there's a trust yet a lot of trust involved so so you're involved in ember now you're running a user but that's come on this is your first

intergroup us yes abhi they ever jst zerg it was my first one I kind of fell into it there was a lot of enthusiasm in Chicago early on forever I was already overwhelmed doing my full-time job here groupon doing UI development and then all my open source contributions in a lot ways it's like I work two full time jobs right and then it was someone was like we should do a meet up and I'm like

yes you should do a meet up and I'm really happy to attend so he started doing those and also had them at a time so there were just a lot of one of mess ups in scheduling times and getting speakers so I think we scheduled once like September of two years ago and then like failed to actually hold the event like four or five times in a row and then in January was he was just like I

can't do this anymore and it was like I guess it's my responsibility now yeah something did let it die it did not let it die down yeah so I if you learned a lot it didn't change your when you interact with the community and before mostly were probably online communicating the people now you're actually meeting meet space with people yeah I mean I learned a lot about both

who's using ember and sort of what difficulties they have which definitely informs you know where public API is need to be nicer but also learn a lot about running a user group I think there's this perception that a lot of people have that like it's well I definitely are a lot of like oh it's not that hard to put together yeah or you know sometimes people want to charge for

user groups like five ten bucks and people to understand like why would you try or if they should be free not understanding that like just the materials cost of a small meetup can easily be like 5 600 bucks if you tell us a time and they're like you're pushing you know for a small 30-40 person Nina importance of months you're pushing at like 12 thousand dollars

instead of time which is kind of eye-opening for me so I'm much more appreciative out of other meetups where I go to looks like the hard work that goes inside screen right there people don't know is the personal time that goes into stem yeah it's just you think about if your consultant yeah i mean if i were really about our great for a furmeet up it would have to be really

like no one could do that yeah expensive yeah so I has an overall been a positive experience or you know are you looking at like oh this is this a lot of fun open maybe not quite as much fun and this because we all have different experiences and I have talked about fuser groups it's okay to quit if it's that pot has it been enjoyable yeah I

think it's I mean super five minutes I'm always excited to see the ways people are using ember back when we started fairly early on we were very heavily pushing for like energy essence for apps it's not just a few layer like angular or reactive is I mean think the angular drag people would be very open and like I know the react guys are basically like we're we're kind of a replacement for

jquery we're not a full application framework number is a full application framework and yet we kept getting people doing presentations of like I built this content site in m / or like my HTML and CSS person doesn't know a lot of JavaScript he uses a rapid prototyping tool which was just like oh I never would have thought people would you say we're very focused on the application

case but it turns out when you end up with like a meaningful set of primitives you can compose them and all sorts useful ways yeah is it sounding it's more like how Wales has become in spurts it's a multi-purpose general build an app if well thank you very much i don't know i'm just going to talk to me thanks Pat are just real quick you're on mean up right yep yep where I'm you dope calm

our next meetup should be later this month if this gets back to the time but here in on regular schedule we don't have a regular schedule so mostly what I'll do is I'll put a call out for proposals people can use the meetup site to say like I'd like to talk about this when enough people say that sounds like a cool topic then we sort of go searching for a time and venue okay so

if you're interested in a number in JavaScript check out to me not get thanks okay user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations a plethora of information find out for yourself today at Utah State calm Oh you

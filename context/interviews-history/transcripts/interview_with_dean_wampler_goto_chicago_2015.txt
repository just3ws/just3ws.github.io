it's mike with you task i'm here going to go to kop 2015 sitting your routine whopper was giving a talk on data science with spark thank you very much for taking that dirty community you know the big question is and kind of jokingly what is data science but more in the moment what is spark so spark is a distributed computing engine designed for data systems that was invented about

five or so years ago as a research project in berkeley and it's now an Apache project and is now an official tool in the Hadoop ecosystem but even outside as well for you either processing like large data sets that you have either on you know the file system somewhere or a database for data streaming in from site via Twitter or you know your log files or whatever so

you can do these transformations analyze it even machine learning algorithms like looking for anomalies or making predictions and things like that interesting about the logs that it's one of those aspects to be kinda as developers forget as weel data in there can tell us a lot about how our systems are working um but the the thing I'm thinking about is there's been kind of a

theme from some of the interviews I've spoken to you about this concept of these are these new ways of electric I don't know if they're second-generation versions of these massive processing systems you know what is it about spark compared to like ignites or some of the other vendor offerings we have here yeah so that you made a good point that it's kind of a second generation tool it's

really sort of a rethinking of the original big tool called MapReduce which actually was invented it Google making it more flexible for different problems more efficient so that you can do things like highly iterative processing that turns out to be important for things like machine learning or you're representing your data as a graph and you need to walk the edges of the graph

that sort of thing you know it compared to like some of the commercial tools that are available it's it's a little rough around the edges because it's you been open source it was like a research project that's rapidly being adopted by industry so a lot of times it's a question of do I have the scale requirements and maybe the flexibility to work with an open source tool and I'm

less concerned about something that's maybe as mature as mature and commercially supported it's like a proprietary system or some of the proprietary systems are really really good its particular kinds of problems and particular kinds of users and whereas something like spark it's more general purpose and can be more widely used but you may have to do a little

more self-service at this stage but that's you know I like all open source projects which in this case it happens to be maybe the most active in the world right now with with the possible exception Linux or something you think's just rapidly improve and people fill in the gaps where needed a even the I work for type safe and we're supporting spark commercially now and we're also

contributing to spark and how it runs on top of the mezzos framework for example which is an alternative to do even there's a standalone mode if you just have a small cluster you want to wire up and then just go if it's also an interesting option now spark is going to want those hardwoods to Google is there what's the is our project page mention Apache is it yeah I was Google when I

want to get to the page pachi spark okay and it's parked at Apache or this is the homepage for it so yeah that's CIP right after work it's not Julie or Google yeah friendly word yeah well thank you very much for taking the time speaking much later thank you you

jennifer jones shoe civilian organizer for my visions chicago 2013 and that's not that is a tongue twisters haha but uh you know when i try and think you've been particular times development no it's really busy yeah wait um so how did you get involved in the book visions what does what is your job in organized so our executive director and the brain behind web visions is brad smith and he

is crazy enough to have been doing this for 13 years and two years ago he said I'm just crazy enough to take this to four other cities in the United States and the world and I can't do it by myself work and our children are the same age and I have been organizing events at their school and he and his wife approached me and said how would you like to organize something a little

out of your your comfort zone Wow and so I came on board and started helping him with the logistics of taking it brother so this is your hats loose in the tech industry I was not in the tech industry as a matter of fact he said you should probably get a facebook yeah yeah since all that stuff I mean I saw it has to be so but it is something i'm curious about coming in and looking at it from a

almost an outsider's perspective on the industry has this been educational or warnings for GE I'm just it very educational and only in that I feel like a web visions specifically uh in a bubble after a year of working at the conferences and meeting all of our attendees I had a conversation with one of our speakers and I said I was just so impressed with how approachable and and

nice and an affable all of our attendees ours the tech industry must be the same way and she said oh my god where have you been I said web visions yeah so I feel like our clientele if you will is some has given me a very nice introduction into an industry which maybe is a little more backbiting and cutthroat than I've experienced well definitely usually have

a more positive vibe for people to come out for the community we were excited about it right that's just how they make their money where they make their life right it's very passionately go yeah so how many years have you been working this is your first year no since 2011 or some 2011 this is my second round of a full year of web version Chicago cone around set out so going from organized

smaller local events to broader larger city what are some of the lessons you've learned or things that if maybe you didn't expect when you coming in it is very challenging coming into a new city I'm getting to know the area what visions is all about community so we don't want to just bring the Portland model to a new place we want to kind of morph it so that it fits the cities that

it's in which means making a lot of local contacts with some influential and really knowledgeable clever people and I think the biggest challenge is a snot assuming that every city is going to be the same very very different Portland has a very specific vibe and if we are lucky less were than mine yes we're under the night sky where the 30 year olds go to retire right um lots of

bicycles and food carts and we'd love to take all that with us but then we get to those cities and realize they love what they have or just as much so watching and making sure that we accurately take that community feel in the new city and make that part of the web visions in so it's the same content but wrapped in the culture of yeah yes and one of the interesting things I actually worked in

one of the companies are so work at one of the companies it didn't deserve yeah which I thought was very interesting that all of a sudden see people from what visions yeah walking through through where I work is it is that so basically their tours that are pre-conference tours of different businesses yeah have any other studios and shops in the area is that a Chicago

Georgia know what you know those local brilliant people I was telling you about that we contact and say I help us bring wide missions to your city one of the things we say to them is you give us a list of some really fabulous companies that are doing innovative work that are trying to pioneer things in their field and who would be willing to have a small group of attendees come through and you

can have staff members talk to them and tell them why and tell them what the future and will cast a wide net maybe six or seven studios for get an email from us saying i'm interested in four or five sometimes three sometimes six we respond and say oh my god would love to have you come through and one of my colleagues actually went on the tour last year and she was able yeah they do

this to her thing nice to know from you chicago thing no we do it in portland we did it in atlanta and we do it in barcelona this year we took some of the barcelona model which was a walking tour because it was it's really beautiful when we're there in june and hit barcelone is extremely historic right and we're able to wrap around the city and talk about but of course there

you're getting thing knowledge from the 1400s right here that's our culture and it's forming them five but yes that there's the Barcelona it has a very neat almost ancient culture right Chicago wall my points are each invites 40 barber right like some people at once a week we get a chance to look at some of the history of the area because we walked through chicago on the studio

tours and i learned things like the river is a man-made river that goes Larry Chicago and it flows the wrong way so that you can get things where you need them to go and that's pretty fascinating stuff well I'm again it's a very fascinating fascinating giving this atomic share with you is a pleasure 30 very much user groups with gloves to say interviews and more no way sharing great

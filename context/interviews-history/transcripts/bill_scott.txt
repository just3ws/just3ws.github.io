user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm hi it's mike with new tastic so here are the locations 2013 jeans as far as they film some a Chicago see now ago Scotty bill is well somebody who language was

recommended to me by love people are my buddy else today on the acceleration sit down and talk bill is a you work with paypal yeah but can you describe what your title is because it was a little bit yeah more than I stuff so I had up what's called what I call user interface and engineering and so think of it as the front-end development engineer know all about technologies so my background

basically is I came from netflix before I came to New Balance they had closely with signed to you by four years pregnant look at team up and then when I was not who they're I did my design pattern I'm re i was also being jackson age listed and my passions ramezani so a few small companies yeah just woke up you can i also have a booklet a rally car designing web interfaces okays

strictly a design because i'm one of those weird hybrids that that can do javascript engineering but also do what what is the animal on mine is the most amazing one possible so the design books have burns right yeah so mine is the of the rock I the only yeah yeah I didn't pick it yeah yeah a big did so okay yeah that's always fun if I know what the animal was yeah um let's get a

picture of it us Nadia because the one of my head is not yeah i see about that so so okay so i mean obviously you have a very broad depth of experience in but there's one thing that's in particular interesting that's just happened with paypal here at chicago and that is the acquisition of retreating one of my major revision financial credit card service by paypal yeah I do

have any insight to what happened well i know i know the so the arc that that it ties in really well what I even talked about the workshop and the day to talk we've been on a journey to transfer paypal of innovative company right they polish play a very good brand and very successfully money it's made certain things like that when I was leaning Netflix in two thousand whether it was

pretty obvious that thing I wasn't really on my radar murs on YouTube but I do 15 folks there with the CTO then I had a lot of respect so in the previous texts and so they talking about coming me we started a journey when David Marcus became president in April 2012 to transform paypal to the parade mean in phila like a scarf here's the use of plain glass so the acquisition of ranger

ii really is another step is an evolution it's like here here's obviously an incredible company that started out as mu good lighting screen is making a huge impact definitely a strong and develop is it awesome emails also had been mowed New York rating click Reena mobile app so you have mobile towns API time we are already transferring our AP is this is kind of

texas next level wit and one of the cool things we're going to do because David's are cute this is Sarah laundry with your honor our president know til paypal eve holy knit starters so we got a quarter to paper so these girls exactly she's now is right now he's quarter yeah so it's very very important that we let great tree continue to be innovator is and will still be called Braintree be

you know be able to do not do it change anything the other then give it a great broader breath and much more fragile immortal and the larger ebay family and fits really well there's no person we're really excited fact i met michael buckley you see here one of the product designers product managers uh he's actually my talk and the braintree they know when I've actually

interviewed yeah wonderful performer you tested and just extremely that ok so that's for advancement I'm interested in when you're booking also the concept of a new acts that you're teaching you know what does that mean yeah so if you feel checked out have spoke minivans are chosen come on the backside okay cool yeah yeah so if you think that lean startup me wait startup really knows

about you know how do i get to customers quick as possible adelaide validate myers assumptions how do I pivot or the lean startup two startup sorry I cannot only new axe falls onto that so Jeff got help actually wrote a book on menu acts and we started using the same ideas what they knew X recesses and going to doing design you know it's not only about delivering documentation it's about the

liberal experience and during that collaboratively with engineering design the product altogether closing some of those loops yeah and break those walls down be very collaborative in nature as much as possible and even live in the same worried the same space together and operate like a start-up stir so this is very episode to a large nothing like PayPal that you know from an inner basic

respect your pet obviously stagnation coming up to two thousand eleven and finally it just took me it could take six weeks to change this works are there so now we're down to less financially okay stay still 85 so it's you know we could transform the technology stack I talked about that you're saying or something all with this idea in mind how do you get engineered so I'm actually

running another book right now for the lean startup series coupling engineering okay an auntie of lean engineering is if you think about engineering from the perspective of there morning what do you do different ones things you do different reaction engineer prototype yet you don't think of prototyping separate activity you actually get the product ships or

prototypes so we've actually engineered our architecture now so that the prototype stack is the same as the productions that we use know Jas these and JavaScript laying on top of that we can run that on our Java stock or a nose factor Russian Coast bustracker templates so what we do in prototype and what weekly or every other week basis we can feed right the agile stream you know

a little more massaging camera actually those so you actually get this accommodate you know you can also take the product inform it again you know just do sit usability studies we call you like scrum team and take out my back into Angela so how different is that from the concepts of like MVP Minimum Viable proud of you is it is it the same it's awesome folks it's important

because what you can do if you got a real rapid prototyping side as you can print MVP now you could create you know there's a larger process of you know going out to customers doing visits or food studies or surveys or whatever also that may take a just a prototype or using you know something like that or like a prototype on paper it should take pictures you get your stitching together

you got it working perfect or you know maybe it's like an action which is important I go to a lot of tools you can use but when i was done in the last two days really more what happens when you're good at first imagined yeah you actually want to work somehow Mary design process which has been a long time question the way we've solved that is by having of lean UX grunting run

someone over the head of the agile construction but some of the same team members split between the two teams and the lean UX scrum team is focused on pushing out prototypes and showing the customer just our sprint with existing okay where's the agile suitably encode it so that's actually do you have these two teams of running in parallel or near parallel little bit off from each other

using to subtly different methodologies Mary what was what was the reason they've been misusing the scrum methodology for their book they're both use sort of a scrum methodology you know the lady new axe does so agile you know agile scrum asshole a lot of eclectic talks terrible right true bro stand-ups the relation so there still is still the concept of stand-ups you know the girl

scrum team but there's not like a lot of stories the backlog it's for example as much work hafsa scrimmage be much more rapidly sketching or creating a design getting in prototype form and then getting in usability testing so you've learned and then what comes out of that it feeds out of that ish stories for the backlog imagine code that you can actually wear yes cuz you develop the UI

to fairly high no web state you know it's a happy path and you've got some of the application built in so that we can tell you the coordinates what would like to do is flip engineers between the rain and the agile so they are always have internal customers so this much more customers yeah it's frigid because it's that makes me think oh right like the spike into production kind of odd yeah

build something just good enough yeah it just clean it up and put it yeah production code base yeah so I think of this I'm it's like you know science I'd use the center you know engineer we say see I CD continuous integration to each deployment we give again continuous innovation to use design so that the design is always um looking back at some of the big companies tried to bring in

agile work working with more agile methodologies its larger complex it might be a little before let's say traditional yeah little maybe a little bit stuck in a lot as it is it happens on occasion um is it been something that's been openly embraced after the bottom upwards was pushed down it's been bottom event yeah an outside-in I would say to if

you're actually looking change models generally the best changing balancer top-down bottom-up and new DNA from the outside coming in because you do need need DNA in organization because big organizations that have gotten static what's happened is you know they don't even know why that you stupid stuff right let's do stupid stuff listen to it and there's actually smart people in

there swapping life stupid or you know existed the way organizations work like that and you and then you get some bad Dana and you have some antibodies that are in the organization there was this change and so you have to flush the system how do you have to like you know get rid of some of those anybody's change someone's anybody's and dimension being something positive to change going

so yeah it's you know let me think how Franklin coming in 2011 Netflix I knew what it is like done a lot of Investigation it was giving screwed up and it screwed up the technology process inside everything this I don't think there was a single you know organization from funding it from a customer centric perspective that was really operating right and some of us you know because

they they had to at some point right the ship and really turn the dial towards your risk they'll be risk averse make sure payments went through and in that whole pic I'm swing he lose the experience she lose the fact that you're freezing accounts and putting the council whole that are very good people that are gonna share anywhere else and all those stories get out there yeah

over time it creates this very angry because what you do with people some minor personally affects them right and they don't forget it yeah and yeah in your right day I hadn't even thought about that before this interview but about the there's the constants Orion reddit about the yeah my this charity or my Kickstarter got frozen I don't know why yep and what we do is what data does

is I do this a bunch of us do this we're watching ready we're watching a continues watching Twitter as soon as you see something like that we go fix the problem but then what we do is we look under the cover say okay what's the policy change so does the things overnight you know for example I had get to was exactly but I had you know one of the conference organizers all of

a sudden you got this accounts frozen mine and we went to work on it and you know it was obvious that look this is a common occurrence you can't just say if somebody's all of a sudden money starts coming in really very fast if that's bad thing because there are certain scenarios where that works so the wrist team has to know different mom yeah just think about I got 120 million customers

it's not like somebody sitting in going I'm it freezes County it's his computer algorithm experiments right and then what happens you have if your cost report to them is not enabled to fix those problems in you you double whammy right so just second of mine so David did things like you know that had the team actually that doesn't cause some sport some of them lately actually

enabling what they call tokens almost like good little tough right well basically if they they can take on the substance and fix any problems and can't get fired from if they make mistake you learn from this thing so you have a certain counties target you utilized stuck finishing its it's like you know jlabel we're gonna trust me yet to just do what you gotta do yeah but when I'm a

safeguard yeah and it's a little bit of spending their you never with it you know so you know composition we do you think about it oh yeah this is obvious to Big Sam so those kind of things have changed and we actually you know I don't know the exact number was a pretty high number each month less calories is less complex funny story i give you find stories so uh last the early this year

her story came on hacker news but listen kid who created javascript library animation worker and he was junior in college I had actually in Northern Kentucky University and Pepa high logs discount this evening tremendous amount on my tremendous amount of money in a very short period of time and get on hacker news and said I think you said something like I me about two hundred

thousand dollars and becomes like my account yeah so we saw we may know which work unlock discount we have really gained an amazing step 4 the best interns I've ever had yeah and he's coming back bloom in my office come back next year he joins in last had a blast we're about to such articles about that and I really love doing that because you know PayPal has a

game at Auckland last week their economies and one of the guys are Brenda stories about it and said he called my talking mesmerizing because he said all of us in the crowd had written paypal off as being in the dark ages right and it was so refreshing because he not really in the charge on though with one of the companies is actually we're about to open source a bunch of frameworks but

you know we brought a bunch of cooking from the outside or the companies we also had some great people inside there or in there and we changed it I kind of like this that's a funny story for me is you know how do i get engineering design work together how to bake technology and frankly i'm having no trouble recruiting off i'm getting some really great people because you know people within today

engineers and designers you ever what you're going to work on is really important impact so we get them who are you going to work with so I've brought some great people in from lots of good companies that's supporting and how you're going to work that's just lean UX mean style working it's critical you get the hue how the what down right yeah what you got a piece of that could make

a good location apps oh but those are all those are all you know they're not the main right people make all kinds of sacrifices to get to have you won well I mean it sounds like you one of the things one of the things from the pure pop a story like damn man made two hundred thousand dollars office library is he's got some decent seed money that he can try to think of anything yeah but

convinced him that you obviously had to bring something other than just pure money not to have it say yeah you're going to have this environment you're going to be have some latitude just made up to do something interesting well for you know fortunate at the same time I've hired a friend of mine used to have a surgeon netflix ain't gone on to be the CTO of mobile thinkin priestly hit been

an Amazon have addition cloud and early days mac OS it's the guys well travel react wonderful guy so we were bringing a manual the intern and it worked directly with Ron so you got to work best minds yeah around and tell that's Olympus at this month that's more than right yeah right and then course Jeff peril my team is just really brilliant another guy

Eric lever on netflix and filled in hopes of a netflix we're just really smart awesome guys who get the full package and not just its just notch engineering but its designs customer-centric and that's what drives someone like a menu right his intern is in the day he's passionate about creating best experience possible he would he would sit there and go you know

when I do this because he was building an html5 equivalent or any of that and in daily in for the scrolling doing all the crazy complicated stuff he's going like look when i move this and I could see because I'm a pixel mania to write but some of the people team could see it it everyone's wad tube jigs x 1 pixel I just drove in hunting so yeah I'm gonna get that right and i love that attention

to detail and course i have that too so i think you enjoyed or poorly me because i would come back and say you know the friction is not exactly right physics is not exactly right on this issue a lodge experienced worse than a TV so how so on are showing you know let's say no you notice now you know how these have the very last you know little bit slows down and so within about an hour you cannot

check this out yet no yeah yeah and he'd love that you know being challenged like that so yeah in knowing that he's working with people he can respect yeah yeah but i mean it's not about the true net perspective working for those somebody was you want to be channeled yeah who's going to push you like somebody's been there yeah Sam well thank you very much for getting

sentenced I my brother Jordan is great to meet you likewise thank you thank you user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yep you guessed it calm you

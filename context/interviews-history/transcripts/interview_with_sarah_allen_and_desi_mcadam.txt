hi i'm mike with you tastic here going to SCA I'm sitting down with Sarah Allen and Desi macadam they created the railsbridge workshop which is well i'll let you describe what exactly is the rails bridge workshop so railsbridge is a broad organization that was started by a number of rails developers who really wanted to create the kind of community that they wanted to be a part of sarah

mae and myself started on what's so as the rails bridge project it's the rails which open workshops and specifically in San Francisco we used the open workshop formula to create outreach workshops to women and the idea is we're using open-source practices to apply to event organization and outreach projects so the the what we call recipes or book for creating the event as well as the

curricula are all open source and freely available for anybody to use for anything and then desi has happened to be traveling all over the world and it has created instances of these workshops wherever she's been as well as dozens for many many other volunteers who have done that all over the country what's the format what is it what is it or the current as you said it's an open

sourcing so it I'm sure there's some evolution what is the current format of me so the core format is a friday night saturday event where on friday all of the installation occurs so you have volunteers who come and help people get their machine set up because that is often the most difficult part for beginners and it really has nothing to do with the you know writing code or do

give you a wall either particular technology it would be on my computer boom on yeah i mean particularly rails is so many collections of open source packages and it's particularly hard on you know and it's different for each machine you're on once you've got Ruby and rails installed it's easy and then it's different for the different technologies and in fact

there's now a front end workshop that doesn't have evening install fest because everybody has a browser and text editor yeah yeah that one's um but but for the rails workshop that is really an important step and then Saturday is everybody follows the same curriculum and you have at least two groups one is for people who've never written code before and the other is for you know

whatever degree maybe they already hit show about but they never do drills exactly so sometimes we'll find that people who are sis admin's are faster learning rails then experienced programmers who maybe have done desktop applications but aren't very familiar with the command line so your level of experience as a coder doesn't necessarily correlate to how fast you'll

learn the very first episode so you might have predisposed towards well this is how we do it on the desktop whereas somebody who's maybe he's had some scripting experience doesn't have maybe it's rigorous a mindset on oh yeah it has to be this way because you'll have different learning curves for people who've done web apps so they understand HTTP versus people who've done c++

therefore they understand object-oriented programming versus people who have done a lot of command-line stuff and so they're very facile with the scripting aspects of it so we try to group people into like-minded experience but mostly it's depending on the size of the workshop the grouping is flexible depending on the venue and the size of the number of

volunteers and teachers you have and sometimes it's just everybody's in a room and we figure it out yeah and doesn't you are you want to sit yeah I was just going to say in addition to that so like typically I tried to try to group people based on very broad generalization so I program before I've never programmed before or I've done some rails but I need some more help

with you no more advanced concepts and then split the people apart and try to get TAS that match sort of those like comfort levels of teaching and you said you you've gone all over the world and done these all over I'm just curious I like all I mean literally like when you say world where was I I've done in them so I've done one I did quite a few in the United States and I've done one in

Singapore and I've helped out with one in in Chile and I can't remember ever girls but that it's it's it's really easy to once you've seen one run and you have a desire to do them it's really not very difficult if you you know paying the mailing list everybody will tell you what the latest you know we just ran one last weekend and this is what we ran into we bar need a pull request to

update the documentation you know Saturday's are so that everybody's super helpful and there's some really nice side effects that come from that a lot of people who don't really know anything about the workshops go to our instructions for how to install rails because you know a new version of this or that comes out and the install instructions change but because now

there are workshops happening several times a month in lots of different places those those are updated by the volunteers and their different volunteers every time so it is also kind of becoming a documentation unto itself not just a script for how to do these these classes but also paid I just need to set up where else yes yeah there's a lot of different things that come out

of it and you know educational resources and set up resources and different things so that that's a pretty neat side effect of their community and I do want to ask about the social aspect the way I understand is that the legend is that Sara Ellen and sir may were at a conference and they didn't see a lot of other women that you realized that you were the only two women and hundreds of

people and you wanted to create something that would help bring yeah so that the stats are there we're at a conference where there were 200 people in six women so that's three percent which is reflective of or thirty percent well in any case it's around the number of women in open source which is much much smaller than the number of women in the corporate world doing programming

and I came more from companies which were which worth less involved with open source where I felt that there were not very many women but there were more women than I saw in the Ruby community and I've been meaning to learn Ruby for three years before i had started learning ruby in 2008 and so i thought and i still believe it's true that there are more women programmers in the bay

area than there are Ruby programmers what therefore if there's twenty percent of programmers are women over R to infinity Ruby developers no it's it's actually more we have a bigger opportunity okay because wood is a small language so therefore if we just convert some of the existing programmers to know Ruby then it would be easy to get actually get fifty percent in any of the

new languages I think we have a real big opportunity to do that because in any specific community we can change the ratio much easier because it's smaller than just you know the boil in the ocean problem I also heard that in startups it's also a boys club culture as well and virginity I did an interview with Jenny a few months ago and she described it as one

that startup happens it's you to some friends to get together and they start to start up and then they hire people like that it from there all network is that something that you seen in the startup world where it's it tends to be male-dominated companies just well statistically um tech founders are two to three percent women and I think that a lot of that there is a culture in the

United States that is where men have a debt networks and men see the those kind of opportunities as available to them for whatever reason but I do think that the social dynamics of creating situations where women and men and people of all colors and creeds can get together and learn together then we forge those networks where by example people see that what you happen to look

like the words you use your background doesn't dictate that you are more or less capable of doing these technical things and and when somebody walks into a rails bridge workshop they can't tell by looking at somebody whether they're an expert programmer or very successful in their career or unemployed and all of these things are not correlated with each other and they're not correlated

with how to look and so so that's really exciting to me that I hope it will bring that change broadly but in any case we are seeing it as absolutely making those changes in pockets and I think that we need to overcome this problem one person at a time when it's all over the way eventually this community scream well I think that we're talking about in changing the ratio is a boiling the

ocean kind of problem however since we've proven that this template can be fairly easily reproduced by anyone I like to think that we can boil the ocean by making every tenth molecule a heater okay so so but basically planning the seats are that way it can at least distribute these ideas beyond a small community in and basically yeah and we're seeing this happen in Ruby

JavaScript Heights Python Scala oh yeah that so are all of these rural roads bridges by definition rails oriented but have you done these for well rails bridge was created the name rails was a little controversial when we were naming it but we felt that it was coming out of rails developers but the teaching kids project has always taught has never taught rails um however the Python folks

felt like it would alienate their community call it rails voyage so they called it pi star because there was already applied bridge something but now we're creating an umbrella organization that will be able to support all of these different okay so that way you don't have to bias that well I don't to do that I don't like rails it's do you have a well I won't make you say the

name now because I'm sure my change that's up but but it's recognizing the fact that we're we're software developers yeah not reals yeah and I think most of us are doing rails right now right and rhinos from now we'll be doing something else yeah right now being out the port of their pieces everything changes and with with going into a conference in and have you have

you been seen since you've started doing this more women at this is a more diversity I mean st natick is an excellent conference I've noticed a big difference actually yeah and I think that part of it is that the women in the some women in the community who weren't coming out to events because they felt alienate have started to come out more and then the new people in the

community have connections to people already in the community the other thing that has happened in parallel is a lot of the event organizers have realized that they need to take initiative to change how they ask for speakers to create a diversity among speakers and if we have more women speakers then it's less alienating to have for women from the event they they feel like there are

role models and mentors for them and it's easier to look at a group of 20 people and if you see yourself represented then you feel like hey that could be me recently I learned about a picture that was very popular in the Obama administration of when Obama first took office he was meeting with some some people and are some children they are not exactly sure context why they

were there but one of the boys who's black and he just said three partly said he asked this question they couldn't hear what he said me sm speak up and he said I want to I just want to know if your hair feels like mine and that the photographer got this amazing picture that was very candid and it was the president leaning down and this little boy touching his head and what was so

inspiring what that is that it was the years this generation now seeing somebody like them in in a position of authority and responsibility and are you saying that seeing women speaking and running these conferences running these organizations says to the women there's people like you doing this yeah I think that there is this myth in our industry that there are no women that somehow

women are less in that are less capable because as evidence by there being so few and I've talked to women who've been the only woman in their company and then they start to say well that's just the way the industry is especially if you've been through two jobs like that but the truth is numbers-wise there's tons of amazing technical women in our field and

the fact that historically we haven't seen them at conferences is a cultural artifact that is not related to their lack of existence and so by creating diversity and I think we don't have it we don't only have a gender diversity problem have diversity there long many angles problem but I think that the more that we create we find these people these people who are doing technically

amazing work and they've been in the industry for 5 10 20 years and we celebrate their success the more that we draw in people and we ever and nobody should say oh I can't see anybody who looks like me I don't belong here I mean the dream of technology is that it's a meritocracy that it's a great equalizer and it's just a terrible thing that it's not actually happening right and so

that's how I really trying to change anybody who says that women can't code never met great or never run about Grace Hopper I you know it's it's it's it's means it's all really ridiculous but I do want to thank you again for sitting down with me and they work you're doing with railsbridge outreach Thanks care

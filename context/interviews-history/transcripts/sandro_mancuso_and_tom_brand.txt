hi I'm Mike I'm sitting down with Sandro and Tom's from the London software craftsmanship group and a top excuse me center can you tell us a little bit about London software craftsmanship sure we started belt august two thousand so basically it came up with an idea of myself and a friend of mine dave green so we used to meet just to talk about software and ketchup and stuff and then

all of a sudden setup made to be great if we could have more people coming along and sharing their ideas uh preferably if they come from other languages as well enough job right so so London we we had this idea of having a group of people that could meet regularly I took this idea to the London java community and spoke to some of the guys I didn't know anything about

partnership but they love the idea of having a group of people different professionals coming along and having a child and then they said why don't you create a cross fishing community them and they're gonna support you as well because we would love to attend the meetings and that's how it started so that night I went to home just set up the group and meetup.com and then we can

also our first meeting at it yeah in that in a and what so you went from two people were you sitting now with that but it was typical attendance yeah it is a bit crazy because like by the way and start with you know exactly how to start it's okay we want to create a script is just dated myself so like where do you go from there and then because we realize that the people they spoke that

we spoke to didn't know anything what problems he pensado but when we could give a talk or cross-match it right if we have like 10 15 people obtaining that would be great well turned out that we had more than 100 registering at your address top 100 100 yes yeah and then we were scared because public before sometimes I can't do that and Jen then so after that that that that talk a lot

of people very inspired in the whole thing the whole craftsmanship thing and then we try to go back to our original idea that was like having a group of people that meets regularly and then we come up with the round table so today after just over a year you have 429 members we promote it she ain t three meetings we are going at the speed of 15 to 20 members per month

and yeah that's about it she you've got a monthly meetup right that's we have a few things we every Wednesday every second Wednesday of the month forget our roundtable meetings that are by far the most popular it's limited to 30 people it's a good discussion people come along we put topics on the whiteboard many unconference minion conference so we always meet in the same company with

there is a company where they used to work for that they started on the dryness work for so they pay all the geeks SMG years and stuff so we have the space after 639 so people put the topics then they explain what they want to discuss can be anything flip software developer from they want to show a piece of code or they want to discuss architecture or how to do a giant

distributed teams around the world break anything so and then we wrote the most voted topics we discussed sometimes between groups and I discussed one topic per night it was from five right so that that's that's the wrong table we have every last Wednesday of the month we have a hands-on recording session that slims it to 40 people okay that's always oversubscribed as well we always have

authorities and we have some spare sporadic meetings like an app called retreats we have talks and other stuff regular meetings we have to and very soon you'll have three okay see so Q roundtables a month though it's one room table 11 hands-on session one run okay all right in and up with it but the extreme the arch group you know we were talking love it earlier about how it

became too much for just two guys to you to to manage so you wanted to spread that out that's where time comes in with with the associates group can you explain a little bit about what's the associates and that meantime we can talk about what you do in that so like so first what is the idea of the associates grouping and then but I can explain what how it came about

these came from the London at the London Java user group has 2,000 members today so it was too much for just keep you organized so they tighten right some people to that could contribute but they don't need they are not fully committed they could leave whenever they can right so tom was always one of our main members like very active my stories yeah sure I'm yeah I'm 11 reasons why I'm an

associate because currently out of software craftsmanship group it's quite heavily to java.net based literally because of the association to the London job community an opportunity and we don't really have a bunch of a ruby presence and sorry I'm one moment you can really all that like you talked of three developers okay i know of people in sort of ruby industry that would be

interested so forth cosmic so do you have separate meetings for the sort of like is it because you said you have a limit of 30 but you have six hundred or so registered members do you have a suburb meeting for like at a difficult age chambers over there for four we associate groups yeah we we meet up as the sort of associate group we've only have one meeting so folks we've okay on

this one more okay where we let you just sit down discuss oh it is the sort of the neck sort of hands-on session so we're going to who wants to do then how we can healthy travel with them okay oh my god sister yeah yeah we also discussed like the plans for for the group as a whole where we are taking the group so the whole direction of the group because now dave this is moving to

Italy so it's just me from the original founders and so the idea that I brought to us as he said I want diverse state and I will job developers I want diversity so there is a guy from android community Tom from movie and then our achiever from from from Java but I want more diversity so we discuss the the Tonto talked about but also where are we going as a group what our next

step in terms of my auto makers you program that we wanted to do the connections to other communities like that's what we're doing here so that's the thing that just so shades would be discussing but as I said there is a difference between the leadership team and associates associates are they contribute whatever they can write loads already but they have great ideas but it

caught commit to the same level like David myself come every month sometimes many hours a month from wells yeah weeks because like we need to sort out all the venues or the contest decide that so the idea with the associates is to bring people that want to help but don't want to commit straightaway right and as soon as they get the a start getting more involved then you bring them to the

leadership team and then you have like my full commitment but they need to see if they want to be that Christ so that you can support I've seen that the harm or sometimes people are saying yes I want to do this and then they get into a little while and they're like wow to see a lot of time we do it maybe I really am not that passionate about this I draw you know it's interesting for me Zawya I

haven't really worked in a in a community group like this before and a ball been part in this sort of higher level people there and yes it's really interesting to the training that you get from this talking to guys like Sandra David on metal organization being a present as well right and learning a very skilled to also helping out in the community yeah yeah it's rich yet and i

also wanna introduce you later on to you later it's a very similar model here in chicago for the Ruby community in the two are two main groups cheetahmen cities we talk about that later Lucas um and give lombardi seen his interview ah oh so they'd all about what Williams doing um yeah no it's fascinating and and you said you're also working with some other or you've any communications

or trying to set up communications with some other user groups that are a short sentence in Paris and Germany and Israel can you tell us of the height of working those groups to help them or to these connect and sugar sure so when they deny we sat down lost almost that we finished our first two years ago mean so we had a meeting so cash we had an amazing year amazing first year where do

you go from there so we've done a lot for our community London so he made it a reality but then we realize that you're not doing much for the partnership movement as a whole right so so we said we need you to try to spread that need to make custom shape flourish if you're like in other places so part of our mission was to go to other conferences in other countries and start sharing our

experience because they do not we couldn't even organize our own birthdays so we're not organized already yeah we had no idea what we were what we were doing and how many people would turn out but we learnt a lot in one year in terms of finding venues sponsors and how to attract members so I want or do you want to have a local commission or they don't have one right and they are scared

should start one because they don't know what to do yeah so that that's what's part of our mission so i am not going to your craftsmanship conference in germany and my mission i start saying talking about the communities and what we're doing and they had no community and but then after speaking to lots of people five of them put themselves forward so like we want to learn more and then i

ran an open space sharing or everything that we've done and some people said on and all slots for me but a few of them said oh I'd love to do that so they got together they put in the map where they lived in Germany so how they could recognize that assembly I've me a medal exactly so then they asked lots of questions and stuff certain things will work for them sort of things you

probably want and then the exact to do it so that our queue comments that just started one community is starting sorry one is immune 'ok one is in a city that never I comp another name and there is one in Frankfort starting on the third of December they will have their code retreat in the global day of course okay so that would be their kickoff meeting

it's a great way to kick off up something that's a progressive chip group and so that was Germany and and then because we were tweeting about the whole thing communities and helping people and the guys there blogged about mention my name of Lucifer a guy in various contacted me yeah so look I was following the twitter and suck so I would love to dinner Contreras would you

help me so of course let me spend a few weeks exchanging emails i was sharing with him like everything that we've done how it done also and then he invited me over to do a kickoff talk in his community and in the first meeting they had like 15 five people turning up and now just a month and a half later they have a hundred different tribe members right I think these kinds of stories are

fascinating where you have an idea and you just want to sit down and you're like hey I'm going to do something fun and then it's just flourishes and then you know like a like a flower with pollen it goes off and then next you know there's their seeds of groups forming in other in other areas just because of they see you doing something cool and then they want to do something

cool too it's absolutely amazing I hear things like that so yeah there is this guy's room from Israel it's a great guy called urologic heroes the Israeli soccer coach Chip community he runs it in a slightly different way then we ran hours in terms of community thing but he's doing a great job there and he has like 690 members like that it's probably the largest commit that I know buddy but

he doesn't have the monthly event is more like ad hoc advance oh he's doing really well he's a great great guy yeah so and then walking dummy we set up a Google Group so I invited order the community leaders in Europe and then we have now our group it's too they cannot work because it's very recent stuff so that's where we are today and then hopefully

here in the US we meeting people like yourself and all the other guys make this connection with the American yeah instance the word we're here now seeing and it's it's great getting to sit down and meet and talk with so many other huge group leaders but you know so we're just going to go ahead and wrap it up now Thank You Sandra your knowledge Tom appreciate it very much as tears

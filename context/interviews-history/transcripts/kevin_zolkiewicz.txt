hi i'm mike i'm here at Windy City rails day to sending here actually with Kevin djokovic who is one of the organizers for Wendy see the rails and in between sessions he's taking a little bit of time to talk with us about why he's involved Windy City relson and how did you actually get involved with mini city rails I started working at wisdom group about six years ago and at the time we

were like a we did mostly computer networking stuff and dealing with servers a little bit of web not too much and then at that point rails was maybe like two years old so ray who you know president was in group he tells a story often how it just one day I told him such a meager this thing called Ruby unreal yeah and you know we sort of had a lot of interest in it Ray was really

excited about it and everything started with Chicago Ruby mmm-hmmm so we we were looking for you know is there any good meetups in the Chicago area we started Chicago Ruby originally in the suburbs and we expand it downtown and the idea of you know why why isn't there a Ruby on Rails conference in Chicago so we figured what we could just do something simple will do a one-day conference on

saturday and you know see how it goes from there yeah it's what the suture know pretty well now it's yeah this is our fifth year or now a two-day conference yeah and I'm really excited about the progress that we've made so you know going from a one-day conference to a two-day conference I mean is it is it literally twice the effort for for organization and getting everybody

together or you know it wasn't as bad as I thought because yeah there's some we do need to get more speakers but as lovely as the conference's got more well-known it's been easy for us to just go up to people and say hey you want to see everybody cityrail sure it's a known point yeah so and most of the administrative stuff doesn't duplicate for us one of the big things that I need

to make sure I handle the first day is registration making sure we have badges for everybody but I'm the second day you know most people have already been here the first day so there's this baby yeah makes a few people maybe show up on the second day but it's the second is a lot simpler for us so and you know just going back to the user group aspect of it you know

when you when you decided to create you're looking for Caesar already wasn't easy good from what you described but you decided to kind of create your own where the world wasn't was there anything going on with it was originally in downtown Chicago there was the scherb I'll give group and there was a a groupon meet up that we sort of came across that was running like I think it

was like around maybe in forest park around that area in the suburbs so the person who was organizing that decided to you know he wasn't you know able to devote as much time to it so we figure okay well we'll take that over and then eventually over time there was some organizational changes going on at sure and we decided to merge the groups together and make one large group so now

we have our main downtown meeting but we still do a meeting in the suburbs a month as well and I are you are you guys is like just different leadership and you just like coordinate with each other for meetings or like is it is it the same people running this downtown and the Chicago version uh we kind of split it up so we got a great couple d and Tracy canal who are doing most of our

cigarette meetings now and then we've got a core group of people who handle our downtown meetings so just you know finding speakers running you know the operations of it which for Buckley a monthly meeting is a lot simpler to the conference we do like to record all of our conferences and get video out there so you know we make sure we have somebody who's recording and edit

uploading okay cool and on as far as like the difference between you can set it's a lot easier to run up a monthly meeting versus conference because I mean you have he said you have the audio video I mean that the rig that they have setup is pretty intense yeah and but but I mean you guys have kind of established kind of a rhythm though also I mean it's just the faith you can do it so many

times like what each year do you usually have the same people working you out so you can just kind of have a union yeah we're really lucky to have people who are very talented and what they do so we've got really talented AV people really talented IT I mean this new venue ER and is very nice but it presented a huge challenge to us in terms of internet because at the time this place

only had like a 1 megabit internet connection and for 270 software developers yeah that wouldn't work out so we we had to do some crazy stuff with microwave internet signals and getting tons of extra equipment yeah to get like a really reliable internet connection criteria is that something you set up temporarily for the conference or is that something that's going to be here I

don't know the exact specifics i know we have equipment that we just sort of set up on the fly okay but i think there's some bits of infrastructure that will make it a little bit easy for us next year yeah but yeah that was one of our big challenges this year don't know that's interesting we havin sure they do some actual technical innovation just funny because we're actually a lot of

technical people you need to be surprised that but I know that's really great so as far as the user group do you have a lot of people that come from the user group do you see a lot of people in the audience here today that you've also seen at user group meetings is your seem to be like if you've gone to really see where else you probably also go to subscribe to

Ruby and vice versa or is it do you see a different type of audience coming to the two different yeah I mean there's a lot of familiar faces that I see here from the monthly events but I mean we get tons of additional people for this as well so I mean most of our meetups have grown lately we usually get at least a hundred people now in our downtown one and you know and just maybe

a year or two ago our average was closer to 50 so those are growing and then you know we get this year we had 274 Windy City rails so a lot of it is people who have been the Chicago ruby and then there's sometimes with other people as well there maybe they're not involved in Chicago ruby but then they attend Windy City rails they hear about it and then maybe to stop by the meetings yeah and

with 700 people and regularly at a meeting that's almost like a mini conference every month to be don't of itself I I mean is it the same people coming to those as well or do you see a lot of turnover in that those that the regular attendees you see a lot which is it you sing a lot of regular attendees month after month after month or is it are you seeing new people coming in all

the time ya mean I'm always saying new faces there i mean there's usually a few people that i always recognized here there every month but yeah I mean there's people who look Tom one month and maybe they'll skip a month or two and an hour are we have our meetup organized to meetup com and I think our numbers are like at 1700 registered people this part of the Chicago ruby

meetup there so I mean we don't get all of those people I mean some of them if they signed up three years ago and they never came the meeting but you know we definitely get a good people each month I come out of that pool attended meetings yeah it just looking back at all the years I mean I just say windy city rail is one of my top conferences Sen a chicago code camp

because I'm affiliated with ads but when he see residents one that I come to you almost every year since the second year or every year since the second year um do you have a favorite like moments from account you know one of these conferences that like wow that really was something neat and special that happened at the conference it was some you remember previous years well I mean

we've had a lot of good speakers come true to the years I mean the improv that we had yesterday was pretty great we previewed that at one of our earlier conferences this year so it's nice to see that scale with a large audience and I just love being at a conference and seeing people getting together and meeting people and communicating with each other because I mean that's at the

end of the day it's really what this is all about I mean we get speakers here to give these talks but it's the networking that people really enjoy yeah and you know that's what we try the foster by making sure we have plenty of opportunities for people to meet people well again thank you Kevin for sure time to speak no problem

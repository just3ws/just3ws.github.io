hi i'm mike epps to being out here with the guys from refreshed chicago jianshe tell me hi guys thanks for sitting down with me today the kind of question that we're going to get to you is tell me a little bit about refreshed Chicago what are you doing here what is what what is the freshest Wrigley yeah I'm refreshing so refresh Chicago we've been around for I think almost tuning help that two and

a half and it it's sort of read the Refresh group itself is sort of a loose collection of groups around the country it started its not just here to sadness here in Chicago it's around the country they're not really affiliated with each other they share a common the original goal was to be a way to meet up and sort of talk about new ideas that we're coming into web development which was

like a refresh web standard CSS so we realized that there was sort of there was no refresh group in Chicago it was sort of we're trying to fill this gap which is bringing web designers and web developers together common topics that yeah because we you see a lot of tech my heart there was a child but nothing really disturbing yeah designer you I yeah I mean when you think about

web design it's good it is technical and it's it's creative and it's it's designed but it's all the other things sort up together right you can it's messy too like there's not one and then Harvard kind of fills that void you know it's not just like tag it's not just creative it's it's everything and some weeks it makes more sense to serve people in some ways it makes more sense

to others but I think that's sort of the niche that we so giving that you're kind of balance people who have may be very different ways of defining what you do you have like a lot of Schmucks I think we're kind of lucky i think our membership but i think it's at like 1,300 feet or so I'm getting out so we keep a steady number but but we're seeing different basis there's there's

the people who show up regularly but we do see a lot of different base is coming which i think is actually a benefit to the group because you're going to be new people every time when you come which is something that's pretty unique for this group and also a lot of a defender of the speaker to write like that speaker development heavy we tend to get warm ago rails crowd and development

you know there's always quite a bit and our goal I think our goal overall is to sort of have have our members attend talks that they're not necessarily comfortable with or like you know like yeah give them some experience in some area that they don't necessarily know you guys have done some stuff with start off because I had associated refresh I think it's just like a natural side of

that up to market that we touch you know in Chicago it's kind of different startup culture or creative culture and they're a lot more entwined here I think so out of that we get speakers you were naturally par to startups and things of that nature and it it just kind of falls out of that so it's kind of like a natural evolution for us so how much your schedule yeah

so I'd helped us out with the space what are the plans for the future which this month but I get we brought a few because I'm thirteen hundred members you got a large penis through yeah we're looking to we are actively partnering with another company to throw a conference in the fall we go large web conference that covers when say you're working at Chicago where

haha Chicago web com some deadlines to the last year okay the show yeah we're teaming up with them to basically both partner on it okay for you so I'll make sure put that sounds good aye sir anything else you'd like to say if I'm refresh I would say if you haven't come out yet that's always an awesome thank Jim that's what we more ideas well thank you very much for

tsunami fortune meeting

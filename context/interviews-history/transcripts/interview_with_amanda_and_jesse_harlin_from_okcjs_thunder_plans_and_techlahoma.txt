hi it's mike with you tastic I'm sitting down with Jesse and Amanda with the tech Lahoma and thunder planes our communities in Oklahoma thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me so Thunder planes in tech lahoma those are that's a conference in an organization for helping I user groups can you tell me a little bit about those sure which would you like to hear about

first and let's go with thunder planes okay um well so yeah always interrupt yes absolutely so the new planes its developers conference this is going to be our second one that we're doing and it will be on October night at the Cox Convention Center and Oklahoma City countin Thunder planes was born of community interest it started with the Oklahoma City JavaScript user group

really wanting to see a conference that was relevant to the interests of the people that were attending right so JavaScript obviously played a very large part in it but it was an exclusively limits to that we have speakers on SAS and general software development phonegap and verve the postgres as well and it was generally really successful I think that people really had a good time

and learned a lot and so pretty much at the end it was like well you know did you like this should we do this again community was like yes like more of that so here we are we're doing it again we had the call for submissions edited quite some time ago and we haven't released the speakers yet we're waiting a little bit of information back from the contacts we have the cox convention

center to find out you know what the most optimal way to organize the tracks and stuff are but there will be more than a plain top calm in your future about that cool that's the short answer I believe it or not that's perfect in the technical ma was faded from the need for helping with chopped communities so Jesse myself Rob silvana me and secrets are involved in that what we've done so

far is went to your upcoming groups like a Python we've been trying to help up to people my signal group to and but we also like to see more is no bomb so by sharing our experiences because you all to pray yeah a lot of the folks that are involved I've been running user groups in the area and we noticed that without any sort of nexus for communication user groups can

sometimes become completely inadvertently to sort of information silos and stuff like that and furthermore if you have to kind of a bend back attendee every single user group is certainly a modern lot of overlap so firstly it facilitates a lot of cross communication between the groups which is very nice it also helps make sure that no one's kind of left out

you know if we have very logistical things like chairs and a location and like a projector and stuff like that be we want to try and share resources as we can so no matter what the topic is it can be they can be successful so that's what we've been doing so far and I so I mean are you working with a couple different user groups or yeah that's right um so currently the Python user

group the Ruby user group JavaScript use your group and javelin a Java user group have all been kind of like okay yeah there you can kind of under the check Lahoma almost a sit under the tech Lahoma umbrella that's not the right way they've been kind of banding together in a more kind of flat way yeah well the family the network then look they not know um and uh it's been going really

well and one of the most awesome things as we've also been able to reach out to be hardware and the sort of DIY hacking community in Oklahoma City which previously was you know again there were some members in both but the communication has gone way up there's a location called prototype that opened recently that a lot of the hardware DIY people and also interesting that the

infosec people are frequenting pretty regularly and now the software people are and it's working we're really excited about it yeah it's great to see that you know a local community in Chicago that's I'm in Chicago and it's frustrating sometimes seeing meetings happening on the same night for similar audiences I remember I remember myself con am I going to the vim meet up or am

I going to the ruby meetup because they're at the same night and they both had good top but and then the rest of the week there was nothing so they've gone on a different day people could possibly for gone to both and participated in in both are you are you helping with that kind of communication the Python group wanted to start meeting and had no idea what

kind dates they should think of so on to coloma we have whenever the user to me like okay CJ s means i'm a third tuesday we said maybe try not to meet on for tuesday yeah you're at like I do in three different dates when you can choose and they picked one of them um be my signal group is really mad but I'm like hey look what it helped you write and there's a few other logistical

things for example all the groups that are involved in tacoma all adopted a like a code of conduct for instance right which is something that unfortunately a lot of groups don't think about but it's a big deal right there again trying to coordinate dates and stuff like that there you know using community resources but generally they're just also just talking to each

other which is a very very deal and we're also trying our very best to you know we're based in oklahoma city but we have a pretty good working relationship with Tulsa as well and we're also trying to make sure that these bridges work and also communicate with other regional groups as well so that's still still simmering but we want people to meet other people who share their interests

this is very important and that happens everything kind of policy so so far so good has it has it been not helpful in reaching more audience on I mean has there been any feedback from say the Python the group saying oh we had three people come last month because we were in the Ruby group um I noticed one time that the Java group wasn't actually really public meeting their

announcements it's about an email but of course from the newsletter are going to know so I took it upon us to tweet as a PCGS for the Java group and I got some tweets back like hey thanks guys I wouldn't gone had I not seen this to me so I'm lahoma is going to helping with that too it's just nice we can help promote other groups and we sure speaker is because we're all gonna polyglots

here right okay yes we say especially if you're doing JavaScript you tend to be in a different spots it has one thing that's been really helpful is it turns out and just by the nature but it is a lot of folks from very different backgrounds were attending the JavaScript user group you know there were server-side programs were picking

up clients I things that were I guess x flash developers there are people who are not yet designers and stuff like that so you know you did like a hardcore computer science like you know but they need also have someone who was you know study design stuff like that so it was a good kind of I want to say like starting point for a lot of this to kind of go out and like spread out to the other

areas just just by nature of what that particular group had so there was a Venn diagram that i mentioned that would be like a lot of intersection would be on top of that particular thing but for what you're asking just in terms of just pure sort of like word of mouth factor attendant all across the board has generally gone up as a result people were just sort of their of more groups

yeah just by getting them talking they're interested in things like you know you may be a c-sharp developer but a lot of C sharp shops have great files that they're using so they might start attending Ruby in Lund picking up on that you might have Python involved in your deployment in reality attending just one group is not really you know it doesn't necessarily make sense you're

going to touch a lot of different things yeah and they know this so they're following student or any more things I know this is a little helpful for other states and some funds completed pop by midwest at work which is a big community calendar end and you sharing speakers across states seeing one of the people out to what they need help with or if they have same problems or same goals as

us it's really nice yeah and so this has also been kind of probably interesting for you as well guinea to touch all these different communities has it it it kind of has it had a change the way you perceived what Cal community works from before she started doing this stuff yeah it did and one way is a way I didn't expect um I used to really that kind of more smaller communities

was a good thing right we have a number to suburbs around here you'd have like a code more and echoed Morgan and a cadet minimus that but I'm actually changing that belief that really kind of coming together to a sort of a nexus is the right thing to do it has anything that reduces insular behavior is generally better for everyone across the whole group it creates more connections and

stuff like that the downside is if there is a downside is it you have to kind of get out of your safety net a little bit you have to travel I don't know if you know much about Oklahoma City in particular but the way that it was designed it kind of sprawls out a lot so driving is just sort of a reality it's difficult to be a survivable pedestrian so you know we're asking a lot of holes

we lived in weatherford for a while which is literally a one hour drive outside of Oklahoma City so we drive an hour every single time we wanted to go a tender around a user group and so we're actually starting to see more folks make the drive which is which is good because they might literally have more Drive yeah I don't one took me a second but I got it from phone so I'm and I have how

much or how about yourself have you has there been a change in perspective from before you started working more with different communities some people need see bogard you're offering to help me a volunteer for the conference and then I got to help with another job for conference and I got to help with user groups in and it's mean it really found for outreach is just gained two new

people looking inside your own TV people wanting to grow on dad you can't do it alone basically be an officer country corners yes yeah it's a club but it's it's it's it's it's very inclusive yeah well you know there's there's also the JSC q5 dev I'm just curious what what is cq5 I didn't mean that so I'm is this really enterprise a CMS it's originally my day but adobe model so

that's what I do it work it's now being repackaged ATM do the experience manager Sarah that's cool that's like I thought it might be another I got another like on the JSC q5 conference I was think it was like conference key or something like that that's funny no okay well not it sounds like you've got some really interesting things going on down in in in Oklahoma and it's sound like the

pains you're feeling and describing of something I've kind of heard echoed in a few other communities is how do we get these people talking and I see like I don't know if you look at the Germany community they have a they have I'm not even going to try to pronounce it but i will link to it they have a it's it's a kind of a similar thing to what you're describing with oklahoma where they're

trying to support other user group communities in the in the cities around them and and get them talking and sharing information and it's kind of what i want to do with yuga list as well that's what I'm building towards us to help all these networks be aware of each other yeah you can see all the Ogallala groups on Nicholas yeah yeah fact that human being us right now is proof that

you're very prompt in cheating your goal oh yeah it yeah that's right yeah not it and it's it's it's uh you know I'll just go ahead and I'll talk a little bit usually I don't talk that much during the interviews but the more people I talk to you they're involved in technical technical communities it's kind of this I see the same thing this is what you described where you said

you're in an area and you see a bunch of disparate communities that aren't really talking to each other and aren't aware of the day exist so you're trying to make them aware and I was trying to do a little bit that here in Chicago but as I talk to more and more people outside of Chicago I found out that there was other people there's a like I said there's this guy at his at Benjamin I'll just

say that that's his Twitter handle you okay yeah so he's he's over in Germany and he's helping to connect people and and then there's yourself and I'm trying to find people like yourselves who are trying to connect and build networks and then try to help connect them as well there's also the interviews that I'm posting right now from go to conf and I'll try to connect you with them as

well I'd because they're the one thing that the go to calm people is that does that's interesting as they when they go into a location to do a conference they reach out and they find the people in the community and they bring them together and then they start doing local events called go two nights and they basically will bring in speakers to talk it and a centralized event so it would

be something like it wouldn't be just part of you know the JSP top or the ruby meetup it would be a go-to night but it would be inviting people from all of those communities bringing them together for a night for like a kind of a mini micro conference and it's just you know there's all these different cool ideas going on about how to put these networks together and it just sounds like what

you're doing is really really moving in in that direction so it's very cool to see currently there was a recipe infrastructure is probably one of most things like yeah one of the biggest challenges of nervous we were meeting in a place and ended up going away and like we had but for the JavaScript user we had five months in a row that every single time is in a different location

right and it's really challenging for members to just kind of keep up with its already drinking through fire hose for their day job with everything so on top of that you're moving the furniture but you know have a place to stay you have the gear you need chairs projector stuff like that a lot of these like seemingly locating logistical concerns are things that serve big challenges for groups if

you're trying to start where it's all right people slide I like such and such and we gotta meet oh my gosh everyone charging us a lot of money or in a width of time parking is bad it's harm pro getting those barriers out of the way definitely step in the right direction no matter where you yeah and again with with having that a centralized location our centralized group where people that

are maybe interested in starting up a meet up in in Oklahoma if they start googling they find you oh I you have connections that might be able to tell them I'll go to this place they they host user group meetings and now don't take care of most year your needs and then they can just focus on starting their community which is which is where the value is hopefully the folks are and

of course every community in every area now sees the folks who are no really actively participating to text act blogs and stuff like that you hope that you know present we have a blog realm where people are air interactive you can go find their material and vice versa so hopefully you're asking like an angularjs question you end up you know working away into a tech lahoma and

hiring a whole bunch of things that are relevant to your interest so it goes both ways as they become more successful in the community helps them it actually is like a feedback movement it's really positive so just a danica ya know it's it's all about building up these connections between people well again thank you very much for taking the time to sit down and chat with me appreciate

it thanks user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in that tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yeah you cast a calm you

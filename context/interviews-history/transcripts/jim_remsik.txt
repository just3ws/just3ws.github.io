hi I'm Mike I'm here windy city rails on behalf of you tastic I'm standing here with Jim REM zyk who does medicine Ruby and the UX mad um so Jim thanks for for taking the time to talk with me my pleasure Madison ruby has been on the lips of everybody a group on this past a couple weeks so can you tell everybody a little bit about what is medicine Ruby sure so Madison Ruby woo was the event

that I wanted to go to we had a couple of goals we wanted to introduce the Ruby community to madison and we've had several people say wow Madison maybe we locate and but also introduce Madison to the Ruby community because there were a ton of people that I knew from attending conferences that were awesome people and we just wanted to introduce the Madison people with them sort of give them

involved in the community okay and you know earlier I heard heard that you engage the actual Chamber of Commerce in ba and so you try to make it like way beyond just developer conference so to some degree yes we we want to bring in people who are interested in Ruby and entertain them and give them things that to take away that showcase their passion and and inspire them and really that it

wasn't really a goal going in but the single most word that I've used here describe this year's conference was people came away inspired which was you know for the moon to hear that yeah yeah so I it seems to have kind of a tad formats almost it seemed like yada that I remember seen pictures of big carpeting and a stage so there's a three psychiatrically yeah it's a playhouse

theatre and it's a three-sided stage which is just fantastic because from the center of the stage I don't think that you're more than like 15 feet from any individual person in the theater okay so it's a very intimate theater we do shorter talks we only do 30 minutes we actually had some 20 minute talks us here and we don't do only Ruby we don't do only technic

and so this year we happen to have two legendary drummers wait Clyde Stubblefield who's James Brown's drummer and we had Martin Atkins who's a legendary punk drummer been in little bands like ministry new face killing joke yeah small saw me yeah and so yeah that's what what was kind of the goal there i mean it's simple and so this year it happened to be drummers not

because we sought out drummers just because those were the people that we found locally we have a since our first conference we've always included a local flavor session which is we wanted to showcase Madison and so we had the first year we had a chocolatier cheese maker and brewer unfortunately didn't show up but we wanted to showcase people that are in Madison who are passionate about

what they do and that are doing awesome things so I can't get can't get much more passionate than the Martin Atkins and Clyde Stubblefield and they just came in and they're entertainers and they killed their their sessions so so as they come in they talk about bringing passion to what you do or we're trying to because well I would imagine is there there were great artists but also they

do the same thing day in day out whereas we'd like to imagine that we're creating art or we are being creative in our industry but we do a day in and day out is it was that kind of yeah so particularly with those two we just said you know come in and tell us why you do what you do and you know Clyde told more of a story about how he you know started out playing two sticks on a trash can

lid and how he got to where he is today and a Martin a little bit more entertaining but he has a you know how to how to do what you do and be successful at it and you know it's a little more entrepreneurial from a little bit yeah so he actually has a book called luck and music welcome to the music business your left yeah I don't know who your

audiences yeah yeah it's Fiji alright so but I'd like to describe that book as a a punk bra getting real from 37signals but you know from the from the perspective of a punk drummer yeah excuse yet peaceful people think about what they create the music the plane but there's a lot that goes in it's like running a conference it's like business yeah right so a punk band is a small

business and he has been successful for a number of years to you know multiple iterations and it just a lot of common sense stuff they like oh right you know that makes a ton of sense why didn't I think of that sometimes the common sense it just has to kind of snap you in the face though team absolute for it to come through so and what is what does UX mad yo ex mad is a user experience

conference this is something that we actually we had a person living with us who is a user experience expert and he said when i finished my booklet suucks conference the book never got finished but we said we want to do another best anyway exactly so it's really bringing in user experience which is a really hard question to answer what it is but you know it's it's everything from you

know we we took the aspect of web user experience so everything from page load time look and feel content to you know do things function correctly all those play a role in user experience and so our goal was to sort of put on a awesome front end conference and again people didn't really know what to expect a thing from that conference but everybody left with great feedback so what would

be I mean you know designers have very different goals and different at least my experience have different mentality towards their work then programmers do what you know run into different conferences that are targeting is very least what I would perceive to be very different audiences what is you know been some of the trade-offs what has

worked with one but maybe not work for the other well I mean at the end of the day there's still people and there are people who care about what they do those are the type of people that we're looking to draw in so it's not it's not terribly hard to say okay you know put it in this bubble and then frame it in the context of a person who cares about what they do it is definitely definitely

differences we have karaoke for the designers okay which probably would run at a ruby conference but know how much how much beer would have been consumed though before you would work at a ruby conference maybe we're the brewer that sure that would we actually saw that's I do want to say that that's stereotyping that there are plenty of karaoke people in the in the Ruby community but um you

know those people just seem a little bit more extroverted so but I mean we did focus on it we had the after party for UX mad at a Children's Museum oh really just so interactive and one of my favorite one of my favorite highlights from UX mad was we had rock band set up we had an entire children's museum full of exhibits for people who play with I go in the back room and there's 20

people sitting around a kid size table drawing with crayons yeah it just is fantastic yeah you know the madison ruby conference you know again it's just about people who care about what they do happen to be focused on Ruby so there are definitely differences they're largely back-end focused not always but yeah okay um what thank you very much for taking the time to see me

appreciate it cheers

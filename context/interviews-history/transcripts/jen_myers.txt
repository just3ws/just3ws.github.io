hi i'm mike with you Tessa come here again at SCA I'm sitting down with Jen wire from relevance and she is a weird designer you're a digital native designer and you come to speak to technical audiences uh programmers and developers and um excuse me and also uh you speak it at the sutton to designers i'm sure that or i believe that there's probably a big difference between those

two audiences what is it that you you see any difference when you speak to them oh there's some differences and I'm definitely personally more comfortable in the techie community for lack of a better and better term that's kind of where I had started nuts are I feel most at home honestly honestly when I go speak to designers I feel a little bit kind of on the other side of things

because I do spend so much time in the technical alley is gay but there is definitely differences i think a lot of the designers that i know i had a lot of people who were in the ux community which was kind of almost a sub so the larger design community and you know they have they work with different mediums and some of them are you know product designers but it's still very

interesting to be able to find the common ground then between things sometimes just takes a little bit more work to figure out what designers perspective and what medium they lurk in and where they're coming from and then find the common ground we don't feel I do have to do that as much but in the tech community and I do think the designers to tend to on that they have a

listen to see a larger sense of a lot of things not to say that tech people you know are narrow-minded or anything but that's not that at all but I think designers just tend to have a very large sense of everything um so and then that always helps even if they're not very techincal I can kind of find some common ground and what they what they are passionate about what they do and

connect it to what I do and do that and that's that's the main thing with designers when you say a broader sense do you mean that they're looking at the design and how their design interacts where maybe developers just like oh how do I make this design work with this app I think I think that could be I could um I'm not sure exactly what it is honestly it's just kind of an impression that I

get and I think that designers tend to their they just really do like to have the large pictures I'd like to know how everything fits together and I'm like that and that son there's one thing I do like to talk to developers I feel sometimes it's easy to get wrapped up in little things and details are important but it's really important for me to have larger context some things I think

that's something I bring as a designer having a context and doing how things fit in and that's the same whether you know you're actually doing that in a product or you're dealing with the community you have two managers perspectives just a jumping what I introduced you as a digital native what is it what does that mean that's the term that I just started to coin

actually isn't and I never heard anybody else use it but it was a way that I'm using to describe myself because I am a designer worked as a designer in software but I don't have a formal design background so I didn't we're going to come from a print background and then learning to do I learned design by learning HTML back in there 2001 sings oh that so you started I started

in a digital landscape and so everything that I've learned about design theory have learned about you know design principles but since I'm always working in a digital medium all those principles I've always applied you know digitally not to to print or things like that and I have done some print projects but actually current projects are more of a struggle for me because I'm used to

working additional things like it's why doesn't this Saturday I get really nervous if I make something for print and like I can't change it afterwards or I can't change it down the road it's a completely different process completely different medium but and you can't do it the principles are the same it's just about learning that medium and that's the thing with I like the idea of a

digital native does are in this field because those are designers to understand how a design works in this medium and all the specific you know implementations and needs and possibilities is there anything that when you go in you're talking to a technical programmer audience that is easy it's particularly hard to get across that maybe as

developers were just not quite a tune enough to some concept or idea that you see maybe as you go to one conference after another this one just just doesn't click for some reason you know honestly there really isn't I have really good experiences all-union developers universally every I've talked about this topic many conferences and I always have developers come and talk to me and they

asked me like how can I learn it there's a lot of them feel that they can't but I don't think there's any one thing would be holding I've never seen anything across the boards like you know they're not getting this it's just a matter of not knowing where to start really which has nothing to do with them it's about you know how we're educating people and sharing information and that's one of

the reasons and my talk I talk about how designers need to be more explicit and be more clear so that developers understand this but mostly Oh in fact you pretty much universally all the developers that I've talked to developers are work with are really interested in learning these things on their own I think the only thing holding them back is not knowing exactly where

to start which hopefully is something that I can I can work on helping and other you know digital designers can work on putting resources out there because we could certainly use a little bit more usability and a little bit more just make it look nicely and that Islam if you spoken like it a software craftsmanship North America is a will become a polyglot it's not wanting

platform but working in a real he may be spoken of any real specific learning any that specific or any any specific technology I am smoking a specific conferences although most Ruby conferences that I have spoken out are very open in two things i have not spoken at anything else specific although i have spoken at other polygon conferences that tend toward more

towards net more towards things like that so there's a wide range of programmers but honestly the same i still have the same experience is the same common ground the interest in learning at least a little bit of designs yeah well the question I was going to give that though for yellow destructive as well was that there seems to be a signature style into each one of

those that did you kind of know that dot Nets Microsoft platform because it's got its own design influences versus something like iOS which is you know that if this is Matt all right but and anything the rails community kind of see a certain Stalin now with bootstrap that's any you know I mean I have to admit even on my own side its its its bootstrapping it's easy and it takes me

a long way I maybe is that something that's all I is that something to concerns you that maybe they're starting to be like this or or is that um maybe a good thing that there's these signature styles that are shutting down merge for these two guys it's really concern me I think I think it's okay i will stop short of saying boots dresses the solution for everything but no and

actually i had conversation with somebody yesterday or as going to make a new joke but he's describing a situation where like you know honestly in that particular circumstance it makes sense you to do that that's what I feel that there are just different solutions for different problems and I think as long as you know they're still kind of going back to that design foundation or that

you're still in touch with you know the collaborative process and that there are still people involved in this you're making deliberate decisions I think that's where it really comes down to is we have standards that we're not thinking about and that's true for whatever discipline is the same thing in design and design and development if you're just doing things on thinking

like because that's what everybody does that's obviously probably not the best thing to do I have the animated gif great yeah if it doesn't sparkle but there is you know there are some things where even if it may not be the ideal solution in every case in some cases it makes sense to do that in different languages there are things that make more sense than others so developing

solutions specifically for them i don't think is a bad thing as long as we're continuing to think deliberately about them well thank you very much for sitting down thank you

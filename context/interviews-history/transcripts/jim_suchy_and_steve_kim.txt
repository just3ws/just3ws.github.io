we started back in January when we took it from activa yeah the idea is Chicago software craftsmanship will have not necessarily speakers for the talks but hands-on sessions that people can't engage with and participate right so like most other talks all the places are religious talk every lots of constitutions your human labs trying to worry sessions and things like carrot

and or sessions TV sessions sparring this competition to it right and like what when you see spy mode even as far code competition okay so our first meeting we had like leave a session where can serve a running at people codons you to see we're actually here for a meeting and we are in the middle of the walking area but we will continue so here she had a code competition what

was it was an ant so you control the Nanta popscreen and there's a simple rest in the eye your aunt okay and then you could come son of mine I just click on make it differently exactly morwen and so like one when your meeting is typically we decided on the second wednesday of the month but it's definitely flexible i mean depending on our session not necessarily speak sort

of the leader where is now is reversing cleaners yes'm like today it's it's a Java session potentially you guys share responsibility for my new group or how do you how do you guys manage coordinating audio files so you guys a meetup site now we have a wonderful spreadsheet that we use it looks yeah I took very attractive and that's what we've been using Emmys what does rate

with you so much that's not a lot we would be able to shirk responsibility it gets too steep so the only take care of the script ooh that's cool and I so it's a fine and do you have anybody need it you know that your weapon upbringing in or reviews is this something that's wholly owned by a fight or is this still like community just so happen it's still mistress the community so now

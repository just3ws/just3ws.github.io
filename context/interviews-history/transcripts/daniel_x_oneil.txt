hi it's Mike again with you tastic today I'm sitting down with Daniel X O'Neill well you might know him as a poet and a playwright and a little bit of his work that he's done with the open governments and you know a few little things he's right now he's the executive director of the smart Chicago collaborative and also has been to the White House is a champion of change for the work he's

done with open government Dana thanks for taking the time to sit down all right good to see you mine so I have a shot as a poet in an artist go to become the man in injured in that in the in this in the suit as I dead sprint commercial hahaha I'm gonna stick it to the man yeah yeah you are the man some second to myself right so I've been sticking it to myself for a while how

did I go from being a poet playwright to to where I am now I guess I don't see it as crazy and circus of a path as it seems in the late 80s and early 90s I was a part of the spoken word poetry scene in chicago and around the country i did a lot of Tours and and i wrote books and you know my mission my completely silly mission was to become the worldwide

entertainment jug amount of the 21st century Jericho I'm gigantic owes my handle and a lot of different places although it's too difficult the story so I've moved to mean your degree was English in anthropology how do you go from being very much creative and expressive to what is now focused on technology mm-hmm well I think that you know I did get a degree in English

anthropology from university law in Chicago and again I don't see it is that wild of a path anthropology's of his you know focus on the study of man study of human beings and why they do things and I'm in English you know help certainly helped me as a poet but it's just any time you have to communicate with people in any job you did right so I don't see it as that goofy and then also I do

continue it through in a number of ways i'm really interested in the archaeology of technology and the recent history of Technology and even like the current you know a sort of explication of why websites or technology use are the way they are often will see kind of how did we get here yeah why did we make it that way right there's always a reason there's always a reason for every

feature that's in every piece of software and sometimes it can be a very idiosyncratic thing and well even if you look at just something as simple as the the style of website design of the last 10 years and how it's morphed and changed and then s so that I presume a very cosmetic level I think we're the bootstrapping eat right now that's the

uh oh for websites yeah well he would strap yeah yeah peanut boots trip you know where and again why because it has utility and because you know there's so much focus on mobile design and it's such a great way to do it yeah we used to be in the age of typepad right that was you know you know in that in the early 2000s the right hand to have column you know every that was it yeah

they have it just like that and when blogger first came out it was you know probably the first time that CSS really got a huge bump and then everybody started using CSS and everything got better and part of the archaeology of that I used to be a lurker on the w3c accessibility list in the late 90s and early 2000s it was all very radical accessibility advocates who were trying

to figure out what standards that could be for designing websites that met the needs of people with disabilities their strength or derision all the saw yeah and ended up that the output of that was CSS they thought they were talking about how to make websites accessible for people with disabilities in fact they were making standards for making better websites right here in and also making

3d and shadows and all kinds of something it sounds like we're on caps okay so you went from from being kind of about having a mind that's trying to understand why things the way they are how did that lead to you getting involved in in the data front like most things it's it's a goofy path so as a writer and graduating with a degree english anthropologist natural path

would be to be a copywriter for ad firms which would have been death for me because that's a disastrous path at least as far as I'm concerned no offense even though I just said something offensive anyway um but for you it were made some other people find joy exactly exactly maybe I don't know so what I did was I became a paralegal I got out of college and I spent six years as a

litigation paralegal and I learned a lot about business okay because you can learn a lot about it's like a long internship around how what happens when everything gets all fucked up it goes to hell okay that's things tend to they can go to hell and then I've learned that they go to hell when you don't communicate because I was the person I was a paralegal going through hundreds

of thousands of documents trying to figure out you know how the personnel could matter got completely screwed up and how a person was discriminated against and I when you say they didn't communicate I had to wonder did it ever feel like when you're watching a movie and you want to say why didn't the actor just say that thing to the other person and it would have just saved the entire

two hours and then it would be any drama yeah then it would have been no monkey and I was a giant robots or anything or or lawsuits yeah people messing other people up so and I guess the reason is because of you know humans are pretty deeply flawed and creatures so I did that and then to make more money I did copy writing on the side I did marketing copywriting I did it brochure for the

world book cd-rom in 1995 and I think I probably had that it was difficult on below the packard bell and i had it oh it was a blockbuster yeah thing you know click on to discovery laughing along those lines video are bad is it yeah it did and that was the first time I did anything member back then it was the age of interactive it's not about websites yeah or the World Wide Web it was about

interactive experiences so and I in that I'm just doing a lot of copywriting for marketing firms design firms and the night sort of became a project manager for those things cuz end up writing a copy and then designers can tend to be a little flaky kind of focused on the are pretty yeah and then it'd be like okay cool so you're gonna print this right now I kind of printer and yeah so i

started doing like you know management and project man for those kinds of races and then broke into just naturally in nineteen ninety eight ish just got into the web because that's where you know it was an incredibly growing field so I'm then working in the web and technology since since the middle of night did you he didn't get started with IPO cities or did you go straight to via I was not a

practitioner haha i have to say until maybe about two thousand one because after a couple years of doing the project management i realized that you know really smart programmers and really good designers they'll snow you you know when you try to say as a project manager like listen can you do this and you put this air all not possible yeah i can't do that with this technology so i wanted

to find out you know what we can watch what could what I could do so I started messing around with salon blogs that was my first blog that was the same time that the julie julia blog was going on ended up being the making I don't recall that one but yeah it was this woman Julie who was blogging about doing one recipe every day oh oh the UH with the Julia Child yes yeah really

Julia project okay and she was at one of the blogs on salon okay I i had another blog on salon called google myths that took what i did was i copy pasted the obituaries interesting obituaries from ok times and then i would do lynx-o just hyperlink tons of phrases in the obituaries and do research on the person who died yeah and I call that hypertext and jamming where you you know you take

a phrase like frat perhaps serve as as education secretary for President Clinton okay let me take you know the phrase President Clinton and Link it to and you know some sideways experience or you know President Nixon and send it to you know a page about his scandalous or so okay whose line so you have sort of editorial content in the links so the vh1 bubbles before there were bubbles

yes extras after to be hm well but it was exactly it's exactly the same thing so I think and we still the hyperlink is is one of the most underused tools on the web especially the title tag so I would do things that are so there's the work the phrase itself that means something then there's the hover the title tag right that can give you a different meaning or condemn she was

layered right a layered experience on top of it and then the actual href where you go and a lot of times I would link to Google searches so you link to a Google search that is tangential or off the Exide and then they can have a ton of context that is constantly constantly out of it yeah and that cool yeah so yeah that was the idea of Google bitching I had been on salon

at that time so that's when I started getting into creating my own content so you were starting to take in and you were looking at ways already that enough finding new fresh content and pulling it in without having to just generate your own kind that you can just link to that search and it was almost like a form of data mining yeah is you already saying okay I'm going to pass a spur and you're

going to get these results and it's just data and it changes and you know the context changes and so even two years later it's still based on the user being logged in or not yeah it's it's it's poetry it's kind of a it's a live form of poetry went that's why I looked at so you went from there and how did you get introduced to polling data I mean how did you go to the next step so I work

for this company called done solutions group and they they purchased the design firm I work for it word for it on the early designed from web design firms in Chicago called streams that was started by Dave's korzak and so I was a project manager person there and we did pretty well and they've sold the company to done solutions group okay and it was more of a technical place they were more

into you know more than they want to do like web design and more likely heavy-duty systems okay we're into like you know business intelligence oh they weren't like a consultant they were there's about a hundred person firm that did a lot of business intelligence okay you know they were doing some some companies storefront website right timekeeping system stuff like that so

we're sort of at Division did web design and then everything with the help because it was you know 2001 and people and everything yeah it just you know the the web technology world kinda went crazy right and go in collapse and you know the bobble at least it although there was plenty of at work and so I got more involved in more technical projects so I became more astute and more

about you know heavier-duty content management systems things along those lines and I was continually frustrated by them because I mean at that time it was like the age of vignette vignette was a CMS content management okay that cost like a million dollars to use that has young been yet sounds like a good idea I think it's probably was but never a couple other players in this space and

it was ludicrous but it would cost that much money and it didn't have that many features and when I first like radio userland that was what the salon blogs were based on radio user land was the first blog platform that i canta canta all right it was incredibly powerful in and had RSS built in very early RSS and the idea of being able to ping and make constant updates incredibly appealing

and just the ability to democratize and push down the ability to publish was a really kill me and obviously was killing everybody yeah the history of the web right yes loves the blogs took off so this is your slipper this is my own personal realization and so I had at that time so it's maybe 2004-2005 pretty good pretty good technical project manager to the point where developers

couldn't snow me anymore and I can actually be more effective at my job and and then learn about these powerful very low-cost tools and so I started doing websites on the side by myself for you know churches schools community groups things like that started doing community technology training like I took typepad I like doing crazy things that you're not

supposed to do with tools right so tight bags incredibly powerful because you for one account for with $15 you can set up an infinite number of blocks right so I had you know juggernaut code typepad com and they had domain mapping to so you could you couldn't have them at whatever URL you wanted so I made a website for my church queen of angels parish in Chicago and north side and then we could

have sub blogs for different ministries rank so it's like you're into the feeding homeless or you want to you know the peace and justice and then they can have their own sets you could have this whole hierarchy of content under one type ad account it's 15 bucks 15 by mind blown yeah it's 2005 right so you could just have an infinite amount of content in a really simple SAS you know content

management system that anybody could use so started doing that and then you know we have a lot of spanish-speaking people in the parish and they were like wow this is awesome of course they would say it in Spanish and but I don't you know know how to do this because I did all this training in English or so I did bilingual computer training and and it's just the Bihar yourself Spanish so you

could know I just know some spanish about go good with I'm pretty you know I can I can go pick it up I used to work in construction with a lot of skin drywaller so I wanted to hide they got in high school and then college and then right after college and I was able to talk normal so I have a I could get along and we had other Spanish a bilingual spanish english speakers it

had been training and did a lot of other you know community-based stuff like in rogers park did computer training for death court north which was the community development organization up there and and then add to that around 2005 i was doing stuff for the mayor's office here in Chicago okay and start that was when I first really got into civic data and the idea was that we were

going to take basically Chicago Crime Dog which was created by Adrian hollowbody girl she on yeah general yeah who would be benevolent dictator for life for Jack and I that's an amazing title yeah so Adrian came up with Chicago Crime Kaduri which was just a singular mind-blowing thing because he reverse engineered the google maps yeah before there was even an API in the idea

would be able to show where crimes were happening he was able to put da was a real time or so it was always nine days til nine days so nowadays real time real time in terms of when the data was published where I put it down okay so you knew data get published and I'd be out there yeah so um you know I just like anybody else on the internet who saw when he first published I was like

whoa whoa that's you know pretty amazing yeah and then I had some work with the city of Chicago at that time and they were like you know we would like to send a hit we do all these 3 11 service requests and we get a lot of stuff done and then we have a list of email addresses for community people and i want to send an email with a PDF attachment of all the 311 service

request it was complete and I was like wow let me show you the site this one dude did yeah and I said what if this wasn't crime if it was three Malone service request was building permits restaurants pensions and all the other great things that the city does for people what if you never sent an email or never made it it was available to everybody and you never

sent a PDF so they bought into it and then we did a project called Chicago works for you calm Chicago works for you yep Chicago works for you calm and to make a long story short it was kiboshed okay and never saw light of day oh really yeah but through that I met Adrienne and then when Adrian got the grant to start everyblock com which is local news and community

website I joined him and a couple others scoff on he was a founder and some other co-founders a nice got into open data in the Civic data world that way ok so now fast forward from there you've created that you've helped to create these these tools and then have been involved in the formation of these concepts open government Chicago and some of the community groups are you starting to

spread out and get other people involved and how they can contribute to this yep how did that come about so in my role and every block I was responsible for getting civic data from 16 cities so cold calling Mayor Michael Bloomberg and if you're right you know hey can I talk to the mayor you'll be stunned to hear and he was in a meeting yeah I'm like oh yeah he's um wasn't me but sigh ended up

just talking to people about you know our project which we wanted you know like every building permit every restaurant inspection every every crime report and they'd end up sending me to whatever goofball in the mayor's office or department was interested in stuff like that okay and the people that usually transferred me to now are actually some of the leaders of the open

government for me oh really in each of the cities yeah kind of funny outward a lot of the out of the shadows they were you know just like any good idea there's always someone else who's thinking about it too yeah so you know these are people who are fighting the good fight about open data and open using new tools to make up meant more efficient and effective and speaking of

using the tools you have a new project or getting your percolating or you're looking to launch yep so we did launch it so the Civic user testing room Civic user testing group so the cut group the Civic user testing group is a set of regular chicago residents who get paid to test out civic apps okay so Civic app sort of thing the QA and the provided feedback on the app's there's a and all

this crash or doesn't work here it ends up being a QA function but the idea is that you know we've been pretty successful the public getting the city to publish a lot of data and working directly with them and working directly with the mayor as a candidate and as the mayor informing policy it allows for the publication of data and city the city of Chicago is a great leader in this

respect and Brett goldstein the chief data officer for the city and John tova the chief technology officer for the city in the mayor's office have been just great leaders in this respect so and then you know opening of Chicago you mentioned that Jovah mooska started that group okay in 2009 and I helped them to start it and we you know try to focus on developers

and people who are interested in data I'm trying to get them interested in from civic David I know you did an interview with with Paul Baker Baker whoo-hoo you know he hosted a lot of those meetings over right by the texts so there's just a lot of people who are already interested in this self and Joe just had the idea to you know try to organize those people so that's been

pretty successful and we have you know open gov hack nights that were started by Derek Gator and one pop Pablo the lettuce and I mean there's been a few projects that have come out of those as well I'm so via the Chicago or was the lobby data I came from the exam even cite that because young love is done Chicago lobbyists several okay so then that was able to show where lobbying

money was going correct so they were able to say this group donated this amount of money for this cause yep and and Paul kind of describe that there was something interesting that it wasn't the data that wasn't what I expected some people thought i was going to be the cigarette groups trying to get you know the smoking ban left in and actually turned out to be trying to build

hospitals yeah then it was it was interesting to find out that the government wasn't just spending money on evil rice it was actually trying to do something good right and that was his ribbon any surprises for you over the years i'm looking at data and being like wow that's really changed my perspective on how things are for the battle for the worse well i think in general you know

there's a lot of uninformed thought around the delivery of services in the city that you know maybe some areas get more service is another and I've worked in 16 cities now I've never seen that really and in fact services are delivered in a really equal way across cities and across inside cities that's what I've learned and I just have a lot of respect

for municipal government all over because there's so many city employees that just do really great work and there's nothing no none of us sitting on the side and the Civil actor industry if you want to call it that I do want to call it that the civic acting civic hacking sector civic innovation sector of the technology industry we wouldn't be doing anything it weren't for the

hard work of the GIS professionals that actually drew every every polygon cities right if you know they didn't publish the street sections for every every road and you know we wouldn't be doing anything and what if it was you know they really unsung heroes of this movement because I think we tend to give attention to the shiny new thing and the app that came out oh yeah you know the

thing that comes out in our face right away now not all of the inputs are feeling behind it to make it possible even something like plow tracker the city publishes that shows the plows in real time that's really slick it's fun to watch it but it's important to remember yeah it's important to remember that there's human beings right we're paid to get into trucks and drive them

safely across the city so that dot that's move around as a person it's a human being who's busting his ass for us so so there's that concept and then I think that what we're trying to do with the Civic user testing group is to inject and build a culture of testing and culture of collaboration and coke asian with so even if it is not writing this stuff you're part of the

possibility of this working and sharing this information even if you're just a person out there with it in your hand using it you're the most important person in the world obviously yeah in any technology company oh yeah this is you know nobody's using it and it's just it's it's so the motto that we have and then the cut group is if it doesn't work for me it doesn't work so that's the

general concept is that that we need everybody we need the government to publish data we need government workers to to do their work we need developers to care and we need them to develop high quality song word and I think we've really got that in Chicago more leader in this space and everybody deserves a ton of credit what we need now is true engagement with real residents who

helped us do our work and help us decide what to make and what will be of use to them to improve their lives and to provide meaningful opportunity to expand the economy here in Chicago and bring you know reduce poverty and bring it full circle but you know they consume it they give feedback and then you're able to make better decisions and give them new stuff and then your feedback goes

back to the people who are using your whose services you're using a threat and even more than again there's a spirit of co-creation they say you know what you made something it works really nice it's completely irrelevant to my life be better if you make this right so you know just going all the way back to them to the creation process and also you do consulting for the government as well

the Chicago City so so that information you know how shoe get better information helps the city make better plans so that way they can deliver so that's that's actually the real full cycle Yeah right then and that's the role that we can play here in Chicago climate is because we're founded by the city of Chicago the Chicago Community Trust and macarthur foundation so I work here at the trust

and MacArthur provides significant funding we'll get funding from on project basis from all sorts of funders here in Chicago and people who we need to get things done so we do some specific projects for the mayor's office whether it's hosting the adopt a sidewalk program or coming up with Chicago early learning gorg that shows where you can

find early childhood pre-k locations and programs and you know we have a texting function on that for creating open source code that allows us and allows everybody to build on right there's the I forgot about this into you just mentioned there is the open source group here in Chicago what are they the name of the people doing the open source of tools it's like sunshine or something

like that that's news to me okay there but ok I'm I might be saying totally the wrong thing right now but I know there's a group that's working on tools to help make sharing data more feasible Paul would know more about that yeah so so sorry for the tangent here hahaha but anyway thank you very much for taking the car i sat out there really crazy you

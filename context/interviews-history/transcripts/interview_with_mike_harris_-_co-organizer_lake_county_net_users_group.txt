it was a co-organizer with the LC no user group in well where is the LT nug the lake county done that user Bruce Lee County Mike so lake county is in the upper northwest part of illinois we meet at the count of lake county for our meetings in the t building second thursday of the month okay so like how far out of chicago is that um probably about an hour depends on traffic i mean

you could probably get 30 minutes without traffic okay so you're in one of the suburban groups-- it's kind of kind of far out there yes yeah yeah it's uh it's kind of uh by great america okay so you know suburban community you know just wondering you know how did you get involved with lake how many done that user group in in what brought you to the dinette community so I live in mundelein

um five years ago I took a job using net and I was looking for a user group you know kind of level up my skill set and figure out what people were doing the community discovered there was one pretty close to me and went to my first meeting which was prob about three years ago and went for a year straight and then I got offered the opportunity co-lead and took it up cool so I you

know what was that like you know you wanted was that your first user group did she had ever attended um it was my first user group outside of like a private organization so prior to that I was at allstate for five years is java developer and they had a Java user group and i went to those meetings and then eventually became a leader of that a group there and then when I had left arm

Allstate a and took on the.net role then I was looking for dotnet community cool so so year you've been involved in two different communities here I you know you know coming from the java community into the dotnet community what what did you see has maybe some differences between those communities and in and what would your experience going from the Java into India the Oracle sun java

world to the microsoft corp yeah yeah so I left I left the job world per se as java developer right around the time when they got acquired for my oracle so like when i was it with it it was still son and I so I would say part of the big difference that i noticed becoming like the microsoft community maybe like java or like maybe a software craftsmanship community is

that like though I micra Microsoft community seems like four years it was pretty much driven by or sorry the dead net community seems like four years it was driven by what Microsoft came out with and stuff like that we're like the java community son was a big pusher but there was still a lot of open source type thing that came in and to me that's kind of like a big difference between

like dotnet and maybe other communities i see is like opens always a little bit newer it seems so there's still a lot of what microsoft says is like the focus of the community right open you know good and bad yeah so since you came in and have been co-organized even pushing on more alternative tools like new topics that are not necessarily Microsoft ya trick ya so I since I I joined I we had

a couple talks a we had a Colin Jones come in and do some closure Coty's or comb with us um bringing in more different perspectives and things of that nature but for the most part it's I tried to stay true to what the roots are and have to have topics that are more like things you would expect to see i dot net community think that our current coming out microsoft word luff of that

nature but a couple times per year we i try to make sure that we get some outside perspectives and yeah and collins a great guy he's I don't know that the closure Cowen's our what was it seems to macado's with you or the colons the the cones yeah okay yeah we ever I've mentioned it kind of like kadas because that's kind of the way we treated it but it was the actual

cones no yeah so so what for those people who haven't heard of the closure coins what were they and you know what was that meeting like where you guys did them yes sir so the the cone is um I believe ruby was where they came from and the idea is that it's kind of like a simple problem to try to teach you the language as you progress through so the first cone I believe in both closer and

closer script is what is true and all you gotta do is type in true or any truth each value in Croatia and then it passes it so it's kind of like a test driven fill in the blank way of teaching yourself a language yeah and it gets progressively harder and more nuanced does she go along yep yep you go you go all the way from what's truth to macros which is probably when the more advanced

topics fertile yeah yeah that's definitely a little further down the road um so you know did you did you have everybody just bring their own laptops for that sore yeah so we have everyone come in and bring their own laptops we've done a couple other similar things where we have people bring in laptops we've done a couple I'll call it a cada at dojo and the idea with that is you do

a simple problem like fizzbuzz coin changer something that nature and then the way I I ran it was present the problem so what is the physical problem you know what we're trying to do here and then have people go and pair off if they want to do some pair programming or just go ahead on their own and then gay people i think was about 15 or 20 minutes and then so you know okay this

time and then we discussed our solutions for things we might have you know thought was kind of interesting shorter solutions and then I brought it in another one I think we did a coin changer after that and then same thing about 20 minutes and then we discussed that afterwards yeah so is that like a typical meeting structure for LC nog or do you do more also do like sin up and

talk type sessions um definitely the more common one is to stand up and talk one that seems to be more popular with the group that comes but we do try to do some interactive type things we've done a lean coffee before which is idea i picked up at my work and the idea would you do live a lean coffee talk the name comes from doing the first thing in the morning but we meet like at seven so i

think i called a lean pop or something like that yeah and the idea is everyone takes a couple of minutes and they write down things they would like to talk about some stickies yeah well I'm a calm bomb board a very simple one that just has topics what we're talking about and then a dun cow so it's very simple and then what happens is we someone will go through read through all the topics then

everyone comes up in votes they get two votes put a little hash mark or tick mark on it and then whatever gets the most votes we talked about that and then the format for the talking we do this thing called 841 so we'll talk about a topic for eight minutes and eight minutes an alarm will go off and then people get a vote a simple yes no or in between so yes no in between and then if

the majority of the yeses or if you get a majority vote for yes then you go on for an hour four minutes another vote takes place if you get a majority yes as you go on for one minute so the idea is that you don't have like a topic that only one or two people really care to talk about right Tom you need a whole meeting so you can get through more things and then you know if someone

doesn't like it if they could vote it down and at worse maybe they might only have to spend five more minutes hearing about it cool so is that I mean do people like have the talks prepared before and or like impromptu impromptu oh yeah just impromptu topics so it's not really a for that kind of thing it's not really a talk per se it's more just a

conversation of everyone who's at the meeting so anyone's so kind of forces like here's a subject in let's talk about that instead of people gone ah I don't know what do we talk about waffle exactly and then and then you know people vote so whatever was the most popular topic that's the one we're going to talk about so in theory that should be something that people want to talk

about cool and I mean where did you get that idea from the time that was actually pretty kind of a new variation on the Thea uncomf unconference style yeah so we we've been doing that a bit of my work for a couple years now and I found this it's pretty good we used to do it every Wednesday and then it got kind of scaled back from there and we do it about every other week now lisa has a

developer to get together on the second one day or every other monday we get to go during lunch and we run a median like that hell yeah I never heard of that style yeah cool so so it sounds like you know with your work at the with LC know you've you've been bringing in some new blood and some new ideas like you said there was kind of a traditional style user before you joined you know what

you're doing some different stuff I mean are you are the sole organizer for the the groove or is it a team how does how does managing the meetings work okay yeah so I'm a code lead so my other co-lead is among and it the way it's been well going is whoever has the topic or is working with the speaker's usually the one who kind of organizes the actual logistics of the meeting um and in

general he's been doing a little bit more with key sponsors and things of that nature and I've been doing a little bit more with the speakers but he's definitely brought in his fair share right I'm sure I menace is is known for his robotics and as a mobile was if I recall yes I'm sure he's no shortage of topics himself nope yeah yeah I've had him I have him and his brother come in

it at least once to save me from a speaker that couldn't make it last format type thing cool well you know just looking at uh you know just want to talk before we wrap up here is about having a group out in the suburbs versus in the city heavy have you worked with like where was the Java Derby's was that in the city or was that also on the suburbs so the Java group was at all

state which would be in northbrook so that would be in suburbs okay and my work so my works in Milwaukee and oddly enough the Milwaukee dot net user group also works there and so I've been a couple of his meetings from what I could tell in general it's a little bit harder to get people to come out to the like suburbs he runs his amake on a typical meeting I mean he usually the minimums

at least 40 people wear me like the minimum might be more around like 15 type thing that's not pretty good sharing out in the suburbs that is pretty good yeah definitely not going to complain about it yes especially kind of far out there in like for those of you don't know where how Illinois is situated grayslake is kind of its kind of in in the in the sticks you might say

it's a I mean it's not like what you got 290 coming up or 294 what is that they made major highway but it's it's a little bit kind of geographically not easy to get you from the city in my experience true yeah yeah you would have to get off the highway a little bit to get the OCLC I think people who come our local formatting yeah I don't think there's a whole lot of people from say

but you know every now and then we need some people and actually you know I you have one more question there's a few conferences they're kind of Microsoft centric there's a chicago code camp and then there is the of that conference well and i know that they were some of the that the people who were involved with the lake county done that user group in the past were involved with

chicago code camp and the fat conference are you are you at all working with them or collaborating with them as well yes so so this year I did some of the media relationship for of the chicago code camp meaning of course is involved in both i guess from the standpoint of that conference with my group means obviously involved with that one I'm not actually involved with it but we are the user

group I believed us answer that conference in some way by sir okay well you know thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me I really appreciate it Mike well thank you very much pleasure

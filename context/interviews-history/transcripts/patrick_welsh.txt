hi it's Mike again with you tastic i'm here at SCA i'm sitting down with patrick walsh patrick is a a gelato and test eric kind of set up like a holistic angeles but he's yesterday we had a kind of an interesting conversation and he brought up the topic of a network weaver well first thanks for sitting down with me but what is what is a network weaver what is that bored me so the term as

introduced to me means something that people kind of either are or not you know so natural programmers are people who can't prevent themselves from programming or they'll start to go a little stir crazy yeah and I am a natural network weaver and I'll just described the algorithm which is actually kind of simple it's a simple algorithm that that Weaver's can't

prevent themselves from following it goes like this they join communities and they join community is relatively easy they easily they find it easy to meet people and to become part of communities in some way and they're comfortable joining lots of communities and they keep track of what different people in different communities love and are good at and work hard on and they tend to

remember when there are opportunities for people in different communities to connect and they make those connections and so what ends up happening is that they cause a cross-pollination to occur so both communities that have members cross back and forth end up being helped by fresh blood and fresh ideas yeah so you don't have the island of facts in and then you have yes enough everybody

looks a little bit too much alike and before I even see from but um thoughts on but by bringing a new genetic material the new idea so yeah they distributed and then everybody can be healthy and have a good immune system right yeah but so so that relates to you know technical you talking wait to me that if we share ideas and go to different user groups and reach out

for like hey I'm obvious and I want to JavaScript group or I wanted to even go even further up and go to me Don that meeting something I'm not you're doing those are classic examples by the way and I have helped we've connections between communities in each of those areas that were mostly insular right and you know it turns out that a lot of rubyists don't know that there's this

beautiful dynamically typed functional programming language hiding deep within the dysfunction of JavaScript right and if you frame it just correctly to them and hook them up with the right person then it becomes easier and more fun for them to learn JavaScript and JavaScript programmers can learn that there's this Ruby community in which there is much less of the danger and and noise much

better signal-to-noise ratio in this other language both people and both of those different communities end up being grateful for the comparison and for the connection and for learning those different things at least that's how that's how it works well when people are sufficiently passionate right and also it kind of makes you wonder about with the kind of movement to seeing more

software craftsmanship or native groups and we're here at SCA which is getting more and more popular every year and we're seeing more self across worship themed user groups where they're not tied to a specific platform specific language just that we have this kind of scene where ideals should we'd like to be more like this way but we have different ways of approaching that

problem oh yeah so they're more open to having that I think network weaving where you have the PHP guy come in and this C guy and you got a java I should say that and probably the Ruby gal just yeah oh absolutely yeah but but some you know you have a mixture of different ideas and engenders and then racial backgrounds coming together and instead

of thinking about well how can I identify with people that have this one specific trait they share with me how can i mix with a lot of different people and and get new ideas and fresh ideas and maybe new perspective I mean is that kind of like unnatural organic way that this concept of the network weaving is becoming more of a concept in technical communities or no I say it's always been

there and it's it was a kind of minority prejudice if you will I cannot prevent myself from joining different communities i'm addicted to joining communities learning about communities learning how people learn their definitions of successful failure whether courageous about the things that they consider important and you know when you mention a craftsmanship

movement that's in software right now I see all these threads that cut across communities that have to do with things like accountability and professionalism and mentoring and fresh blood and those things are easy for me to talk easier for me to talk about with some Authority and experience the more communities I have participated in but I can't it for me it's kind of an obsession it's an

addiction I know a lot of people who really want to concentrate deeply in a single place in a relatively narrow community where there's usually plenty to learn no right and they want to stay there and they want to learn deeply and I tend to move more broadly and I you know sometimes sit for a while and mole and concentrate but I mostly move around because that seems to be the way I add

the most value it's just the natural for me sure go with that that basic thin of acid on that developer guy in a previous life i like to say but I was looking at going into Ruby and basically they combined it was kind of all or nothing movies move over it to review and just totally focus on becoming a foster form developer or stick with Donna which I had already invested a lot

and right and then the decision that kind of crystallized was deep or what yeah and some people like what you're describing is the social networker likes to go wide nice to get a broad spectrum of experience and maybe just go just deep enough but deep enough to understand deep enough to understand what people what people care about those yeah but if you're sometimes another

type of for something and this or a word for that type of personality that is would be so that the social networker tends to span across is our concept for the person's like I want to stay in this one vertical and just dig deep into that so I mean there are different personality classification systems and some of this I suppose is more introvert and extrovert yeah some of it is people

whose thinking tends to be in shorter bursts like mine that my thinking is constantly interrupted by fresh ideas and I work very hard to become more grounded and to concentrate more and to listen better but my natural way of thinking and communicating and learning is with lots and lots of good cuts and lots and lots of outputs so chatty thinking yes exactly which can be you

know inconvenient for me and inconvenient for people i work with but it has this cross-pollinating kind of broadcasting value to it I keep track of a lot of people so I like to say I'm not a great programmer but I have one of the best collections of friends who are great programmers ever and you have binders full of pearl oh that's a lot ahead

on my iPhone but I but if I'm watching Joe yes exactly so I i love i love it when an awesome programmer with an interesting idea doesn't know about another awesome programmer in whatever a text at our language our country or you know whatever doesn't know about another programmer in another community with us with a related idea and I can connect them to each other and it's not at all

confined to programmers I made a members lots of other kinds of community it's a human thing and that's really what exact important thing to remember in these technical communities is we've picked a topic but we're all people yeah and that's one of things i like about with the soft craftsmanship as we're encouraged to look outside of our community and look at what other people

sure and how how the Carpenters perhaps when how the dentist is a craftsman sure that the Durst that even my barber which I have to see more often is it is a craftsman itself audio because he has a skeleton practices it and teaches other people and sure they but even kind of a mentoring and he's a little bit of an old-timey barber yeah and I'm old-timey barber but but that we have so much to

learn from each other as people and that we shouldn't just focus on our one little niche well i don't know i think we don't have to rely on individuals to master every variety of learning and interaction and it's ok if we rely on balanced enough communities to take care of that not everyone should have to be a network weaver right and I'm Freddie sorry as you just need somebody to

knuckle down and get a job absolutely so you know a balanced software development team frequently has people like me who served in roles of intermediating between developers and testers I do a lot of that and intermediating between developers and testers and product owners and operations people I care about every one of those different silos and rolls and and their definitions

mastery I'm addicted to the notion of mastery generally for the guy this morning who got me the bacon yeah you know that guy was obviously a master chef yeah and he admitted it to me yeah and I enjoyed meeting him just for a minute or two and took his picture holding his beautiful tray of perfectly cooked bacon yeah because I was as pleased to meet a master chef not know

where as I would beat him to meet a master Ruby test driver yeah and just make sense just so the evil run watching your context is where the stn a conference and there's the buffet of all the bread all the bread that they have their eyes he'll help me with it yeah all the healthy food right um and one of the people who's preparing the chef collegiate atmosphere you wouldn't know

that just you know jazz out it and asks if everything is okay and and Patrick just says I really love some bacon and the chef says I'm sending their for it and he just lets come with me and then they both run off and next you know there's a tweet that got some bacon for my new friend and yeah sounds wise and that's a perfect memory the moment that's the thing I cannot help do it is

introducing myself to new people regardless so you know cab drivers right chefs software craftsmen barters I'd really I got my hair cut very recently and the guys who cut my hair are these crazy 1950s slicked back you know they have their own culture they all race hot rods yeah play electric guitar you know if I find an opportunity to talk to anybody who is obviously passionate

about anything they do i will i'll take advantage of it yeah well thank you very much for taking the time to sit down thank you fine

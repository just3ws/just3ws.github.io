hi it's Mike again with you tastic today I'm sitting down with Chris Whitaker who's involved with the smart Chicago collaborative and now correct me if I'm wrong it was the code for america is that correct so correct I have a dual role I'm the local organizer here in Chicago for Code for America and I'm also a consultant with the smart Chicago collaborative which is a non-profit

group here in Chicago yeah and both of those are one or both of those are involved with a lot of hackfest sin and contributing open code for people to get at data that's government data and government information I can you tell a little bit about the heck fasten and how Code for America and the Chicago smart collaborative are involved in those and how do you how do you work in those sure

well the opening of hack nights are actually being run by Derek eater and Juan Bellas with open City they've been doing these hack nights at place called 1871 which is a co-working space in Chicago's merchandise mart for about the past year without them every Tuesday night at 6pm same place same time and that's where a lot of sort of volunteer coders go to work on projects that they

want to spend more time on than just like a weekend event my role with smart Chicago collaborative we are investing in several different apps that we pay people full time money to help develop one of these apps is all food born Chicago that searches Twitter's for I'm sorry searches Twitter for tweets about food poisoning oh really and once it finds that out it'll tweet back at the

author saying hey I'm sorry you're sick can you give us some more information and with that information we can actually submit a 311 request to the city to send a food inspector to that restaurant so these are these are apps that are actually really interacting with people these aren't just like oh I put those things kind of up on the web but it

it's these are real apps that do that are performing a public service and so I unfortunate to be in Chicago's civic technology scene where we're building both big things like food born and then small things like an app that will tell you when your local police beat meeting is or how to find you're nearing polling how to find your nearest polling place so we're kind of working on both a big

level and a smaller level I think it's really interesting to see I mean I've spoken with Dan X O'Neal and and and Paul Baker about the open government and it's really fascinating to see what's happening here in Chicago around civic hacking and and and the hackfest that you were just recently doing can you tell me a little bit about what those were having they were weekend events

though that were well we've this summer we've had a lot of hackathons in Chicago I think the earliest one do we've had this year was the weeds the Chicago Police Department recently launched an API to help communicate community concerns to Chicago Police Department through a program called caps and so we had a hackathon at Google to sort of play with that API and see what we could

do with it we recently just finished the National Day of civic hacking which we had three simultaneous events in Chicago we had a hackathon that was focused on immigration in Chicago's pilsen neighborhood we had a youth center hackathon at adler planetarium and then we had more of a general hackathon at 1871 ok and so how did how did you get involved with these is this something

you have you been running groups before um I started out in the public sector as a field representative for the Illinois Department of Employment Security I got hired on just as the recession was beginning and the bottom was dropping out and there were just lines and lines of people out the door and so I you know I show up on my first day of work i'm excited i am ready to

you know how my community during this kind of rough time again on my computer and it's a dose program I am NOT is a la space program that is probably older than I am and I you know because I had recently gotten out of college and had been you know used to having computer labs with the latest and greatest I had a smartphone and I'm looking at this I'm going you this is unreal yeah so I ran

towards the civic technologists as fast as I could go and I had gotten an invite to organ group called urban geek drinks that Justin Massa had started to sort of pull together people who were involved in an urban policy and technology and kind of put them all in one room and through that I met Derek either with open the city and paul baker and dan o'neill and just sort of that's sort of

how I got involved when Code for America launched its brigade program I wanted to get involved because I think Code for America is doing just phenomenal work in this area and wanted to be able to contribute in a way that was more than just trying to start under the meetup group Chicago already had an open gov middle group and so I proposed a plan to brigade on how to sort of expand the

universe in terms of civic technology issues and do that I got more involved in smart Chicago and just kind of went from there and you use the term Bob Brigade captain I was that was kind of interesting what it what is a brigade captain and how does that work for the code for america so coat the brigade program started last October in about 13 1 l and 34 different cities plus is

national this is a national program so in most cities um these are the individuals who are organizing very first hackathons these cities have had who are doing the hard sort of task of gathering all the people together in a room and having them focus on using using technology to solve several problems in Chicago were fortunate that we've already been through that wall

that we already have a very active open government group Jojo Muntz gun and dan o'neill started opening up Chicago probably about five years ago and so when the brigade program started we wanted to make sure that you know we weren't just duplicating efforts right and so we're in most cities they're trying to start groups in Chicago where more of a support role okay and we also

use what we've learned here in Chicago and sort of export those lessons and those code bases that we've developed to other younger cities okay so I mean if I was in the city that was looking at wanted you to get involved with Code for America you know I live in some not not the biggest metropolitan area but or I'm even maybe out in the suburbs and I want to do something is that something that

would be for example myself i live in crystal lake but there be it's that something i would do for my city or is really absolutely um what you can go to brigade code for america gorg okay and there'll be sort of a sign-up sheet where you can say hey i am a code or i have these skills i'm a community organizer i have these skills I have these challenges that I'm dealing with

and that will let national headquarters know who you are if there's something already in your area they will introduce you to the local organizer there if there's nobody there then they'll connect you with resources on how you can start your own Brigade in your city and how you can sort of gain access to all the resources and the network that code for America has to offer yeah and

this is something you might think would be good for existing user groups like if you already have and already have a presence there could be does this is it something that really has to be kind of a standalone thing or can I none at all Chicago doesn't have like its own separate code for america meetup group we've just sort of co-opted the meetup

groups and the weekly hack nights that already existed to borrow an army term you sort of stay in your lane yeah or don't fix what's what's not broken right and so for groups that are already active in their communities and already doing hackathons and things with Civic technology you don't have to start your whole separate thing to be involved in code for america I know New York did

something similar in that they co-opted some of the groups and I know there's groups in DC they were already working on stuff before they got involved a brigade so by all means you can sort of co-opted and connect with code for America's network even if you already have a group that kind of does the same thing yes so it could be a great way to arguments in existing community give

them some more purpose than just stop pizza and the latest libraries oh and up one of the things I had been thinking about was recently there's been a lot of talk about gianna say and Snowden and all this worries about faisan it seems like there's a potential for cracking down on what seems to been like a lot of good work that groups like Code for America have already started is that

something that's been discussed or or is it something that's come up words just too new I think I think the biggest sort of shots of criticism and concern and the people who are really adamant about the government sort of behaving itself when it comes to these things are the same group of people who are involved in civic technology and how we can use the power of technology for good and how we

can use open government data for good so I think obviously there's been and talk in my circles because these circles are the people who are yelling about the NSA thing but I don't think its limits or as a barrier to the kind of work that we're doing in which we're using information that the government produces as a ride product its fuel and so I think it's a different problem set

than what we do in the hack nights and in sort of the civic hacking technology community so what you're dealing with it's mostly stuff that's been already released its openly and intentionally available for for people to tap into and utilize so people don't have to worry about I haven't run to Bolivia am I being my viewpoint on it is what can be released without violating privacy

should be released and I know the city of Chicago has been particularly careful about making sure that when it does release geocoded information it doesn't give any way any personally identifying information most recent example the city recently released energy uses statistics by census tract the exception with that is there's a couple of tracks that they've actually merged because there

was in some places there was just one building and they didn't want that one building to be able to identify their energy uses they wanted to be able to mix it up some stew off to sort of off you skate a little bit with the crime statistics they do the same thing they give a range of addresses on the city's released ten years of crime data and gotten it down to the block level which

gives you really good information but at the same time they keep that range in there so you can't identify the person behind the crime report to protect victims and so I think the city's done a good job of making sure that while they're opening up data they're not opening up anything personal the exception being lobbyists data which if your lie being the city your name is

going to be out there right so some of those things that have to do political transparency people have likely of names well Nelson is where we help the migra hack and and so one of the things that we were kind of proud of and if we have time I'd like to throw that in pilsen recently had a startup incubator called see Bella that's designed to sort of spur startups within

the Hispanic community and I think it was important to not only have that in neighborhoods that are not downtown I think it was also important for us to have one of our hackathons in the neighborhoods 1871 is fantastic I can't say enough good things about it but it's in a fortress merchandise mart a huge a building and well that's nice being sort of infini 5-mile radius of all the tech

startups it's also important to be out in the neighborhood so we connect with everyday residence so that we make apps that soft Civic problems were interacting with every every day residence in order to make sure that our stuff works for them ok and we'll go ahead and include this in the interview because it I want to ask it's kind of interesting what you just said is

bringing bringing the developers into a community and probably trying to pull developers out from that community did you ever have people who are just regular old citizens or not tuck devspeak types come on check out what's going on and almost every week we have the ratios about 60 40 depending on kind of what's going on one of the things that one of the apps that I'm sort of

most proud of is the school cuts org app Chicago recently closed a great many number of schools and during that process it was hard for parents to get good information and so essentially a google developers partnered up with a parent organization to sort of learn what questions and parents have what concerns do they have and they created this whole site

that put the information in one spot and explained everything that was going on what why CPS was born and close the school where that child is going next and sort of built the entire app around the concerns of the parent groups and I think it's one of the best apps that's come out this year the other thing that we've done is smart Chicago collaborative has started a user testing

group we have about 400 testers in all 50 Awards in the city so that when we go to once we build an app we can test it with r everyday residents to make sure that it actually makes sense to someone who doesn't know how to program or has never been to a hackathon that way we sort of have a reality check when we start to create this stuff and that's the civic user testing correct yes yeah

and I has any I talked with Dan ex O'Neill back when he was first launched into that has there been any interesting projects that have come out of that so we just went through our first program test with Tom Campari's go to school app the app is mobile friendly it works on phones it works on computers it essentially you put in your child's school you say what time you need to get

to school and it will give you transit directions walking directions or driving directions to that school it's designed to make it easy for parents to sue for that first few weeks of school when I try still trying to find your routine we did a test in Englewood and then we did a test in uptown to test those apps to make sure they made sense we did that early July that way tom has enough time

to revamp the app and re-release it when it when they start the school year okay so I mean these these are things that are actively being adopted yes oh wow that's that's that's for the courts it's it's pretty neat to have a conversation with somebody when they're just launching something and then hear about how it's actually in people's hands potentially changing school attendance

levels so that's going to reap rewards down the line yes we're very excited because it was one of those apps that sort of made sense because we already knew there would be a bunch of people who would use it to sort of and it's a it's a fairly simple problem but at the same time he's building in a way that caters to parents I mean he's at Chicago publish preparing himself it remembers

your school so you know your child gets sick one morning and you're instead of searching frantically for what the sick call number is you pull up the app it remembers who where your child goes in school and it listens to call number just right there at the bottom so that you can just call the school and it's and it's done yeah yeah so so by making information more accessible it might

produce the what do they say that generally if I drumble remembered reading a statistic that said if a child was even suspended once that their likelihood of dropping out of high school one up you know multiple times so it wasn't a simple thing so even something as simple as making sure that attendance is good and it could probably have long-term effects on other life

that has to be pretty satisfying knowing that that's out there and actually being honest yeah I know what you interesting once school get started and to watch the use of statistics I don't know how it'll actually affects school attendance I don't know it how much of that impact will have I know another app that Tom's made sort of along the same lines is the safe haven app so that when kids are

walking to school or hanging out during the summer they can easily identify safe places to go during the summer if they need to get out of trouble so we're kind of watching the use of statistics on that carefully to see you know is this being used in business having an impact so is that like to avoid gang or drug activity it's it's a community safety application interesting wow so there's

that is the official repo to go look at some of these projects is it is at the gov in trenches you know the UM the two apps that Tom kapaa raised app is on his personal github account if you go to smart Chicago apps work it lists all the apps that we've developed as smart Chicago and all the apps that we're hosting we provide free hosting for civic app developers and i believe on

that site it will also link you to the github repositories I'm depending on who built it it'll go to their own repository yeah now sorry i miss my misread that the gov entrenches is your personal repo okay so yeah I'll definitely linked to the smart app smart Chicago apps and yeah it has lots of perhaps that looks like they could be very useful for a lot of people the

other good website to look for is open City apps org open City apps is Derek and Derek eaters his group's github repository kind of page an application gallery and on on that site they're all all the github repositories for their sites are listed as well okay great i will definitely linked to these in the show notes well thank you again for taking the time to sit down with me

chris i really appreciate it no problem you

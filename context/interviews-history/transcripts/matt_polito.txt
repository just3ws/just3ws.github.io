hi I'm white with you testing i'm here at stn am sitting out with matt pulido Matt was come a fixture in the Ruby community here in Chicago for several years on through T when he worked with on the tiger rubie in windy city rails conference but he uh he loved the cold northern climes go down to jacksonville florida enjoying a trophy so here you went out he had a pretty good body of

experience dealing with user groups here in chicago encompasses and jacksonville was a different role of jacksonville or would you experience it was the the area for the pool of developers is different mainly because it's not a Stetson area as the chakra here so the Ruby group that was in place already had a dwindling head count it was tough to get people together to promote started

whittling from run mob just you know every being seen together goes wrong why are you starting in the 50 or boat houses you know maybe 12 oh really when we were in habit in the city proper johnsonville you would see a spike okay so you can tell me more got area more likely people will come which was the exact same case in Chicago as well we have the el martes paintings which had

decent turnout but when we pursue the other group to the word Chicago exponentially we're going blue ice over your how injects develop your deal with a curb that's already having trouble pulling in people what it was so so it Absalom a part of that group oh just been around the people who run it and my experience here they decided to shut down was important

putting me the effort and time into it because people weren't done right so that undid summerlin center and then just recently one of our developers and ash project decided to take it upon himself to reinvigorate the community with these types of meetings and that just started last night eventually that seemed to be a very good turnout so excited that we may have someone who's

interested in fact that I'm interested so was there anything that people I mean invention density and having a city meeting versus suburban be they love showing that the one who's suburban similar not quite a separate but it is a Jacksonville is an interesting area I learned it's the largest continental black mass so even anything it's just texted Owens Jacksonville it's you yeah

and there's a lot of little pieces we are at the beach which is considerable distance from natural City you can take 40 or so minutes 0 radians so ignore it it's very similar to managers which we talked here to the people that went to those beautiful atmosphere so so you're looking at trying to figure out how they did people interested in ending the meetings again what what I lesson in

juvie took from that the demise of the previous group and our voyage eternity different lady in the new grew into things very similar to or they were done very similar to how we did that in chicago in always have except i'm better month so it becomes a friend o j4 be right always having the same location which is something we could take right now maybe the location is the

consistency be able to schedule consistency a location and only get your gear on the state's exactly I think that was rather the big successful thing was that consistency wasn't the thing that's happening with our editors also cater into beginners okay it tends to get more people in the sbarro yeah even have an interesting conversation about that image Expo that the people

who started user group want to do to be around like white people but and then you say you're starting and you have beginner to intermediate talks and then you kind of get to this this place where you don't you no longer want to have those talks you want to mask them but the things that are still happening are not been so then you start stop going and I think that that's the point where

head count starts to dwindle what people start on without word that we're going to interest them two types of times so it definitely is a balance because you need to have the beginner level talks to get new first blood but also find a way to people that are they're interested student a friend sustained efforts some above encouraging the more senior attendees to to be more active users

when they come in in the morning then they can start to teach yeah that would be a deal yeah I think that does often it doesn't have a lot here as well either well muscled chance of it up where you can get to a certain level already starter figure job and you know who I'm going to duty Sokka so well thank you for watching picking the run right down

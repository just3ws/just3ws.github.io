you hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at railsconf 2014 and i'm standing here with kyoto tomorrow who is a maintainer for the fluid v-log decoration and data data data collector I think you very much for taking the temple on my feet what what is a log aggregator collector yeah so flying D is a lot everyday turlock collector written in ruby and

its key features it's a really lightweight it's a very small girly program augmented by extensible plug-in architecture and its roads are pretty fast for for all sorts of locks a lot of our customers collect data for like Apache engine lot of genetics logs sis logs application logs and store them in like elasticsearch starvin Marvin Davey copy the data archive in yesterday and

so forth we started a product project two and a half years ago right and the commedia is going to be about like 50 regular contributors thousands of users in the world including slide sharing in tandem yeah yeah nintendo that's actually that's pretty cool i would do have it I mean are able to say how about using it or I'm actually not sure about like the actual like you know how to use

it but I think it's part of their like online games that are going on alkyl cake and basically like with all these companies logs are very very important they want to essentially manage it and they want to do all sorts of operations on them and before like a lot of like myself included we would RSA go ahead and script here and there that's like the number of data sources increase in

the number of storage system go to the store in the years increase the complexity increases like exponentially and we wanted 10 complexity keep everything simple and keep everything performing early so how did you get involved in this project yeah so I'm the Sodor Flynn d was originally created by my employer trigger data okay and I'm in play number 1 and when we first created

a thing we didn't think it was going to be big but one of our customers saw and they're like man like we're sisters open source right and we sort of druid inspiration from here okay who actually offers the service of the past okay they also open source a lot of stuff especially the stuff that runs on the client side so we did the same that can we started to grow organically not

right now we have like a little short of like 1800 stars and github and it's been steadily rising oh wow that's so it's pretty well adopted yeah I guess I sometimes these are self deprecating for that it is the lock collector that nobody's hard right but it's actually pretty cool yeah 1,800 people heard it I at least yeah so the the contributions is they are do you it's open source but

how do you how do you know for the community do you have people like contributing patches or yeah yeah yeah so right now I think there are 18 people with commit rights three of them come from us Church of data so fairly it's a very balanced community in the sense that we have commuters from like various companies and although we started originally in Japan trigger datas

founders originally from Japan but starting to spread like a lot of the questions these days come from like all parts of the world and at someone who constantly asked this question in the Middle English I'm glad to see this adoption going global and you know I it's always funny with some of these open source project for guys have no idea what he means well how did what's

the name I all ready to get drunk so originally we wanted to make various data sources talk to your virus data like back-end systems more fluently so the original author of the project Posada also wrote message pack which is a binary protocol he wanted to call it fluent and that's why I would give how user name is fluent but then he also realized that's not very Google yeah I

want any type flu and there's I go sort of like language or exams right so we just decided that D which traditionally stands for demon ok that's the or rsyslog ok so it's the unix t Yannick speak so that that's the story oh now it's when / fluid is a project something was interested in you know log aggregation collection as we start to have more people running multiple

servers and needing to aggregate data what would they do to check out like how the hell you recommend some bleep so our github repo is a good place to start as soon as our website friend you don't work and if you're familiar with really that I'm not everyone is from the committee gem install quality and you can get started right away is it like back to one debate or said either we

officially I think for one point number three and above and I think the newer versions were trying to slowly pressure can agree to it about yeah there is no it's too dad always is yeah Trudeau is the end our experimental bleeding edge right now and try to work off of two point one point one okay to create performance progress over the past few years and we want to take advantage of

that and as far as is putting the log aggregator is it something that's normal rails developer could probably work for ya so that's the other great thing about it fine d like when we want to tell people especially not familiar with like writing Ruby systems good isn't this is like system software it's hardly must be really hard to my clients actually I know a lot of engineers and programmers

or software writers write who learnt it right there may be myself included actually partially by writing bribing plugins for fluid be all real and there's only like a tiny bit of code that you need to write and everything is really what attracted so that you really don't have to repeat what other people have already built and yeah it's pretty easy to get started and you said that

earlier it's only about five thousand lines yeah that's a core yeah so it probably good idea for people to do like what thh recommended and that's just go read yeah source code it's done yeah it is a it is a pretty small program pretty well-documented not in the code but that is something that we're working I okay and there's a lot of documentation and the mailing list is

very active like when you post something within 24 hours someone's going to respond great thank you very much for taking time to max like me appreciate thanks user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations passera of information find out for yourself today at Utah State com

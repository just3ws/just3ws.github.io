user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great ideas in the tech community fascinating conversations plethora of information find out for yourself today yet you classic calm alright great so ahh ha ha one second hmm this is gonna be fun one ah hi it's mike with you tastic I'm an SCA 2013 and I'm sitting down with czech hunter chin

and Ron Jeffrey's our does say that in the right order I don't know which one so we'll find out in a second but they could talk about the nature of software development and and also we're on the panel yesterday abouts Oh what was a panel on software quality so so thank you very much for for taking the time to sit down with me I yesterday when your company again whose are you testing you

testing exactly i wouldn't guess that not a lot of people to say ugh tastic which is fine as long as you say it I don't really care um I'm just happy that anybody's even thinking about it um but it's a we do interviews of people who were doing interesting things in the software development community and I think you guys know this yeah I think you guys are known for one or two things

that are interesting and I certainly your talk on and software here at the end of SCA one of the things i would say i kinda got a kick out of was the the simplicity of your images everybody else tries to make these really super fancy typography slides whereas to convey the information simple drawings that could be clearly curvy understood and we're not very not very artistic not really

very good i'm not really not good but it reminded me of Ser Gregor just interviewed once you talk to ballads on harold and the purple crayon that you can use simple imagery metaphors to convey a lot of information without getting bogged down in in noise is this something that you tell us a little bit more like your thoughts on metaphor ha what that that I not messed

up but I just was curious is this something that that you've been using for a long time it actually is Ron bought a tablet pc I don't know eight or ten years ago and we started doing talks with just him drawing mm-hmm most of the graphs rest good it'll go up to do bad a little bit on that sort of that look and so would eventually I bought one and didn't use it as much as rod then it

sort of evolved until now we do stuff on ipad using a tool called paper which allows you to draw very simple things that's so it's a very national product I wish we've got some kind of kickback when we mentioned their name but you know it's a simple little drawing cool that it works really well in this environment because it's there's not much to it you pick a call where you

draw I supposed to all kinds of stuff that with a standard drawing good start that becomes well not have to learn this 21 yeah it's confusing well in yours but but we are as you see with the pictures you're still left with the fact that I can't draw Murray which is why the pictures are all so simple really but probably not i would really probably draw them simply even if I were like

able to draw something to look real because the idea is to catch attention illuminate the idea not have people stare at it the way they would stare at grade are and not listen to us because the poignant stressed listen to the words as well as see the pictures I'm sorry and our main purpose of giving a talk is to entertain ourselves it's up to the audience to entertain themselves

and so we enjoy having these funny little pictures and little things alone and in your in the way you did your presentation it was back and forth and back and forth that that's that I'm not I don't think I've ever seen anybody ping pong a presentation quite like that we've been giving presentations about this kind of subject I have actually the poster for

the first one we gave in 1998 so we've been doing this ? from not this talk but talking home together giving presentations together you know for 15 years and so we have developed a style which kind of works for us and oddly enough this is sort of Powys work anyway it turns out for example in we were coming back from the Netherlands and they interview you on the way out of the

country to see if you're a terrorist or something and they asked chatting with traveling together and he suggests until we came up and they kept the guy would ask us a question and one of us will start the answer and the other would finish the sentence and we said well why are you here and he said well we said we were there for teacher class is really what are you in business on your

business partners with partnerships accessory a pitcher partners who said they have a business park he said what kind of partners already and we kind of tried to tell him to do business partners and so we kept doing this ping-pong back and forth yeah I way being interviewed and at the end of the thing he said I think I know what kind of partner hahaha so apparently we're

too good at it to the next time i went to the netherlands beat up our wives and what probably i said nope something look with beards oh so we haven't been a long time we tend to finish each other's sentences and it works for us and we hope the works of the audience yeah and it seemed to definitely be well received and you know and just continue on with you the images I just wonder if with

some of the in a lot of the talks have observed people obsessing over typography and in creating these very what they think are professional looking we're really what I think it is is the message is what defines professional talk and professional communication do you see going to other peoples presentation for the very elaborate fonts colors I think it is an example of

our typography yeah see that the title is intentionally left blank if you have you run in my Henry oh yes you know we we intentionally don't do that I suppose you know I would think we probably think we're not very good at doing those things but if we spend a little bit of time I'm sure we can do as well as everyone else does well we divide various tools we did some stuff in

praise of years ago to discover that know when you when you do that everyone throws up at some time during the presentation not because what we were saying because of the two of the tool and so we most ho the one that Spencer is really messy is really cool we asked you know so she's going to get here over against you just like any ride at Disney or world and so we have gone to the

style mostly because I believe I believe that we've learned long ago that the movement and the words convey the story we come out of the old XP small talk world where crc with used according the the class responsibility collaboration technique and we were talking to crc by Ken Beck who was one of its inventors if you've ever learned that you've done this technique when I was going through

yeah Angeles learning Kim is doesn't write on the cards yeah the cards are blank really and he just moves around and talks about them because the words don't matter it's what you say in what's going on and after a while you know that this one that's the employee over there doesn't say anything listing for you and that one is the department or whatever their relationship is and so it's the

motion that gets see the information across so I think we kind of make that up to the point where in the middle of a conversation when it becomes clear that there should be another object people will point to a blank space and say this guy right here right because everybody's got it in their head and it's clear that the guy that you're talking about should be in

this hole or there isn't any object so you're trying to you're trying to get an idea into people's heads and the beautiful picture doesn't necessarily do that it's too good-looking people will will just look at it and we all take an illiterate and people are talking about the slide we pictured on months slide now we did do a talk on time where the the side was all done with pictures of

cats would lolcatz kinds of of titles on that worked well too but again it was just a little title yeah from which we spoke for a couple minutes and then went to another picture of the cat so it's a style that we think with the own seems to work for us and we hope nobody else steals it I guess we came to do all things this way if you were four so being able to go off the deep end and

iris to come in and do some sort of training for you if we might show up with a slide deck of 200 slides but we wouldn't show any of you we would draw everything live and talk about as we went along so those are like your reference more like your notes because people like to have something ah that they can walk let's take away walk away don't to mostly we say stuff that's in

them but we do it live because it's it's that that we think generates the knowledge if you're just standing there talking about the slide the people check out but if you're there talking to them and you're using some tool but help through them visualize what it is you're saying that works better and the more that's done in the moment that we think that wherever it is and so as you

described it you can do in talks for over 15 years as far as is the landscape of conferences and big technical get-togethers to discuss our industry jiminy anything that you've seen that's changed in particular that either for the better for worse yeah the the big conferences we're finding more and more boring not because of the many beginners who always show up because

there's always new people coming in the field and that's fine but because they have become so commercialized and so so many of the ideas are canned you know you must do this and follow this rule and use this tool on so many things like that that we find that the content is mostly not interesting to us and we think almost armful to too many of the people who show up there's a huge number

of people who are there from a big enterprise because they want to have a flag that says they're agile and don't have no intention or ability to do it or at least have no understanding and probably no ability to do so we're trying to come to smaller conferences like this one because there you can talk to people and they're interesting and they're more full of people who are

really excited about doing stuff now I don't know whether I believe this or not but I have a feeling that those commenters are going to be most to developer conferences it's going to be difficult to find a conference that isn't heavy in the developers that we find exciting I believe that's probably true because we are at the heart in our hearts where programmers we do the other

stuff because that's what money that's where the money is but should you listen well only developers only that but this is what we hear care about you know we come out of the XP world we're there to make the world safe for programmers and it turns out in order to make the world story for programmers you have to do a lot of stuff in those other areas talking with the business people and

educating them about stuff but in our hearts forever here trying to make the world safer programmers but and that just reminds me of a talk to Corey Gaines came a few years ago to a tia and it's talking about how developers need to take responsibility for a lot of these these needs and I kind of power of these craftsmanship concepts that were supposing and you know I kind of kicked

back saying well we can work all of us here in this room we are all agreed that we would like to all these things and they're good practices but the person with the purse strings is the business and we can talk all day about how great it would be to do tdd and do it but really gotta sell and that sounds like what you well the answer to that problem is something that

Jim Highsmith said 10 or 12 years ago it went ask you know how do i tell my managers how do I get permission to do this pair programming to do this tdd to do whatever the practice was and Jim said don't tell them they don't know what you're doing now anyway right do the right thing and they'll see better results they may ask you how you got that and you make up whatever answer is

appropriate right but you know do you need to tell them what editor using now you need to tell them how you know do they know how you're doing your workout no they don't well I mean as you know some shops do them like going to your market shots with microsoft developer shop and try to introduce Ruby it's not going to handsome no that's a whole another question same progression on you

know the question of how you to get programmers to work Lloyd programmers do is ought to if they're saying we have to ask management for permission to program that's where the problem is because you don't have to ask management for permission to program you might have to ask management for permission to use closure all right you should um but you do your craft no one has the right to

tell you you can't do your craft so there's some kind of fear thing and I think I think particularly young your programmers who haven't gotten to the point to being jaded to the one who's saying I'm just going to do the stuff in the rest you can walk off um feel like they're supposed to be told what to do you know because when you were working on McDonald's I told you what to do that

ain't it this is professional this is I am the guy who doses you don't tell your surgeon how to cut and you don't tell your program around a program so but people have to learn that they have to learn that it is their job thing well and that's you know what this movement is about is to use to get people to know what it is and to know how to do it in its speaking of

experience of getting through a certain point in your career you know i I've had my wife see what are you going to do when your effort or 50 are you still gonna be a programmer and i'm not mistaken I believe you gentlemen might be approaching 50 or so and in yes then I see that fills above imagine and not as well I'm it's in the rearview mirror um but I as I walked up to your to your

table to invite you to come for an interview you're working on code right there at the desk in so obviously you're still a very active in the developer community for people who are looking down the road and whether or not there's a career in development past 30 on wall pets 30 myself but you know my belkin into the 40s and 50s and beyond do you work Jimmy he obviously might have some

insight well hot I would not care to work for a living um this is good because no one would hire me because I'm not the sort of person that works well if people tell me what to do I imagine I could have programmed as long as I wanted to but what happens is that your eyes get bigger you at some stage early on in your career you realize you can't program at all by yourself and so you

have to program with a couple of other people that means you have to learn and talk to them you know maybe even look him in the eye once mom you have to fake that oh and as you grow you don't just continue to grow to say I really want to be even better at emacs you grow to want more things and those things might be bigger products they might be that you find joy in bringing up younger people

and so instead of just being a senior programmer on the team maybe you begin to become a mentor maybe you become a mentor / many teams so it's a whole spectrum of world there I think it would be silly to imagine at age 25 that you have any clue at all what you'd like to do at least 35 something is going to appear in front of you that you're going to be like oh

that's cool go and get that squirrel right huh so I I don't think you have to worry about that yeah if you're good at what you do stop live do they will promote you it was it he keeps getting things on there all the teams and have him on him get things up we should make him into a manager we should make it into get as wet you got a little careful because you might not choose to go there

what you might you know if you could manage teams the way an agile guide would manage them it could become a good job and it sounds like kind of what you're saying on in the management doesn't have to be mentioned in the way of being a middle manager but it can be different like as you try mentoring or working with other people in a different capacity you think it's so might have

the reminder I wonder whether conventional hierarchic management is going to be around you big companies it will be but because it takes a long time for those things to die but if you look at what really gets hot new wonderful products done it's a bunch of people coming together and then they get funding and then they find somebody to sell it and they do all these things

it's a much more interactive much less conventional command and control management that happens and so I think the opportunities are both more human and less like administration and stuff like that I've lived my life essentially seeking local Maxima I've done what appeared to make me happy with in my short range of you and oddly enough that seems to have worked out really well

your cookie that is not my cookin would you like it your one just local next Monday you know I the world is too complex a place to make any long-term plans as far as I can figure out you know I do what makes me happy every day and when what I'm doing stops making me happy I try to look around see where we're within 10 feet long will I be happier well it's a that's a tricky one

because all of us who are technical know that local optimization could leave you in a bad place you know where there was really great stuff over here and all you did was become vice president of Microsoft um well okay the world isn't quite like that the world isn't a single optimization process you something badly now the world is multi-dimensional and so it might really be that the next

thing that happens to you is that you hear about an interesting conference to go to you go to the Simpson conference and you run into some interesting people and they say what are you doing say I'm working with a sucky job back in Detroit and they say you know we really ought to think about what we're doing to say what are you doing we're building this spaceship and you all of a sudden you

bounced into an entirely different dimension right so it isn't it is local optimization you know and I think it was just I just cruise around going wherever the little krill or tastes just as much the moment but you know every now and again something happens it bounces you to a new dimension me you just do stuff so and any conferences going smaller going to that local what do you ever go

cheese room staff my history point user group services we don't hang with them we go and talk with you know give a talk at them but we mostly don't go and hang out user groups there are a couple local to us and they always seem to meet at some time what I'm involved in doing something else and it's mostly just bad luck we're going to go give a talk we're actually going to show up and do

I don't know exactly what is in January that one of the local groups in ann arbor but mostly we stopped the local reason some reason we don't go to those one of the things I Darcy lazy guy thing well there's that but one of things I don't like about and i noticed this at the open spaces that we went to it Dave husband's def jam that was last month here if we go to an open space we have a

tendency to take it over because we have so much to say about it we can't stop you might stop ourselves we know the answer some and everything we do and and we're not really very good at coaching answers out of other people that's just gotten our deal and so have a user group we always wind up being more of a focus then we would like to me it's fun to go on the internet you talked already was a

user group of people just talking yes it doesn't work first we don't know you know if that's going to happen we would just soon they came to our office at the coffee shop and talk to us about their problems to hear what we had to say money so for some reason that particular thing doesn't work for us but I think it's because we're I don't mean to say we're above all others but we're at a

different place in our work and the user groups want to be kind of homing genius they want all be kind of the people who are right now trying to fight their way up the to get the company to do something or other people are all right now be an entrepreneur all whatever we're often this other dimension that kind of doesn't fit with them fudgy and you find that maybe smells when you're

trying to have a conversation people because of your reputations might be more prone to just two fern we like that part ah I suppose I suppose I mean I'm sure must get old you know when you're come on challenge me well what I can do that they might we might lose them yeah I suppose that happens particularly since at least one of us has a reputation

really nasty and tough we're both really teddy bears but there might be a little bit of that and but not the one of us was also raised by Jesuits and therefore can argue any subject on either side and so it's really not a good idea yes to challenge us unless anybody jumping you gotta ask a challenging questions it's really challenging you know don't come in again and say what should I do you

know refactoring doesn't work because I don't know how to do it it's like yeah it doesn't work because you don't know how to do it because we know that answer you we've seen so many people learn how to do these things that this conference is all about and seen they always benefit and I heard somebody in the lunch line yesterday saying we tried TDD and it just doesn't work for our kind of

software it's like no see there isn't any kind of software or you can't do that if you're willing to invest in to learn how to do it there's somewhere it's very difficult I seem to have to be inventing TDD for the programming thing you cause program with but if you want to do it you can do it and it will it will give you some benefit isn't it possible so we will tend not that kind

of challenge doesn't work very well because we know every argument we've been doing this for 15 years again and so we just crushed the poor devil and it was cruel we don't like to be cool even today even's there I did interview with another gentleman amitesh player who was on the neck PSD foundation and he talked about how they'd even have any colonel called any Carl which allows them to do

testing against a mock colonel so that they even can test unit tests and do even security test against this kind of mock Colonel for Neffe SC and if you can unit test the colonel for an operating system so you can keep it yeah you can s anything so that kind of just throws that argument right out but again I think maybe that just just don't know and that is really the deal on so much

so much online resistance to doing some new thing is that I don't know and I don't like not knowing I don't like going back to the beginning who wasn't it talked yesterday about going into a new language you sorta have to start all over and yeah you know ken and you don't you saw have to start over and I don't like that feeling of discomfort I have the luxury that I program and so many

languages that I know it's in there to be found right and so I'm a little bit more comfortable but as chat knows if it comes down to okay now you got to install all that crap on your Mac so that you can actually run Ruby and you have you don't be able to load up every version of Ruby Ruby ends and all they know all those little stacks I know that when I go to the internet say how do you

install that it will have perfectly clear instructions and I will do exactly those instructions are my work yeah and it is really irritating and so I resist doing some things like that because I don't how to do it I think that's always what happens I think we will resist refactoring cosas don't how to do it so it doesn't work very well let's go if you're not very good at it yet nobody

likes to be told you're doing it wrong but the fact remains when we're not performing well there's something we're not we're doing wrong and that's that you just have to accept that it isn't the world the computer didn't break your program or I know who broke the program that was broken when you came up to us I did and there's no doubt in my mind that it isn't that my ipad is broken or that

suddenly codya doesn't work with language lua doesn't include if statements I know I broke this right yes that's probably gonna do well thank you very much for taking the time I know it was a pleasure hope we're going to edit this down to about two minutes odd oh thank you very much Matty no time all right user groups with lots to say interviews and more no way sharing great

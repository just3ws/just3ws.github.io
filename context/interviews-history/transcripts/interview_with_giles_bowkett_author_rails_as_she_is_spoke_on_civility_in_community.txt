hi it's Mike again with you tastic today I'm sitting at what Giles bowkett I you might know him on Twitter is jealous goat boy he's been around in the Ruby community pretty much since well since there's been a Ruby community he's a really active Foss developer he's done written the book rails as she spoken and recently written on very interesting blog post about respect in the community

about having a sense of decorum in our in our communications with each other thanks gels for for taking the time to sit down really appreciate it sure sure glass being here so what what inspired that post a movin what was the post about again just for those who haven't read it uh I think I don't actually recall the exact title but it was like a simple protocol to enforce or enable uh

you are not your code right which was that that blog post that went around a little while and it was a little unnecessarily controversial because the context in which it was introduced even though the the essential idea the blog post was I think very valid and that you know oh sorry I would say there for those who didn't know that you're not sure code was about some people severely

criticized code there was an RV m verse rbn and then there was some comments about a person who had contributed some some yeah yeah oh look I want to give the back story then um so the back story was that RBM was like the you know probably still is the dominant ruby version manager which stands for and uh Sam Stephenson I think somebody created a version called a will created a

variant a similar thing that worked differently called rbn and uh introduced it with some snark in the readme which they then removed after there was sort of like a Twitter drama about it uh and then you know you are not your code came as a blog post from Sam Stevenson maybe like two days after he tweeted that um you know he found it very frustrating that every time he

talked about the differences between our vm an RBM people started talking about how they felt that Wayne's eggwin who created our vm was a good guy and they liked him and they didn't want to be mean to him and you know he he wrote this big blog post about you know you are not your code if I criticize your code it doesn't mean I hate you it just means i will I i think this code should

be different and it was a totally valid point but in context it kind of just didn't um it didn't quite work because when I read that I I didn't feel like oh wow you know he's saying this because he wants everyone to be more you know nice it felt like he was just sort of evading the consequences of I mean if you if you tell everybody my project exists because that other guys project sucks yeah you

know it's just not cancerous it's hard to spin that as you're the only yeah it's hard to have a conversation at that point you know so what I said you know in my blog post was like you know if he had just you know said like I'm sorry I was a dick about the guys project but it happened a year ago and I still believe that my project has some valid technical benefits and I want to just put that

part behind you know so I'm going to like really I don't know if you have a Rapala days in the first place but hopefully and just reapplies to permanent permanently clear the air you know that might be more productive and during during the course of this post I refer to mr. Stevenson as mr. Stevenson uh because you know and I elaborate it later in the post that I don't know him

personally right I don't want to write a blog post about like you know the reason this is a problem is because this guy sin is a big douche bag you know cuz that's not gonna solve anything right so it's just more of the same yeah it's just more the same and I'm like why not uh you know say like if you're going to criticize somebody's behavior online uh do them you know some

some sort of uh default respect showing right by referring to them as you know mr. Stevenson or if it was an argument with some wealth you know miss someone else right and that way you know it really is like a communications protocol and it's been around since the dawn of time you know as I'm not really but you know for several hundred years at least it makes me think of martial arts how

the gold market is to get into a ring and beat the hell out of each other but right baby start off like yeah you respect that you're gonna fight and then there's certain you don't do this you don't do that I mean I think even in the MMA they they have certain things that are kind of you know do that because that's yeah that poor decorum you know that it's reminder that yeah we are

sometimes were in competition my you know rd our ideas are something that we create and we want to put out there and sometimes we don't like an idea we would like our idea to be adopted yeah I'm sure mr. Stevens wanted his idea to be adopted and taken on as the primary goal it's the way yeah well sorry just uh it's actually Stephenson mr. she was okay yeah but and and he has by the way

just you know to say like another reason i wanna you know make sure that if I disagree with him I slow show respect is because he I think he wrote prototype if i recall correctly which you know very very influential he's been a slouch yeah no slouch and and how as well i think but yeah sorry you were saying i was just saying that that's uh well i was talking about the martial arts analogy

but in going back to what you're saying about when somebody says you are not your code a lot of it is in the delivery and the demeanor of the person saying it I think about i interviewed ah lian cursing and when he says you're not your coat it's for man it's okay you hear not your code it's don't worry about it that's really we're at that time when you wrote it and it's

great you know that's let's just you know it's kind of a very the dude asked its kind of lebowski ask but um and also think about another person who's contributed a and E luster who created a canned some other tools mostly in the pearl community he is awesome yeah and ex act was better than grep so I mean a little bit of like a little bit of tease a little bit of a jab I'll delivered in

a very congenial jovial way and when somebody came to me when I interviewed him he was talking about a person was creating a tool called better than ack and they worried that he would be offended and he's like no no that's I know it's a worthy goal yeah and it's good be better but you know that it was delivered with in a way that could still be interpreted as is humorous but I

think yeah yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna go out on a limb here and I'm going to say sometimes certain people and it tends to be in the rails community that I've noticed have a little bit of an acerbic way of delivering I'm trying to say the nicest way possible that they can be a little bit caustic in their opinions yeah there is there's a lot of that and you know it doesn't really take very

much of it to get a whole atmosphere started and once you have that atmosphere it kind of seems like you know you've got well it just it takes the fun out of things right like that that um I don't know if it's anger or you know uh just just like a really harsh approach to time management or something but when you see that stuff you know sooner or later you're going to

have to call somebody on it and you know it might not be fun to do it like you know in an ideal world it would all just be humor uh you know but people don't like me to make you know if someone has a serious mentality people don't like being made fun of right right and like when you know like when that acerbic vibe is introduced you know you might be able to diffuse the effects

like you know I'll I don't want to dance around the issue one of the major sources of intense speech in the rails community is the creator of rails David Hyneman are handsome and you know if you want to criticize mr. Hyneman Hanson uh there is the somewhat um obvious challenge that he is an amazing programmer and you know I mean I personally my life was changed for the

better by using his software yeah bye bye a staggering degree I've learned a great deal from you know from watching what he did and looking at his code and so on and so forth um and I I really feel that there has to be some way to prevent like that you know you've got in Ruby in general we've got this notion of matches nice so we're nice and if you can't have that as like a guiding thing

then maybe making sure to to demonstrate respect for someone who disagree with can kind of settle things down in another way you know like humor is a really good way of defusing tension like I I made fun of mr. haniver Henson uh with a dramatic reading of rails as omakase which is a blog post he wrote and I was like you know this will probably not do great things for my

relationship for that particular individual I I doubt my respect for him in general is going to be readily apparent in my you know because the reading is i exaggerated it and made it funny I hope right and and certainly some people found it funny which is what you hope for uh and in so doing I you know I I wouldn't necessarily say that I was hugely strategic about it but I did

kind of hope that to some degree like bye-bye put by making it funny by making the rails omakase thing funny hopefully that can act as like a us what are they calling a firebreak when you have like all the all the area around a fire range yes yeah anyway and nothing can burn in that area yeah to prevent to prevent the sort of uh the acerbic fury from spreading you know in like creating a

whole toxic atmosphere what's a limit of make fun of myself before anybody else can make fun of me for me you know you by by removing those those that layer of self seriousness and self so yeah yeah by creating an atmosphere of fun yeah and it tears it down so that way it nobody is has to feel like they're approaching you it just you expose yourself and you put yourself out there

and you've you've made fun of yourself and you've exposed a weakness therefore you've made yourself a little bit more human a little bit more vulnerable or some people i think still want to have that that wall between them in the world for whatever reason yeah and and well I worry about that a little because this whole idea of like you know mr. this and miss that Ashley feels like a little bit

of a wall um so I don't know I mean well then typically it's the bowing it's the it's the it's not with it within the martial arts it's a sign of respect you're not bowing I mean you bout to the instructor at a deference but to each other to your peers you about not to that individual but to the environment that you're and yes anything that you're in this

environment and you're in this mode of thinking you're not some and that's one of the subtle things it took me a long time it's as much of a developer I've as I've turned into you a couch potato developer I have a background in martial arts in my youth and it was one of the things that you you learn to understand that it wasn't about the person it was about the the actual interaction itself

you're respecting that you're in this rain you expecting here in the dojo or the dojang for taekwondo in and you you use these formal things so that way you don't accidentally really get into a fight really sorry I'm gonna just no worries so I just thought the dr yeah yeah cuz you know why I mean that like I haven't got a whole bunch martial arts it did do a fencing and like a smidgen a

Taekwondo when I was little right um but I remember you know that like the solute before the the sword fighting and you know part of it was because you wanted it to be over once you got out of the ring right yeah you me and you didn't want it to be like some big thing and I also i don't know i talked about in a blog post that i got it from uh I went to this school for a year which is where

I also did the fencing and it was actually a convention there that in classes you know you would I mean you would literally have a you know religious people and atheists discussing the Bible in this school right right and there was a class of you know who's about reading great books and one of the great books is the freaking Bible and this is like a really you know people it

even be a very personal thing yeah yeah and in order like how do you create an atmosphere where people who disagree about such an incredible fundamental thing can still learn from each other right and and one of those things it's like let's let's show a baseline level of respect to you know I I don't know if it's gonna catch on right I don't know if I'm gonna

be able to say like a you know two years from now everybody's calling each other you know mr. this and ms that you know every ring you're bringing back the Victorian era is what yeah yeah like I don't know this is gonna sound hoopskirts your monocle is of course right like that would be you know um kind of a strange accomplishment i'm not sure if it would be a good thing you

know but like yeah and i'm not gonna stop swearing right cuz i swear all over the place i'm kind of surprised I made it this far without you know without without saying anything like that but uh you know frankly like I even worried that it might be a situation where you know people who aren't writing Ruby or who write Ruby but also write other languages might be like what's going on

with these people that they can't even talk to each other anymore and they gotta like you know I must put on my assuage and refer to as mr. this and you know like it seems a little crazy well I am I think the Ruby developers have always been come to the weirdos always doing yeah yeah they're nomadic if it it's gonna be anything that's going to be dramatic but yeah well I mean and it

is it is a little bit of drama right it's like a little ritual uh you know as opposed to just saying hey dude you know but like that seems to me is like one of the most acceptable um weirdness is one of the most um you know non-destructive eccentricities you can possibly cultivate right it's like I am you know too nice to people right that would be a great problem to have yeah well the end

it is one of the things that I I also didn't start off in a ruby a world I came from month on that development which was very very corporate very very normal but in a different way um can I can I just interrupt one I know I talk a lot but always one thing I absolutely hate about corporate environments cannot stand is when people like you know I'm going to use my corporate

position to tell you what to do and I'm going to call you you by your first name but there's also this little atmosphere that if I'm like you know mr v.p right or whatever or CEO guy you can't call me by my first name right right and a power play yeah it is and it's like this business casual thing because technically you do know the CEOs first name right it's just like you

can't use it for some a secret reason yeah you know and I just feel like if you're gonna be in a situation where you know have you basically in rails as ohmic on say you know mr. Hanneman Hansen pulled rank right he just said it's my project I'm gonna do what I want everything is I can totally respect that I could totally see myself making the same session if it was my project you

know and yeah frankly like the guy transformed my career right transformed my experience as a developer raised my standards forever as to what developing could be you know if he wants to say it's my project you know tough okay yeah but if you're if you're gonna pull rank then maybe you know I mean mr. was at some point probably a type of rank right there was like sir lord mr. you know uh

if you're a butler you refer to you know it like okay this is a massive tangent but watching batman movies whenever there's a Batman story where Bruce Wayne is a kid it makes me very very angry because they always have Alfred referring to Bruce Wayne as you know mr. Bruce right or master wing uh actually they don't do that but they should like if you're a butler and you're speaking

to your like you know lords child you refer to it as it you for to them as master right even though their kid when they grow up they become mr. this is a very strange thing you know it's a relic of victorian era yeah I think that's portal 2 inch I don't think that master didn't send it out no no no no we're leaking offenses no Batman movies and their historical and accurate

see no no that guy running around with a cave and the flying bat wing it so it is I accept the cape and and like you know the spaceship that he just drives around New York in yeah you know miss miss using Victorian era titles you know if they're subtle differences I'm sure even in the Victorian era there was there was always some little subtle tea that that would get somebody hung up on something

literally I'm not probably um but uh so just you know kind of coming head to wrap I want to actually go backwards in history a little bit and you've you've been involved in open source software so you have a perspective so when you writing this blog post you're not just coming out of the blue and saying oh I'm some butter use been outside of this community and this is just what I see is

going on here I mean you've been doing Ruby developments since before rails right uh no not quite I mean okay when you talk about like I wanted to interrupt earlier but I didn't um cuz he said like doing Ruby development since the beginning and if you look at someone like I don't know Abdi grammar Jim why Rick right they really were around before ribs uh me I I was brought to

Ruby by rails technically in 2005 but we're talking like December 28 2005 so really 20 dad something's done yeah I was it was rails hero dot 13 um and i did spend a bunch of time just you know on you know Ruby uh for its own sake because you know it's neat yeah and you know with odd and not just speaking about languages you were speaking about Archaeopteryx am I even close um no

that's absolutely completely correct okay great and the that that's written in all JavaScript correct no I've ported it to JavaScript it was written in Ruby I did some tricks to make an act a little like JavaScript though I used lambda all over the place and an alias el to lambda so because you can do that with JavaScript you just put a function

anywhere and I wanted to do that I didn't even realize it was like JavaScript esque at the time that I was doing it but then i ported it most of it not all of it 22 CoffeeScript and i renamed it Clyde this one syllable feel glad Stubblefield yes yes the funky drummer yes okay I think that's where I was trying to tie it into it I was I was I I I brought this in the last second

before we started the interview was the was that you had talked about Archaeopteryx and Clyde and I was just forming are you one of those people that is post Ruby or are you still doing Ruby oh no um like last year I did a ton of Ruby all this year like I have a bit i'm still hacking some projects in my own but you know all this year is an entire month right now all I'm doing is writing

and creating like videos and stuff like that but you know using Ruby and yeah there's no chance in there but like the nodejs music stuff is really more of a side project like that I'd be a day certain are you doing a bee today a thing I'll be today like you are you creating because I notice on your site you know today's beats oh uh no so like I also have another thing called DJ go

boy which is a Twitter account and initially I started that like 2009 I think and the goal was to make a new beat every single day and I got the idea for that from Courtney gascon from entp and it was it was a really good idea and it made me much better making music but the majority of those are just made you know like I have like a synthesizer and actually for you know or 3.5 or whatever

actually i don't i don't know how many synthesizer i have cuz force my head head i got like like four on here yeah but on your ipad yeah yeah mean you might like the iPad is amazing we had a synthesizer for like five dollars but for virtualization yeah yeah yeah and some of them are really amazing but epic tangent point is like some of them I create like in the you know in

the normal way that a person would create music and then some of them are created with code and I recently just got Clyde able to do bass lines as well as drones and I don't use it as much as I use the typical tools but I think once it's a little home because I kind of put it aside for a while I was doing all kinds of other things for a while um but I think it's actually really going to be

useful because I was finding that the music that I was making this more exciting to listen to because when you you know you know how when you write code and you are actually really understanding every little bit because sometimes you're right code and you're like ah it worked you know and other times you know exactly what it's doing and it does exactly what you expect and

you you know you have it under test and you're very familiar with every little last piece there is a wonderful feeling of clarity that you get in that situation and I was having a little bit of that making music with code whereas the normal way of making music either involves like actually just playing an instrument in which case you do have that same feeling or um using like a GUI

right like ableton live or logic pro their various programs and using those programs uh you know you're working through a GUI and the GUI kind of introduces like a layer of distance right because you've got you know uh I know what I want the computer to do and now I have to find out what metaphor that the user experience designers chose for that and its really nice to you know

just go straight to the code and just be like I want you to play this note at this moment I want to have this philosophy and you know in upcoming episodes is going to be more stuff blah blah blah but it is very satisfying okay great well thank you very much for taking the time to you sit down and chat it's been really interesting thanks very glad speaker

hi I'm Mike I'm sitting here with Dave Thomas with the go to conferences I'm user group series he's here in Chicago to your do some scouting I don't I can't say anymore but I you want to take a moment and and give Dave a chance to talk about the go to group and what exactly you guys are looking to do what are conspiracy yeah what is the great conspiracy to go to you so a few years

ago it did mark a small company tripod couldn't afford to send all their really talented people to the u.s. to the top us conferences so they did when they started the course they all five of them move it now it's just a large a couple hundred so yet you have your own kind of that so they basically side they have their own conference and they realize that this was actually pretty expensive

and so they said well maybe we couldn't share that with the community and Argos and Denmark which is a fairly small town actually and so for last 15 years what used to be called the cow conference or Jala we would connect yeah was born and I got involved will know about seven years ago I did a keynote and turned into sushi did you already were going to get married to the conference so I did

but the big thing would like about the conference is that it has a completely independent rogram committee and so the vendors can screw with the content right since its raw text on type the best speakers and very simple system for voting if you maybe some people to come but basically that's part of the cute con San Francisco keep them on dinner part of the series of conferences

run by go to conferences and as well as the all-time Kristen Australia which I actually and I I think it's really interesting that you're working you're trying to avoid sponsorship entanglements and I use the word entanglement salamat well consistently yeah so the first time we attended to the conference in the area the large traditional sponsors typically sort of

go hey yeah yeah what do you mean you don't want to Billy Bob borrow seconds prior chief evangelist Mellie the wants to do that so it's usually kind of a rough time the first time out but then they find out that the developers really well with there being so right basically the idea between behind the whole conference to reach the space and just have great speakers that you typically

wouldn't get in your community leave and not that every community has great support that you know lots of great be sure guy only after get your copy shabby but now you got lots and so on I many many are good friends of mine so but the idea is to make a kind unique event so that people can actually see the speakers and interact and network in their community and we've been every now

run it in Amsterdam Copenhagen art was Denmark as q con in London and San Francisco is yo in Australia and that this year in Prague as well and everything goes well we'll be a hand chicago's 1 813 we're actually just here looking at venues we're looking to kick on with us miss county didn't what's up with the our first go to night and what we try and do is basically work with the

user groups to see what what user group with speakers they want to do since we're really you know the key thing is to companies or groups are really the people that don't drive things in the community and so find out what sort of speakers they want and given that we feed that to our PC and they decide and then we always have to try and get some sponsors

to pick up the tab for the seeker do you go with the use firms because they tend to be and I'm giving kind of a fresh but they tend to be kind of the people that more out there and engage with them I'm a technology am i seeking exactly there isn't people who are the advocates and they're typically have a lot of the brighter people they're the ones that are being at whether you should be using

ember Jas right now why using that old back there it is so they're really on top of them the other thing is they're networkers and then you'll appreciate you coming along and short notice and connecting with people and they really share the values the other thing is they tend to be discerning customers so you know in the end we're not really interested in trying to compete with

other commercial imagine are we interested in competing with user group of man so I'm general if there's a user group event that we can help amplify that or push it or we can take a local speaker and push them out to it to one of our conferences another city you know anything like that that really works at develop a minute and that was an interesting thing it it looks like you

go into an area and start off with a group but in order to stay sponsor free charge a fee to come to the group I personally I had always assumed groups before but I'd love it there's actually a large number of groups that charge money tomm membership like a dues more than actually like a feel it will win are we do just go two nights really just to bring one of our speakers in and do

that and we charge I think in Chicago started by five dollars and they really only reason for doing that is it we found it to be kind of impossible to control the numbers so if you're trying to get a venue and things like that the other thing is that you know yeah you talk to any of our Australian years as they tell you you I've always got thirty-five dollars with a beer and

pizza my five dollars so yeah I think I do know there's a religion groups and we just decided that for our point of view we really can't manage the venue of the space in terms of how much how many people are coming and so on and it typically if you ask people for something then you can kind of give me the head count numbers and things like that but it's not it's really not the

intended be an option but it's not and we don't have a membership thing we don't really spam people really it's just a just a really new one even a year in the city it's a conference and we have no other there's no other interest the group doesn't really exist so typically what we try and do is pour we do a go tonight the first one we're doing we're having just achieves a GTO

fascial right at the key designer react no it's building race so he's going to be coming here and will you know Mark Logan in the airline usual group and we're hoping they'll all be able to morning but we're typically what we're trying to do is you know meet with user groups and say look we've got a speaker you like we might be able to get for you I'm gonna try and maybe put it together

would say okay maybe we can get the Ruby the JavaScript guys together because occasion yeah and said okay yeah here's a speaker to that we could bring together and we could do a go tonight around that we would pick up the cost for the for the speaker that's really that's why you should look I really do hope to see at may 2013 I go to conference to be able to come out just

great that but you can't you know thank you very much for 14 a time to thank you much but Michael's been great and we've had very pleased you're the reaction in the Chicago we actually started doing this I was doing a lot of work here in Chicago in 2009 and we got talked into this then but we got off doing some other things but I think we're back now well that's what is all right thank you

very much

hi it's Mike here with you tastic and I'm sitting down while not really sitting down we're on a skype call but i'm talking with joel claremont who runs in milwaukee PHP users group hi Joel thanks for taking the time to chat today oh hi so you run the Milwaukee PHP users group how long has that group and around what what what do you guys do it to PHP group so the group was formed in this

for 2009 and actually I was not the person who formed it so it was I had a note on meetup expressing an interest in PHP groups in my area but for whatever reason I never took the initiative to start the group so anyways I was on vacation in Florida was december two thousand nine somebody started the group Aaron's array and like within five minutes of me getting that email i

joined and so we kind of started at the i have to give him credit for her actually i'm down the money and meet up in getting it started so our first meet up was in january okay because i was down at december down in Florida for the whole month um i think we had like six or seven people at our first meetup and we were a bit ambitious and trying to do it twice a month right so we were going

to meet on the second for tuesday i think we did that through summer and in summer it really got difficult because you know it's wisconsin we actually had some sunshine we have to get people to out to take advantage of some additional free time what stuff so but we've been going strong at least once a month in second tuesday of the month is when we've been meaning to last couple of

years okay and what was it that made you want to do it twice a month was was there a particular reason for that um naivety I don't know it was a it was something we were both interested in doing hey I think it just well once a week seemed way too much and I guess in our initial estimation once a month seemed like maybe not enough part of it too was maybe somebody couldn't make it

2-1 meet up but they could make it the other this at least most people could make it at least one a month but um you know finding speakers venue wasn't a problem we have a pretty staple location that we can meet at whenever we need but I'm finding speakers topics getting people you know excited about it just twice a month was a bit too much but once a month seems to

be really nice nice fit yeah it's it's a kind of a common pattern to have that once a month you can just kind of plan for its where if it's twice a month it's I'd have to like what you said with the speakers you'd have two different contents and well and to make it even crazier our initial format was we had two presentations for meeting so our thought was who try to have like a kind

of a either of beginners or maybe more business oriented one soft skills for the first half and the second half we have a little more in depth a little more hands-on and now our format has been just one presentation with a little more focus on group interaction people hang out more afterwards and in exchange ideas help each other with problems so yeah we early on it was for a month that

was that was really tough to do yeah so now it's more tech and then social okay and what kind of when you were doing the soft skills that was kind of interesting most I haven't heard that very often for many groups was that something that was well received or you said you kind of stopped doing that was it just flat always we still have some pots that are not super technical you know we've had

talks on more business side of things like how to find clients freelancing we even have something because PHP is a web development language primarily will have stuff on JavaScript frameworks or you know is it runs the full spectrum it's not all you know this is purely PHP code and that's it that we talked about right and I so like do you have a pretty vibrant community how many people do you

get per month so there I just pulled up on meetup we are at 262 members right now it sounds like a lot um average meet up I would say is probably a 15 to 20 okay ed I think on our high-end me five so in the three years we've been running once a year we've been able to bring in somebody kind of from outside of the of the region so our first year we had somebody from zend who's one of

the big corporate entities in the PHP world he pull up from Texas and gave a nice talk last year we had Keith Casey who was representing twilio which you know they do a lot with the community and in api's and so he came up and I think he's out of time to steal and then this year we had somebody from orchestra or engineered is who bought Orchestra they had somebody come out and speak to

us just two months ago so those 10 are more people are you are you getting sponsors that bring them in or were they in town for a conference and they came in talked or um kind of well in all three cases their corporate entity sponsored them okay you know so that and sponsored Kevin when he came twilio sponsored Keith and engineered sponsored Liz when she came so that's worked out

great yeah as a small user group we could not afford flight people in them up night and so that's that's the grain plus they usually come with goodies like giveaways and raffles and things like that too so that's best part of what the appeal is um an engineer even bought us pizza and food and stuff too so that also brings people to the meetings I mean little things like that because we

would typically have our meetings at 6pm so people are just getting off of work maybe haven't eaten yet so knowing that there's pizza or something there makes it a little bit more likely that they'll want to show up before we were talking on the interview you kind of mentioned that you're starting to dabble in some other platforms and languages and are going to those user groups and

conferences just curious odd you know what is it that you're you're looking into in which communities are you starting to go to what has been your experience okay yes so in august i had a little bit more free time i sold my consulting company and one of the things that I always wanted to dig deeper into was Ruby he and I i I'm familiar with the language I

even maintained a small open source project in Ruby for a few years but never really used it as part of my my work as part of my day-to-day job so I decided to get started um we have in milwaukee Ruby group here right in town meets once a month as well so I've been going to that in August we also had Madison Ruby which was was a the first Ruby focused conference I've been at and

it was just fantastic so I highly recommend going today I will be there again next year and and even I was last month I presented at the Milwaukee Ruby group on Ruby motion which is a tool chain for building iOS apps in in Ruby's so I've been enjoying it I'm still not really using it for my day-to-day work I have an iOS project and working on right now with Ruby motion but like I have

even gotten into rails yet or anything like that so I'm still early days but I am I find the community to be pretty welcoming nobody has a booed me yet for Santa PHP developer haha it's been pretty friendly that's good that's good I'm overall as far as like the content or the approaches there been any kind of difference that you've seen between a PHP focused group or community versus

going to the Ruby community yeah you know I guess some once they have noticed that's real popular in the Ruby community is notion of pairing I'll being able to just you know tap somebody's shoulder and say hey you know can can repair for half hour right and maybe not you don't even know that persona I did that at Ruby Madison just to kind of try it out right get outside

of my comfort zone a little bit and i was i was amazed um i also did a little bit of ruby interaction at a code retreat and that's was really my first experience doing a full day of pair programming and i loved it and actually that's something i'd like to see kind of grow in other communities too i think the PHP community could benefit from that

other communities could benefit from that as well yeah there it's fun but those those countries are intense that's good that's done that's not a normal pairing experience all right I shouldn't say that but well I didn't mean thank you very much for taking the time to sit down and chat yeah you're welcome

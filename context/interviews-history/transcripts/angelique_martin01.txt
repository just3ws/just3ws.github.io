this for a couple years now but well first I know you're really busy so I appreciate you taking the time to sit down with me but ah so 2013 you've been doing this for a few years what if what has it that you've learned over the last couple years that has affected 2013 and how is 2013 may be different than what she did in 2012 um well the differences were actually pretty subtle the the main

concept of the short talk with the long breaks for networking remained what we did this year is that we try to change the schedule a little bit so that the second day would start a little bit later right so we could have a code and coffee session supposed to allow for more technical time we've reintroduced the 5k that we had three years ago this is actually a CNAs fit here and we used

to go back and forth nerrit's been seein a slide has been organizing it for I would say the past three years and then one year before so this is really the fourth time that we do this so um the the big picture stays the same and is really terrible that's the world but the idea is to well hopefully the conference make it well I think it was really terrible I was like me and I

was like I said well that's like to reiterate yeah no no it is it is a word or at least again for the sake of this conversation we will say the reiterate is work no it is um and but I but as far as kind of the joke there I'm really terrible I there's a lot that goes into these these conferences that people might not realize oh absolutely um the the big challenge this year was to get

our speakers right even though we had announced our conference States last year at the end of the conference we had a conflict with another major event with which we were competing for speakers so we had a lot of speakers that couldn't make it oh yeah they were down the river comes down and some other event in Chicago no fluff just stuff no flowers and stuff but luckily we were still able

to you know have 13 wonderful speakers and devote at oral session to lightning talks & A panel which featured four of our speakers we try to put a certain dose of entertainment so we had a couple Kenneth and jeopardy game and some other events that we do every year and I think having the introductions by different people absolutely so so between sessions when a new speaker was coming up it

wouldn't always be the same person introducing the speaker and there was one little snag as there always is in anything anything more one of the speakers had gotten locked outside right and butts because of having you know a person up there that was comfortable that you talk and kind of yes the control the room a little bit and right we had a bunch of software jokes and

very it was wing pretty well as Gary made it just went 3-4 minutes late yeah okay we're a little bit in our side as well but that's that's what shows a stronger organization is being able to be resilient through those kinds of hurdles absolutely and but also other things that about just like the cost and expensive of doing a conference I

remember our conversation you and I had before where you mentioned that previous years I don't know if it's last year to hear before water bottles for a ridiculous ridiculously expensive yeah it aside the main cost for the conference is really food beverages and the venue we've detached ourself from the hotel because years ago we had an experience but right there's consumption

costs that we are not necessarily so when you do receivable and you take the bottle of water keep it because it might be really expensive and it might affect whether or not there's give me comments again next year right and we're always looking for sponsors I mean I want to really say clearly that events like this could not be produced if it wasn't for the help of the sponsors so that we can

I don't know if you've noticed but as cnas price is the same that we've had for and for as long as I remember putting the conference together and it's getting to be a stretch it's a bit difficult to maintain that low price within competing for sponsors because they're also looking at okay if I if they're a ruby company or they provide ruby services are gonna already pre

allocating for a direct ruby conference now you're competing for those dollars just because you have a broad spectrum anything that if somebody was looking at how they could maybe look at starting their own conference in an area what are you have any other little tidbits you might think of that if somebody's looking at a conference that they might want to just think about before they get

into it what are you know you mentioned costs and sponsors but right the the biggest part is the venue I found the best couple of years we've had this venue which is vitally fantastic but it's not a hotel venue so we we are able to limit the cost and limit the liability because when you do book a conference in a hotel depending on where you do it he's best experience in

Chicago they have some sort of ratio of hotel rooms to meeting space but with the technology nowadays it's not uncommon for people to find really cheap rate elsewhere leaving you with a liability for hotel rooms that are actually not right because they don't seem to be giving you an optimal weight yeah they're they're charging touch sticker price I end up yeah yeah I

definitely can say that I first thing myself when I go to a conference i'm looking at hip mom you'd eyelids you know it's i would love to support the conference but sometimes it's just the rates are so high that it's right almost for her b events to even like goal as an attendee night exactly so that's why by not by not having a hotel than you we're able to leave the tourists to the people

as to what tools they want to do right what they want to use to find the accommodation great extent its origin much like we were trying to write our good software we d couple things i know you're not a software person but he's gonna miss all but uh anyway I know you're very busy and I'm catching around a little I appreciate you taking access early i'll make you thank you very much

hi i'm mike with geektastic i'm sitting here with Mike Bush who is one of the facilitators for code and coffee here in Chicago hi Mike thanks for for sitting down with me can you tell me a little bit about what's coding coffee is um so code and coffee is a group of developers that meet up once a week and just basically hack on whatever the heck we like to hack on so um you'll find people

doing all kinds of like from beginners to advanced people doing Ruby closure JavaScript see crazy stuff I don't know like reading blog posts writing emails it's just a time to get together in the morning once a week with other people who are also developers and how does one sign up for so our group is very very ad hoc it meets at 7am so the expectation is not that anyone should need to RSVP

or commit to being there like if you wake up at seven o'clock in the morning I don't care if you really make it there um I hope that you do but yeah but I can't like yes so it's very it's all your deck yet it's very casual it's a weird expectation like say yes you need to RSVP for the 7am thing it's just too much pressure yeah so it's it's worse like in the evening it might be a little

bit more formal and structured this is more hey let's get together and kind of hack on stuff yeah and and or even socialize yeah so the the one of the things about no RSVP is also very little there's very little structure to a code and coffee like we don't have to organize speakers we don't have to organize food and in that we just pick a pic a coffee house and go there yeah we

choose starbucks because they have open Wi-Fi and that's all there and it's centrally located here in Chicago but aside from that anybody could do this at any coffee channel yeah yeah but isn't there a UH there is kind of a loose affiliation or my thinking of breakfast or something at that I know that there's also a keeper okay all right now mr. buzzers and we I don't do

anything with geek breakfast but it's like coding coffee just a unique thing to Chicago or is there no so code and coffee my first experience of code and coffee was in Columbus Ohio where Tim Wingfield organized that meet up its Sun mostly the same here as it wasn't Columbus Tim just picked a coffee shop and told a bunch of people he'd be there hacking on Ruby stuff so bunch of us

showed up Tim sometimes chooses topics which I don't do here in Chicago but most of the time it's very freeform yeah and both things I tried to keep it with a lot of the way that Tim did his because I like that and I missed that when I came here to Chicago and we didn't have our own group okay cool um with comparing to do you enjoy that the fact that it's less structured versus

going to use we do you go to any user groups and I mean was this was this coming out of like uh you know I go to a meeting and the necklace and these speakers or is it like I just want to get up and do something one in my head's freshen yeah so I go to a lot of user groups or what I considered a lot of these are groups um I know there are people who go to three or four weeks and

that's crazy but whatever um but yeah so so my group was much more about like just getting together very casually I often finally lat user groups like I'm there and interested about the talk but really i'd rather be just hacking with the people who are there and so this group is sort of like just don't worry about any of that talk stuff and let's get right to like hacking and

socializing and sort of networking with and meeting new people sometimes gives you an opportunity to teach newcomers like it's a great way to engage the community without like having the pressure of a full-out meeting to organize yeah and I think you joked what core Haines said it was his favorite favorite user group or favorite morning activity is said that on Twitter okay

Alan blog post so this it's well documented yeah if I if I didn't have such a commute I would definitely come down but it is it always sounds like fun you guys tweetin its people are saying oh I did you know hacked on this thing or did this thing for the first time I see those in the Twitter stream a lot it's definitely brutal to wake up at seven a.m. in the morning if you're like

a nine o'clock a.m. person getting to work that's it's two hours earlier than normal yeah one of our guys who was at the original meeting Blake Smith he actually had to be up at 430am to make it to the to the train station by 5 30 so he could be at the meeting by seven yeah that takes commitment and yeah I do not fall because I no longer coming like it's just ridiculous okay well thank you

very much for talking with me yeah it's been fun

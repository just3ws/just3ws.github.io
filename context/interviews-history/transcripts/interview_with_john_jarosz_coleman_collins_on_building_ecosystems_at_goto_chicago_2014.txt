hi it's mike with you tastic i'm here at go to come for 2014 senator with john and coleman who gave a talk on building an ecosystem oh thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me i can you tell me a little bit about what your talk was what does it mean to build an ecosystem sure we focus on building a program of different products that made this grocery and restaurant store really

get off the ground in a short amount of time and so that meant a collection of bespoke built software and products for that need but also purchasing things off the shelf tweaking them and customizing them for the client and then we also build the services that stitch all of those together so was that like a live coding thing or moresee walking through oh yeah it was it was a series of

stories around the different products that we built the different challenges we faced with kind of the general theme that we didn't need to have all the problems figured out up front what we had was a good process and that helped us figure out the problems as they arose so that that spend all the way from technical to experience that problems yeah so part of our talk was how we

switched between agile and lean principles as we needed to to accomplish those different goals okay and you know the word ecosystem and this is kind of a theme we have very loaded terminology in this conference I've noticed that is that ecosystem can mean a lot of different things what do you mean by ecosystem oh that's a tough haha I think I see it and I think we both will have

answers to this hope I see it very much almost as a living breathing program like I think why why it needs ecosystem to me is because if we have an established program and we add something to it it doesn't become as simple as making another product or tool what you have to do then is tweak something in every other element to best integrate that and make it all flow together and

because all of these things become intertwined and dependent on each other and and because they change as a whole rather than an individual that's why it means ecosystem to me yeah it really the distinction is that iterative doesn't mean piecemeal right when we change something in one product often that would have ripples and we had a lot of different

products to ultimately serve this large restaurant space as well as a lot of operational needs on the on the client back end so we changed one product for example the quick payment app that we met made what that meant is we also need to change things about their physical space maybe to change things about the way our web service is consumed that information and that's why it's an

ecosystem not just a collection of products all right yeah so so this isn't simply just a matter of oh I need a blog bring in WordPress it's more of what what is it that this this company trying to do with a specific product once RN need and which services can be just pulling or do we have to create like how do you decide whether to go with the create vs bill versus x well I think you

know one of the key components to that was we had a really strong strategy and product management team and everyone participated in that so it was certainly led by people with experience in that field but we were all integrated into those choices and so we made really intentional calls when we would so for example we bought the POS system we licensed revel and customized it for our

client protozoal is an ipad point-of-sale system yeah and then but we did build those services from scratch and we built the market pass app from scratch which works with rebel and so we really also you know put those together and made them play off of each other so there's a lot more of its more glue that's that's the bespoke code or I think you have to build the glue as well

so it's like it's not like doing just WordPress yeah it's like you also have to build the browser all right okay sorry it can be it really depends on what the need of that specific customer yeah absolutely yeah and the the value of building the glue to extend that metaphor is that when we realize that there is something that we can't buy that we need to really kind of complete

an experience or complete a specific flow we can then build that and know that will integrate well and I think something that might make this context a bit clearer is that we were bill doing these series of products for a physical space so you can even technically think of them just like real objects right because it was for a restaurant grocery hybrid all of these

things actually went somewhere and were picked up in touch by people weren't necessarily invisible so this even led to decisions about who might be doing your supply for groceries and things like that not just not just what software do you use for the point of sale or for the menu online system but actually how do you get the materials to cook the food to send to you know to

serve your customers we realized towards the end of the program that we had the customers as a user base but we also have the associates people who are actually working there as user base and we ended up spinning up an entire another stream of work around training and self-service tools to let the associates do the best that they could divest serve the customers right because

the whole goal was to use technology to empower a great customer experience and sometimes that meant just empowering other human stuff with that right and so this sounds like it's a lot more like a few years ago then for Yahoo pipes and there's if then this if this then that's kind of in interactions between different services and api's this is a lot further beyond that and it goes into

more the depth of actually building ASAP I'm gonna have to edit that one out because I can't even think building a building us a lyric stories yet that is integrated with technology this is going beyond just oh I have a website and I'm going to maybe do some dropship absolutely and it's how that how that website effects what's going on in the store we've now those apps affect what's

going on in the store is there anything that you know when you came out of this this product and you're now looking back and you're going to write this presentation what were some of the highlight things were kind of really surprise you or where you learned and that you wanted to share in this presentation like the one thing you particular that that's a hard that's our

new students will you do it all do one okay I think one of my favorite things is that we release the rich tree app which is currently in the ios and android store we also released a actual plastic card version of this app what I'm quite proud of is that we created both a very accessible version which is free and anyone can pick up this wooden card will

act as your loyalty card requires no technology for us so we don't always need to use tech to solve problems but we were able to create a super accessible and free item which contained our core value proposition without their roading the value that the mobile app created the mobile app allows you to do things in more real time it also allows you to pay and also uses the core

feature of loyalty so we would didn't have to compromise on the value of either those and we're able to basically create something for the super connected user and leverage that tech to have a stronger store experience but we didn't compromise on the core value prop by having it very accessible and free wooden card that you can come in and take so it sounds like you recognize

that may be the be-all end-all isn't you force technology on people someone else is the lowest that sometimes people just like to have a thing you could be as exact as you know we realized not everyone had an unlimited data plan right like we just realize things would go wrong and you shouldn't be forced to have to do all these things to access some of our great time free in you were

oh yes so mine actually was the we met we built a app an iPad app that was our all of our menus for the restaurant that was for the bar so the restaurant is generally basically a food court where all of the stations are in fact owned by the same restaurant except for the bar which is a full-service bar table service everything else they can also order from any of the other stations and

we became so well known essentially for being pivot friendly and the way that we were doing things that they came to us 10 hours before store launch like store first opening and said we need a menu for the bar and we were able to because of the way we get built everything because of the way that we were considering the entire experience and knew that we were going to be wrong and

going to be learning up until Opening Day but that it was kind of a ridiculous request but it was actually doable right we managed to because we could just consume same web services because we could use the same exact styling that was used in the menu boards and elsewhere with a huge weeks we will actually get this thing out the door which was not only

kind of put the cherry on top of this holistic user experience that use technology not as kind of your flash bang we were in Annapolis where you weren't selling technology we're selling food all right we're selling good customer service and in that that was kind of one of the last things that really felt good in kind of we are we are actually empowering our customers to

really have a great time here I'm going to enjoy the food not to look at the app but to know what food they can buy quite literally and I have to read the water if that that ability to deliver a such a time-sensitive solution help to build more trust from from your direct clients and absolutely it's part of how we got the request in the initial spot I mean we had to really earn the right to be

their tech partner we didn't walk in it wasn't based strictly on our brand they didn't come in and ask us to just take charge of all of these things we earned it over time and the lean and agile process helped us to really do that because we were able to make changes based on their changing business needs because they had a six-month deadline in this store was going to open whether our

tech was ready or not yeah so we had to hit that construction deadline and they didn't have everything figured out and so they needed a group like us that could change over time where they didn't have to present us with all the answers to get started and I'm sure to close you so that there is an app on iOS store that people can go and check out to just kind of see what yeah yeah it's it's if

you search rich tree r IC h TR EE it'll come up but unfortunately if you don't live in toronto it'll be pretty much useless like I said the technology is in service or the customer experience which means if you're not in the store secondly the the app which I can actually show you the app which looks like that here is something that yeah is a is so it's a quick play barcode that's

kind of QR impaired exactly yeah which means that if i'm not in the story this this app is basically useless right which is the point we didn't make it out that you can play with because we're not this company doesn't sell apps they sell food okay well thank you very much ridiculous trick media is really interesting great thanks so much user groups with lots to say interviews and

hi I'm Mike I'm at Chicago webcam today with humor McMillan who works with the Mozilla open source well we all know Mozilla we all know Firefox but there's also a Firefox OS that is is coming out in kumar's working with the team to help interact with the community your own team so tell us a little bit about what Firefox OS is yeah sure okay so um mobile apps have been kind of dominated

by Android and iOS and so at Mozilla we just really wanted the web to be the platform for mobile apps yeah and so we set out almost about a year ago to build a phone basically that's ruined by the gecko engine and you actually have one of those phones on you I do it's a real thing it's nice it's happening it's there you can't probably can't see it from the App the camera here but it's

this is this is working and it's it's a I mean it's been open from day one and so that sort of been a pretty pretty interesting part of the project yeah so as soon as we started committing code to the gate repo we just had people come out and sort of say hey Mozilla we've been doing the same thing in secret yeah yeah let's discuss my work together yeah and and build a phone together and so

that sort of been the open source community it's your company out from the shadows and said hey let's actually start contributing to this thing and make it better for everybody yeah they're going to benefit with some of those kind of benefits yeah definitely yeah and we have people I mean I tell a lot of people that one of the one of the first times that stirred started digging

into the project I was working on IRC with someone to help me kind of get it built and I was having some some problems and I was you know this guy to help me out and then I was like oh hey you know do you you know I work from was ill in Chicago where you were and and he said oh no I'm I'm in Greece haha I don't work for Mozilla you know yeah somebody just just on the project and

that's true how open it is anyone can jump on IRC anyone could get involved anyone can start submitting patches you know we have the telefonica guys who are helping us do the launch in Brazil and they're committing to our repo every day they're committing to get they're putting their assigned bugs in our bugs little track or they're just part of the project you

know so is when you're working on the open source project especially one as vegas and the Firefox browser is a huge project but I can only imagine how you je les project is is there like oversight from Mozilla and like like a direction and then people just pick up things that interest them and they want to help out with or how does how does the community interact with this yeah

well it's really focused as in you know mozilla employs a lot of people to be working on this project and so you know there's there's like any project there's there's deadlines and you know there's there's a huge kind of you know Qi infrastructure there's a big code review process for forgetting patches into the main line but there's but like said there's just a lot of involvement from

the community we're working with people you know now to our strategic partners like the telephonic and network also Qualcomm who is working on some of the chips also you know people in Europe and and a lot of people were just here that that we now kind of have some professional working relationships with key of shipping a phone but because it was open source they basically you know

we didn't sort of say we didn't come to them behind closed doors okay so kind of like with the Linux projectors you know lettuces is lynus has come out with some pretty strong and opinions on how people should contribute do does mozilla have its own kind of guidelines that people can look at and say oh this is how i can should you how I kid oh yeah definitely definitely but it's pretty structured I

mean you have to UM before any patch gets accepted I mean it has to go through a pretty extensive review process and I'll you know a lot of that is just you know stylist it's its stylistic reviews but also you know just we need to make sure people are using the right api's and when you know people aren't so familiar with you know really low-level parts of the system part of

the code review will be like oh no you need to like you know pass messages back and forth with this API instead of magazine just stuff like that and that keeps the quality at a good level you know and the you kind of talked a little bit about this needs interaction with this kind reason is not even on the team but he's just helping you because he wants to contribute has there been any

other kind of really interesting interactions with people contributing from the community good or bad just is there anything the lid pops to mind aside from yeah well it's I actually work more specifically on the marketplace which is our App Store for the phone and so I work also on payments and so that's it's it's a web site it's it's a Python run website so that's kind

of this standalone project it's a little separate from Firefox OS and it's been kind of hard to get outside contributors involved in that okay we have a lot of documentation for how to set it up it's not really easy to set it up but you know we've documented everything so you can't set it okay but we've seen a lot of people jump in that you know find us wherever on the web they to see them as

those open source they see that the app store that we're building is open source and they try to get involved they kind of jump on IRC is like hey I spent a day building this project i'm stuck here and you know we try to help them but sometimes everyone's busy in yeah you guys always help like you'd like to you yeah so people kind of come and go like that with with open sores that yellow

frustrated and and then they leave so you know we're doing stuff to make it easier we're making like you know vagrant images so that people can just do like a one-click install and have a virtual machine that it's running a development version of the app store so we're actually we make a really strong effort you know time permitting so that we can get outside

contributors because that's that's the core of Mozilla Mozilla is not the size of Google you know or you know the people were kind of competing with you know art the size of Mozilla like the employees it's basically the size of a single project at Mozilla for example like the Google+ team is probably the size of all of Mozilla I'm you know yeah that's a little scale difference yeah

yeah so we're trying to build a phone and we're just Mozilla you know so it's actually a you know one of the things we've always done and the reason why firefox has been so successful you know in and what it set out to do which was like you know make the web a kind of level playing field take over Internet Explorer which no one thought was possible at the time is because we

worked with the community Brandon because it's open source and up just before we wrap up here you work with a online radio station yes you just give a little plug for that and then describe what you're doing there because you said that also open source yeah it's trip reorg and it's you know it's funny yet I tell people it's it's it's a non-profit just like Mozilla and and in a lot of

ways it's it's similar to Mozilla but at obviously very much smaller scale um everything is open source all our software is open source and and we really work with the community as much as possible it's built entirely by volunteers and and it's it's a lot of fun because somebody want to listen to what kind of music is it it's all kinds of music radio network we broadcast

about 18 hours a day now so chirp chirp like isn't burning jet Shh IRP yeah okay one word trip radioed org I thank you very much thanks Mike

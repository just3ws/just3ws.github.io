  published_at: '2012-03-17'
  summary: Pat Paasch and Clark Sell founded angleBracket, a hands-on web-tech focused
    hackfest type users’ group up in the Far Northern Suburbs of Chicago. I attended
    a meeting and then recorded the interview at a post-meeting get-together at a
    local bar. Not the best sound quality but the meeting was a lot of fun and provided
    a great opportunity to spend a little time pairing and hacking on a variety of
    things in a relatively short time.

  summary: I bumped into Sam at SCNA 2012 and had a nice but short conversation about
    tech culture in Iran and what the tech community scene looks like. Iran is a country
    that is frequently focused on in US news for political reasons. Getting to talk
    with Sam was a great reminder that despite all the rhetoric by our governments;
    there are people who are interested in the same things as me and other programmers
    around the world.

  summary: Michael and I chat about building a technical event that is open enough
    for even non-techies to come out and have a good time. Kalamazoo X is a “soft-skills”
    conference targeted at developers. We discuss what types of speakers he looks
    for for Kalamazoo X and how he works with them to fit the framework of the conference.
    By keeping talks time down to a short 20 minutes the attention and energy level
    is better and can be kept up across multiple speakers. The duration helps avoid
    the drop in atten

  summary: Ryan Slobojan was at GOTO Chicago interviewing speakers for InfoQ.com and
    I managed to turn the camera around on him to learn more about his interviews.
    One of the interesting differences was whether the host is on camera. He wants
    to enforce focus on the subject while allowing himself to be the one-man band
    managing the tech side of the interviews. UGtastic interviews, for better or worse,
    are intentionally with the host on camera in an attempt to give the sense of three
    people in the room chat

2012 #chicago#python Scott Seely runs a .NET users’ group up in Grayslake, IL. He’s also extremely
active in the Chicago-land Microsoft Developer community that Microsoft recognized him as a Regional
Director. He explains why he founded LCNUG and what exactly is a “Regional Director”. Mar 18 2012
Pat Paasch and Clark Sell founded angleBracket, a hands-on web-tech focused hackfest type users’
group up in the Far Northern Suburbs of Chicago. I attended a meeting and then recorded the
interview at a post-meeting get-together at a local bar. Not the best sound quality but the meeting
was a lot of fun and provided a great opportunity to spend a little time pairing and hacking on a
variety of things in a relatively short time. Mar 18 2012 City Programmer, Country Programmer -
Building Rural User Groups Don’t live near a technology hub of a city? This blog post from Renae
Bair has some tips on getting one going. /via Ruby5 http://is.gd/RVHSaT Dec 16 2011 Am I missing
details about your UG? If I interviewed you and don’t have a link to your UG, please post a comment
to the appropriate post, ping me on twitter as @ugtastic, or email with more information about your
group at mdh@ugtastic.com. Nov 20 2011 My last interview of the SCNA 2011 conference was late into
the night with Bobby Johnson who handles speaker scheduling for the South Sound .NET UG in Olympia,
WA. Just a little comment, I was pretty much falling on my face exhausted from the day of the
conference at this point and it’s about 10:00 PM. Nov 20 2011 15 notes #south sound .net users
group#.net#south sound#washington Super awesome guy Dustin was kind enough to hang around so I could
interview both him and Michael Norton at the end of SCNA. Here we chat about starting up a Software
Craftsmanship UG in Pittsburgh. Nov 20 2011 19 notes #pittsburgh#pennsylvania#software craftsmanship
Michael Norton sits down with me to discuss helping to create and cultivate Ruby and Agile groups in
Cleveland and Pittsburgh. I also become unable to save many complicated words like “Cleveland” and
“Ruby”. Nov 20 2011 56 notes #cleveland#ohio#pittsburgh#pennsylvania#ruby#agile Zach and I first met
at Software Craftsmanship North America 2010 where we made a pinky promise to keep up with our
respective groups. I’m proud to say that pinky bond was held in the highest confidence as witnessed
by the Boston Software Craftsmanship Group. Nov 20 2011 Charley is working with several groups in
and around the Denver and Boulder Colorado area. He shares some insight into cross-group
collaboration and leadership. Nov 20 2011 2 notes #boulder#denver#colorado 1 2 Next Copyright ©

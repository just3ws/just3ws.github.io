Saturday, May 19th, 2012 - Grayslake, IL home register schedule sessions speakers sponsors FAQ
session lineup 4 ways to prevent code abuse speaker: Perry, Michael Your code is right. Other people
are just using it wrong! Learn 4 simple techniques to prevent people from using your code
incorrectly. We&#39;ll apply those techniques to a class in the .NET Framework that is really easy to
get wrong. By the time we&#39;re done, you&#39;ll have to try really hard to mess it up. Some APIs will
throw exceptions when you get something wrong. That&#39;s not helpful! I&#39;ll show you how to write an API
that guides you toward correct code. It won&#39;t even compile unless you get it right. These 4
techniques are built into the C# language today, so take advantage of them! Everybody on your team
will thank you. And you&#39;ll spend less time fixing their bugs. level: intermediate keywords: .NET,
patterns activejdbc and activeweb - take java to the next level speaker: Polevoy, Igor Stuck in Java
and looking to get a lot more productive? Come join us today for a talk from Igor Polevoy on how to
make your Java life easier - he will present ActiveJDBC, the implementation of Active Record in
Java, and ActiveWeb, a full stack web application framework in Java, both inspired by Ruby on Rails.
Learn how to increase productivity in Java as well as improve code quality with true TDD/BDD. Igor
is a founder of Express Pigeon, the email marketing system which was built on top of ActiveJDBC and
ActiveWeb level: intermediate keywords: active record, web framework, ORM, Rails async programming
with .net 4.5 speaker: Pereira, Sergio The .NET Framework doesn&#39;t lack support for asynchronous
programming. There are several ways to accomplish it. What we don&#39;t have yet is a way that doesn&#39;t
obscures the intent of the code. Consider the following question: What is more important, what the
code is trying to do or the fact that it was written asynchronously? If your answer was the former,
you&#39;ll probably like what you&#39;ll find in the Async CTP for Visual Studio. Come to this presentation
to see the new language features added to C# (and Visual Basic) that pretty much take asynchronism
out of your way while still embracing it. Find out how a couple new keywords can make your code
asynchronous and help you eliminate blocking calls without spawning new threads. level: intermediate
keywords: .net async c# bootstrapping clojure at groupon speaker: Jennings, Tyler This story starts
out literally like a movie - millions of dollars on the line and the clock is ticking. We had a
large dataset we needed to run expensive calculations on and our existing tools couldn&#39;t cut it.
Clojure came to our rescue with its wonderful combination of simplicity and performance. But that&#39;s
just the beginning. I&#39;ll also tell the tale of how our little Clojure script grew up. I&#39;ll talk
about how we constructed our test suite, our experience refactoring Clojure, and the delicate art of
introducing new developers to their first Lisp. level: intermediate keywords: clojure, agile build
advanced projects with robotics studio and microcontroller speaker: Maung, Min/Lwin Here’s a talk
that explains how the use of Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio (RDS) with microcontrollers enables
greater control and flexibility. We’ll build a project to build a service which will allow RDS to
talk with a Netduino. Visual Programming Language in RDS it makes it easy to consume these services
for advanced projects. level: intermediate keywords: Robotics, Netduino, Arduino, .Net
MicroFrameworks building ios apps with rubymotion speaker: Hightower, Ray RubyMotion is a tool that
lets Ruby developers write native iOS apps using the Ruby language. It&#39;s based on MacRuby which is
an implementation of the Ruby language for Mac OS X. This talk will introduce RubyMotion with some
simple live code demos and a twist of TDD. The level is introductory; you don&#39;t need to know Ruby or
iOS to attend. level: introductory keywords: Ruby, RubyMotion, TDD, Test Driven Development, iOS,
Objective-C, iPhone, iPad building rest api&#39;s using asp.net web api speaker: Rader, Devin In this
talk we will introduce the REST architectural style and look at what goes into designing a good REST
API and what you should expect when consuming a REST API. We will also look at the new ASP.NET Web
API stack that is part of ASP.NET MVC 4 and how it can be used to create REST API&#39;s. level:
introductory keywords: WebAPI, REST colors, fonts and crap speaker: Baltz, Jonathan If you are a
professional developer or a hobbyist, you may find yourself doing more design work than you ever
expected. This was not a problem, until you were told there were rules you had to follow for good
design. During this session, I will dive into a few basic topics such as the four basic design
principles that create the CRAP acronym, including what they are, what each one is referencing when
it comes to product and application design, and examples of each. I will also discuss the selection
and use of color in design. Finding the right colors that promote the correct emotions in people is
only the first step because you also have to make sure that the colors work well together. And the
final topic will be typography. People may already know the difference between a Serif font and a
Sans Serif font, but you should also know whether or not you can use both types in a single
application or how many different fonts should be used in an application. level: introductory
keywords: Design, principles, non-designer, colors, fonts cookies and sessions on rails speaker:
Jones, Colin We use cookies and sessions every day for authentication, identification, and
personalization, but how do they really work? We&#39;ll dig into HTTP, the Rails internals that make
things easy, and some ideas on keeping your web app secure. level: intermediate keywords: rails,
cookies, sessions cryptography (and security) for coders speaker: Lubinski, CM This interactive
presentation will cover many of the building blocks of modern security, with an emphasis on
cryptography. Topics include encryption, hashing, passwords, injection, session management, and
developer security. Dev-ops topics (such as server security, cloud hosting, application stacks,
etc.) and higher-level concepts (OAuth, cross-site scripting, architectures) will be also be touched
on if requested. Ideally, each topic will be a relatively dense 5 minute overview hitting the core
theory along with code samples. Topics will be chosen by audience participation (bring your voices.)
Details for the talk will be taken from my experience, academia, OWASP, Security Now, and an
assortment of security-focused presentations and papers. The talk will assume little to no prior
security knowledge, though we won’t spend much time on anything you already know. Presentation
available here: http://cmlubinski.info/cryptography-and-security-coders level: intermediate
keywords: cryptography, security decoupled communication with messaging speaker: Mulley, Doug
Communication between parts of a distributed system can add complexity and constraints to already
complex systems. When the communication protocols tightly couple the components, ensuring
configurable scalability and availability can be difficult. Messaging offers a flexible solution to
decouple the components of distributed systems. I&#39;ll present how messaging works, show how it is
implemented within an application, and talk about how I&#39;ve used messaging to solve some real-world
problems. level: intermediate keywords: messaging, distributed architecture, scalability,
availability, decoupling developing a website using wordpress speaker: Acton, Heather WordPress is
the most popular content management system built from PHP and MySQL. It speeds up the website
development process, and helps developers create websites that clients can manage on their own. For
developers who have been looking to get more efficient through use of a CMS, this session should
prove very helpful. By the end of the session, attendees will know how to install WordPress at a
good host; choose, install, and configure a theme; choose, install, and configure key plugins; and
how to own a WordPress site ongoing (updates, content creation, SEO, etc.). level: introductory
keywords: WordPress, CMS, Website Development development of cross platform apps using qyoto and qt
speaker: Alstadt, Jeff Qyoto is a language binding of the Qt framework and helps to bind the C#
language to the Qt GUI C/C++ framework. This talk will provide an introduction to the Qyoto
framework and will take a close look at how a developer can use Qyoto to develop apps for Mac OS X,
Linux and Windows. The talk will also expose the Qt concepts of Signal/Slot and Qt MVC concept using
Qyoto. In this talk, I will show campers an example of how to deploy a simple app using Qyoto on the
Linux, OS X and MS Windows platform to collect event data from a meetup event. If time permits, I&#39;d
also like to cover some of the Qt Android work that has been going on with the Ministro and
Necessitas SDKs. These SDKs are opening a lot of opportunities to port existing Qt apps to the
Android tablet and phone. Talk Time Outline (10 mins) Background Behind Qt, Qt Platform, and Qyoto
(10 mins) Introduction to Mono (10 mins) Go over simple code example of Hello world using
MonoDevelop (10 mins) Show simple Qyoto app using the level: intermediate keywords: Qt, MVC, Qyoto,
C/C++, C#, Mono f# &gt; c# speaker: Erickson, Aaron You have heard the arguments. When you get down to
it, it is all IL, right? Doesn&#39;t that make C# and F# the same Hogwash! In this talk, we will explore
those areas where F# has distinct advantages over F#, including: Immutability by default Domain on a
page Pattern matching Computation expressions The eradication of null Use what you learn from this
talk to be able to, very confidently, make the case for F# to your friends, your colleagues, and
greater &quot;powers-that-be&quot;. Or at least understand why you should stop putting off that nagging
&quot;finally learn F#&quot; to-do item that has been in the back of your head all these years. level:
intermediate keywords: F#, C# geofencing in ios speaker: McMahon, Kevin A geofence is a virtual
perimeter around a location of interest and, as of iOS 5, developers can utilize geofences to offer
a new range of location-aware features in their apps. In this session we will learn the basic
concepts behind geofencing and how to integrate geofencing into iOS apps. level: intermediate
keywords: ios, mobile, geofencing, corelocation going parallel with c++11 speaker: Hummel, Joe The
new standard of C++ has been ratified, and it only took 8 years! C++11 contains tons of new features
-- this talk will focus on the new concurrency-related features of C++11, including lambdas, auto,
threads, and futures. We&#39;ll also discuss how C++11 integrates with Microsoft&#39;s own concurrency
efforts, in particular asynchronous and parallel programming using Tasks and the PPL (Parallel
Patterns Library). level: intermediate keywords:
parallel,asynchronous,Tasks,PPL,Threads,Futures,Async go stands for awesome speaker: Degutis, Steven
In a world of chaotic language wars, a new contender takes a stand, in a valiant fight.. to the
death!! Go is not only capable but ideal for the domains that are currently occupied by Python,
Ruby, Rails, Clojure, C, and C++. Web apps, command-line tools, even sophisticated GUI frameworks
are the perfect use-cases for this up-and-coming language. We&#39;ll discuss some features that Go
brings to the table, some that it intentionally omits and why, and the philosophy and reasoning
behind Go that makes it one of the best languages we have available. level: advanced keywords: go,
awesome, future, language, concurrency, parallelism, awesomeness, golang, c, ruby, python, clojure,
rails gui architecture - using design patterns in your client js speaker: Jansen, Mike jQuery
plugins are great for standalone features, but when your client-side code base starts to grow and
your Javascript moves beyond one-off actions, you need ways to organize your code. Don&#39;t reinvent
the wheel! Instead, come learn about common GUI design patterns like Data Bindings, Observers, Event
Aggregators, as well as what MVC really is. We&#39;ll talk about how the theory behind these patterns,
how to use them in practice, and how they are used in popular frameworks like Backbone.js and
Ember.js. level: intermediate keywords: Javascript, Design Patterns, GUI, Architecture, Backbone,
Ember ikickass - effective tdd for ios speaker: Smith, Eric If you&#39;ve read anything on Test Driven
Development you know the process works like this: Write a little test. Write a little code. Refactor
Profit happily while working 40 hour weeks on bug free code, never being confused or stumped, and
riding a Unicorn to work. Right. It doesn&#39;t work that way. We all know it. TDD in any framework, let
alone one as tightly coupled as Cocoa is, can be an exercise in sheer frustration. Code that can&#39;t
be tested, code that takes forever to test, and This is exacerbated by sample code and frameworks
that either don&#39;t have TDD in mind or just use bad design practices. We&#39;ll take an irreverent tour
through the real TDD design process (which goes TDTDTDFUUUUUU) and show ways to truly Refactor you
code to take advantage of the benefits of testing without nearly as much difficulty. level:
intermediate keywords: iOS, iPhone, Objective-C, fun introduction to chrome extension development
speaker: Kim, Steve In this hands-on session, attendees will get an introduction to developing
Chrome extensions. Please bring your laptops! level: introductory keywords: chrome, html, css,
javascript introduction to the windows installer xml toolkit (wix) speaker: Sniderman, Daniel While
the new Web Deployment Features have made deployments of .NET Web Applications easier, for other
application types (such as WPF, Windows Services, and Windows Forms) “Windows Installers” (MSI
files) are often the best alternative. Since Visual Studio 11 will no longer provide the &quot;Setup
Project Type&quot; to easily create MSI’s .NET developers will need to consider other options. While
there are some powerful (and expensive!) commercial products to do this - one free alternative is
the Open Source Windows Installer XML Toolkit (WIX). While WIX has a steep learning curve (as the
MSI’s themselves are quite complex) WIX is a viable alternative given its strong features set and
high level of support. This presentation will give an introduction to WIX and show how to create an
install (and configuration) for a Windows Service, an install for Windows Client (and its shortcut)
with considerations for handling configuration files and automated build. level: intermediate
keywords: .NET,WIX,MSI intro to clojure web apps speaker: Martin, Micah This session will introduce
tools and techniques to build web apps and deploy web sites from the ground up in Clojure. Joodo
will be the tool of choice. We&#39;ll see how it makes web development easy. And watch out for the
paradigm shift. As a functional language, Clojure requires fundamentally different approaches to
solving problems. We&#39;ll have fun comparing and contrasting. level: introductory keywords: clojure,
web dev ko your asp.net mvc speaker: Burnell, Keith It seems like every week a new JavaScript
framework is being raved about in the Twitterverse. What is a JavaScript framework? What benefits
would I get from using a JavaScript framework? I am an ASP.NET MVC developer; can I use a JavaScript
framework? In this talk Keith will answer all of these questions and dive into one of the most
popular JavaScript frameworks; Knockout. Keith will cover how you using the power of Knockout you
can make your ASP.NET MVC Views more object oriented, responsive and maintainable. level:
introductory keywords: javascript, knockout, mvc mozilla open badges - less yack, more hack speaker:
McAvoy, Chris Mozilla&#39;s Open Badges project (http://openbadges.org) is an effort to recognize life
long learning. Learning happens everywhere, not just in the classroom, skills learned on the job,
online, or in self-directed pursuits should be acknowledged. Badges help solve the problem, Mozilla
Open Badges allow for the issuing of portable, transferable badges that a learner has total control
of. Organizations like NASA, Pixar, and the Smithsonian are all working on OpenBadges compliant
badging systems, but the system is easy enough that even a small site can issue a compliant badge.
We&#39;ll talk a bit about the history of Open Badges, how to integrate them into your own projects, and
how to contribute to the wider emerging learning ecosystem. The Open Badges infrastructure (OBI) is
an open source project on Github, http://github.com/mozilla/openbadges. The OBI is built on the
Node.js and Express. We&#39;re using Mozilla&#39;s Persona / BrowserID system for authentication level:
intermediate keywords: openeducation, node, opensource on the inception of the ruby object system
speaker: Love, Justin Class, superclass, metaclass, singleton class, eigenclass, class &lt;&lt;self, class
Class, Class.new. We all know that Ruby is an object oriented language, and specifically it is a
class based language. One of the strengths of Ruby is that it can be extremely usable without having
to really understand what&#39;s going on behind the scenes. Drift from the happy path, however, and you
can find yourself wandering in a dream-world of class&lt;&lt;self or trying to grok the difference between
&#39;include&#39; and &#39;extend&#39;. This talk will try to explain why we have classes and metaclasses, and how
it all hangs together (and a bit about the movie Inception, to keep things from getting too boring.)
note: this will be presented at ChicagoRuby level: intermediate keywords: ruby, oop, object, class,
metaclass open source node.js workshop speaker: Massa, Sean This will be similar to the event at the
Chicago Node.js meetup. Come prepared to write some code! This workshop will focus on building
features on top of an existing, small project. Attendees will form teams (or go solo) and take tasks
to work on. Instructors will be available to answer questions and discuss design decisions. Tasks
will range from easy to hard. You can also come up with your own features and implement them. The
purpose of this workshop is to get comfortable dealing with (1) other people&#39;s Node.js code, (2) the
Github workflow, (3) Open Source in general. When you complete your task, we can merge it into the
repository and test it out! If you don&#39;t complete it before leaving, you can keep working on it and
submit a pull request whenever you finish. Requirements: passing familiarity with node.js installed
node.js for your OS a github.com account level: intermediate keywords: workshop, node.js,
coffeescript, javascript, socket.io sharing code between client and server with node.js speaker:
Powers, Chris As Node&#39;s popularity grows, the &quot;Holy Grail of Web Development&quot; is within reach --
writing application code once and executing it both on the server and in the browser! I will share
lessons I&#39;ve learned from building out the Drumkit.js code-sharing framework and show how we are
using Node at Groupon to quickly build new Web applications with shared data models, view logic and
request routing. level: advanced keywords: Node.js, JavaScript, simplify your multi-core code
speaker: Glenn, Mark Building high performance applications has become more difficult as CPU speeds
have maxed out and CPU cores have increased. Threading by itself works well for long running tasks
and parallelization libraries are good for large data throughput. This talk will bring together
ideas about functional programming in everyday languages and managing an application as a task pool.
I will show how to avoid the usual threading issues (race conditions, deadlocks, etc.) by using
idempotent methods and immutable objects. Threaded programming isn&#39;t hard if you follow simple rules
during development. Focus topics: Threading, immutability, functional programming, and unit testing
threaded code. Mostly .NET examples, but should translate easily to other object oriented languages.
level: intermediate keywords: Parallelization, threading, functional programming simplify your wpf /
silverlight applications with caliburn.micro speaker: Eaton, Michael You&#39;re an application
developer, not a plumber (or carpenter), so why are you writing your own MVVM framework? Worse yet,
maybe you&#39;re jamming all sorts of code in the code-behind! Put down the pipe wrench (or hammer) and
pick up one of the best MVVM frameworks for WPF/Silverlight/WP7. Caliburn.Micro makes it extremely
simple to create solid, testable applications, while also reducing the amount of code you have to
write. level: intermediate keywords: xaml, wpf, silverlight, wp7, framework software bungee jumping:
elasticity in software design speaker: Buswell, Jim How do we make our software more flexible and
adaptable to changes, both functional and technical? What we need is software that can stretch and
contract like a bungee cord when necessary. By using elastic design in our software we can achieve
this flexibility. This session will discuss and demonstrate what elastic design is and how to use it
in your applications. I will walk through how you can use schema-less databases to increase the
flexibility of your persistence, how to create RESTful interfaces to allow dynamic and elastic
interactions between two endpoints, and how you can use cloud-based platforms to take advantage of
their elasticity to allow your application to grow with little effort from you. We will then tie
these together to show how they all work together in creating elastic applications. level: advanced
keywords: elasticity, cloud, NoSQL, REST windows 8 - the developer&#39;s view speaker: Cochran, Joel In
this session we&#39;ll take a quick tour of Windows 8 and then turn our attention to developer issues
and tools. Topics of discussion will include Desktop vs. Metro, .NET vs. WinRT, touch vs. mouse &amp;
keyboard, XAML vs. HTML, and more. Whatever your preferences, this presentation should help prepare
for the future of Windows. level: introductory keywords: Windows 8, Metro, WinRT, XAML, Blend,
Visual Studio working with sharepoint webparts speaker: Seely, Jean Take your .NET know to
SharePoint. Go through the steps of creating a WebPart, adding it to a SharePoint page and finally
connecting two WebParts so you can pass information from one WebPart to the other. level:
